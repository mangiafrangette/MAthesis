{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.51", "abstract": "<p>With relatively few scholars and a large number of texts whose manuscript transmission has yet to be mapped, Icelandic literature would benefit from efficient ways of establishing stemmas, to facilitate the study of literature, linguistics, scribal culture, and so Icelandic history more generally. This is also true for much medieval literature. Meanwhile, in saga-studies as in stemmatology generally, there has been little discussion of the role of sampling in textual criticism, even though most scholars must make heavy use of it. This article tests the viability of creating a stemma using a small sample of text by independently drawing a stemma of <em>Konráðs saga keisarasonar</em>, whose stemma was previously established in Zitzelsberger (<a href=\"http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/9/hall/#zitzelsberger1981\">1981</a>, <a href=\"http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/9/hall/#zitzelsberger1983\">1983</a>, <a href=\"http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/9/hall/#zitzelsberger1987\">1987</a>), and testing it against these prior publications. Although the approach has limitations, at worst it produces “known unknowns” which can then be resolved through targeted study; in practice it produces results very similar to those of Zitzelsberger; and in some cases it actually allows us to improve on his work. The article also capitalises on internet publication rigorously to include all underlying data and to experiment with new, more transparent, ways of publishing stemmas; and to use digitised data to provide a new overview of the long manuscript tradition of medieval Icelandic romance sagas. Finally, it describes and filiates two new manuscripts of the saga identified in Winnipeg by Katelin Parsons.

In mathematics, it is referred to as a <q>network</q> or a <q>graph.</q> The article's purpose is to emphasise how a relevant relational model of a historical corpus can serve as a theoretical framework which makes available automatic data mining methods designed for graphs. By such methods, for one thing, consistency checking can be performed so as to extract possible transcription errors or interpretation errors during the transcription automatically. Moreover, when the database is so large that a human being is unable to gain much knowledge by even an exhaustive manual exploration, relational data mining can help elucidate the database's main features. First, the macroscopic structure of the relations between entities can be emphasised with the help of network summaries automatically produced by classification methods. A complementary point of view is obtained via local summaries of the relation structure: a set of network-related indicators can be calculated for each entity, singling out, for instance, highly connected entities. Finally, visualisation methods dedicated to graphs can be used to give the user an intuitive understanding of the database. Additional information can be superimposed on such network visualisations, making it possible to intuitively link the relations between entities using attributes that describe each entity. This overall approach is here illustrated with a large corpus of medieval notarial acts, containing several thousand transactions and involving a comparable number of persons.</p>"},

A great demand for explication and analysis of Dante's poem sprang up in Italy immediately after Dante's death in 1321, and Boccaccio's <em>Esposizioni</em> forms part of this tradition. However, unlike other Dante commentaries, the <em>Esposizioni</em> was not written with the intention of becoming a <q>published</q> book: it is instead the notes for the public lectures on Dante which Boccaccio gave in Florence in 1373-74. The oral intention and nature of this text is one of the elements upon which the electronic <em>Esposizioni</em> project focuses.

This paper demonstrates the potential of a standard relational database, coupled with a GIS and Network Analysis software package, to make a spatial argument about the relative importance of key towns within a transport network and expose the constituent elements of that argument in a formal, visual manner."},
{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.6", "abstract": "The <em>Illustrated Incunable Short Title Catalog on CD-ROM</em> (IISTC), now in its second edition, provides an unrivaled wealth of information on fifteenth-century printing and, as a computer database, allows for rapid searching that would not be possible with printed reference works. However, the database's search interface suffers from numerous problems, as Paul Needham described in a thorough review essay. This article presents a solution to those problems that can be implemented by the end user, and also shows what kind of useful information can be obtained from the IISTC by doing so. The solution entails exporting all records to a very large text file, analyzing the file with scripts written in Perl, importing the information into a full-featured database application, and conducting queries with the database application's more robust and better documented interface. With the IISTC data directly accessible, the database fields can be manipulated to implement features missing in the original IISTC, including separate fields for each part of the imprint data and a count of recorded copies. Query-generated output demonstrated here include a table of incunables with the highest number of copies recorded in the IISTC; printers of Ulm, the number of their signed editions, and their dates; and the number of signed editions printed each year through the end of the fifteenth century. Sample scripts for recreating the results described here, as well as instructions for implementing them and a discussion of points to consider when doing so, are found in the appendices."},

The analysis and classification of the manuscripts in previous studies have been rather subjective. In an attempt to be objective we use contemporary research methods. Vector analysis allows one to separate the Putyatina Menaion and the Menaion Q.п.1.25 from the set of analyzed texts, since both manuscripts share both textological and lexical similarities. Similar findings were reached in existing studies. Manuscript BAN 16.14.13 is shown to be quite similar to the set of analyzed texts. The results are new to the literature.</p>"},
{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.66", "abstract": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital humanities scholarship contributes to current conversations on literature in many forms, especially in its recontextualizing of what it means to read. By integrating visual, spatial, and quantitative forms of knowledge alongside the practice of text-based hermeneutics, digital techniques expand the possibilities of interpreting texts, particularly with the emergence of widely available geospatial and data visualization tools. This article outlines and reflects on a methodology for producing geospatial and data visualizations of place names in the Icelandic outlaw sagas, and discusses how the results corroborate existing research and also facilitate critical methods of ‘reading’ these texts spatially. While articulating the saga-specific findings of the visualizations, this article also contextualizes the conceptual work of digital literary mapping as a method that is particularly insightful as we determine the role and validity of digital techniques, especially for interdisciplinary and historically-situated work.</p>"},

One of these projects draws on an open-source, web-publishing platform called Omeka and was designed for an interdisciplinary course on the archaeology and history of medieval London offered at Fordham University’s London Centre. The project aimed to give students first-hand experience with the material culture of a medieval city and consisted of two parts. The first, an Object Report, required each student to research and write a short essay on a single medieval object on display at the Museum of London, highlighting the significance of the object within the context of civic, religious, and domestic life in medieval London. In addition, students uploaded images and found illustrations of their objects in medieval manuscripts. The second part, a Site Report, required a visit to a medieval London location– a church, a monastery, or cemetery, for example– to research its significance in the middle ages. Students also uploaded images of their site, which they photographed themselves, and identified the site’s location on a (preferably medieval) map of London. Another similar project was designed using the Weebly web-editing platform for students taking Western Tradition I at Marymount California University, which does not have access to Omeka. Both the Omeka and Weebly projects allowed students to grapple with larger questions about integrating material objects into pre-modern history, but they were especially valuable for teaching students about the importance of being a responsible researcher since students contributed to a digital humanities project that made their research available to a wide public.</p>"},

Rich and diverse as it is, it is beset by numerous problems that have rendered it fragile and often inaccessible. The situation is such that many sites are unsigned. Others are very difficult to get to. And even others – ones that are more easily located – have erratic hours, essentially locking out the average visitor to Sicily unless s/he is willing to invest the time and have the language skills necessary to persuade residents in the surrounding area to get the access keys.</p><p>Given these challenges, we are developing <em>The Norman Sicily Project</em> to document the cultural heritage of medieval Sicily during its Norman period (in other words, c. 1061–1194) so that a wide audience can learn about what was once there and what still remains. The site attempts to reconstruct what we know about the society by bringing together images, basic identifying information, geolocation data and, in some cases, videos, using modern web development techniques. It also offers genealogical information and visualization tools that can help visitors understand the data in new ways as well as sustainability data related to the monuments’ physical states. The intention is that the project will offer scholars, students and the general public who are interested in Norman Sicily the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with each other while suggesting a web-based model for other medieval communities.</p>"},
{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.67", "abstract": "We propose an automatic method for attributing manuscript pages to scribes. The system uses digital images as published by libraries. The attribution process involves extracting from each query page approximately letter-size components. This is done by means of binarization (ink-background separation), connected component labelling, and further segmentation, guided by the estimated typical stroke width. Components are extracted in the same way from the pages of known scribal origin. This allows us to assign a scribe to each query component by means of nearest-neighbour classification. Distance (dissimilarity) between components is modelled by simple features capturing the distribution of ink in the bounding box defined by the component, together with Euclidean distance. The set of component-level scribe attributions, which typically includes hundreds of components for a page, is then used to predict the page scribe by means of a voting procedure. The scribe who receives the largest number of votes from the 120 strongest component attributions is proposed as its scribe. The scribe attribution process allows the argument behind an attribution to be visualized for a human reader. The writing components of the query page are exhibited along with the matching components of the known pages. This report is thus open to inspection and analysis using the methods and intuitions of traditional palaeography. The present system was evaluated on a data set covering 46 medieval scribes, writing in Carolingian minuscule, Bastarda, and a few other scripts. The system achieved a mean top-1 accuracy of 98.3% as regards the first scribe proposed for each page, when the labelled data comprised one randomly selected page from each scribe and nine unseen pages for each scribe were to be attributed in the validation procedure. The experiment was repeated 50 times to even out random variation effects."},
{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.81", "abstract": "This paper presents the methodology and the results of an analytical study of the three witnesses of Dante’s <em>Commedia</em> copied by Giovanni Boccaccio, focusing on the importance of their digital accessibility. These extraordinary materials allow us to further our knowledge of Boccaccio’s cultural trajectory as a scribe and as an author, and could be useful for the study of the textual tradition of Dante’s <em>Commedia</em>. In the first section of the paper, the manuscripts and their role in previous scholarship are introduced. A thorough analysis of a choice of variants is then offered, applying specific categories for organizing the <em>varia lectio</em>. This taxonomy shows how fundamental it is to combine the methodological tools for studying copies (as usual in medieval philology) and those for studying author’s manuscripts (as usual in modern philology) in dealing with the three manuscripts of Boccaccio’s <em>Commedia</em>: in fact, the comparative analysis of the three manuscripts has much to reveal not only of their genetic relationship but also of Boccaccio’s editorial practices. Furthermore, the analytic categories inform the computational model behind the web application ‘La <em>Commedia</em> di Boccaccio’, &lt;http://boccacciocommedia.unil.ch/&gt; created for accessing and querying the variants. The model, implemented in a relational database, allows for the systematic management of different features of textual variations, distinguishing readings and their relationships, without setting a base text. The paper closes on a view to repurposing the model for handling other textual transmissions, working at the intersection between textual criticism and information technology."},
{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.86", "abstract": "The many source texts that late medieval adaptors like Thomas Malory worked with constitute a potential wealth of information concerning the genesis of the linguistic and stylistic features shaping their works. As a result, their texts provide a useful framework for further developing and testing methods of stylometric analysis in the context of adaptation as a collaborative form of authorship. Our interdisciplinary team has undertaken a stylometric analysis of the eight different sections of Thomas Malory’s <em>Morte Darthur</em>, in order to identify differences between these sections and how they correspond to the language of the Old French and Middle English sources that Malory is known to have worked with in the different sections of his work. Our findings provide a basis for addressing unresolved scholarly questions concerning Malory’s Morte, such as the nature of the source used for his “Tale of Sir Gareth” and whether Malory himself was responsible for the differences between the two surviving versions of his “Roman War” episode in Book II of the <em>Morte</em>. They further shed light on ongoing controversies concerning the overall textual unity of the <em>Morte</em> and the process by which Malory created the different sections of his work—an issue that lies at the heart of broader debates concerning where Malory and other late medieval adaptors are to be situated on the continuum between “faithful translator” and “original author.”"},
{"string_id": "10.16995/dm.83", "abstract": "<p>The task of automatically separating Middle Dutch words into syllables is a challenging one. A first method was presented by Bouma and Hermans (2012), who combined a rule-based finite-state component with data-driven error correction. Achieving an average word accuracy of 96.5%, their system surely is a satisfactory one, although it leaves room for improvement. Generally speaking, rule-based methods are less attractive for dealing with a medieval language like Middle Dutch, where not only each dialect has its own spelling preferences, but where there is also much idiosyncratic variation among scribes. This paper presents a different method for the task of automatically syllabifying Middle Dutch words, which does not rely on a set of pre-defined linguistic information. Using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long-Short-Term Memory cells (LSTM), we obtain a system which outperforms the rule-based method both in robustness and in effort.</p>"},
