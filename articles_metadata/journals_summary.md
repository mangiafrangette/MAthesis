# Journals list
Here is a recap of all the journals with a brief description of how they are organized and why I took the articles I took. 

## Guidelines for DOIs selection
- Journals that do not provide for abstracts are excluded
- Thematic/special issues are included
- Conference and workshop proceedings are included in a separate section 
- Articles that do not have an abstract are excluded
- Articles published for the first time before 2000 are excluded
- When article types are distinguished, only original research papers are taken. They are defined as https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html#d4e5233 + @@@ look for other definitions from the journals. 
- Anything else (introduction articles, editorials, methods, opinion…) are excluded for the sake of coherence. 
- Retracted articles are excluded (rare)
