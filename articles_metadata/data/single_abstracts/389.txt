Pearsonâ€™s chi-squared test is probably the most popular statistical test used in corpus linguistics, particularly for studying linguistic variations between corpora. Oakes and Farrow (2007) proposed various adaptations of this test to allow for the simultaneous comparison of more than two corpora while also yielding an almost correct Type I error rate (i.e. claiming that a word is most frequently found in a variety of English, when in actuality this is not the case). By means of resampling procedures, the present study shows that when used in this context, the chi-squared test produces far too many significant results, even in its modified version. Several potential approaches to circumventing this problem are discussed in the conclusion.
