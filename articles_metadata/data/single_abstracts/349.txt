Digital Humanities (DH) has come a long way towards establishing itself as a dynamic and innovative field of study. However, it has been pointed out that the DH community predominantly comprises scholars from a handful of mainly English-speaking countries, and a current challenge is achieving a broader internationalization of the DH community. This article provides an overview of the landscape in terms of geo-linguistic diversity, as well as reviewing current DH initiatives to broaden regional and linguistic diversity and identifies some of the main challenges ahead. The aim of this article is to serve as a benchmark of the current situation and suggest areas where further research is required.
