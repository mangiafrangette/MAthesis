Recent advances in data science and machine learning have enhanced our ability to analyze and understand the structure of social interactions in fictional stories by using formal and quantitative approaches. However, an objective assessment of these aspects of fictional stories remains a relatively new and technically difficult field. In this brief report, we introduce our study in which we modeled story dynamics from a novel perspective. By implementing a relational event model based on a two-mode network framework in an analytical system for movie scripts, we examined the interdependence of character activities and their participation in a given plot on the basis of an analysis of more than 900 scripts from the Internet Movie Script Database.
