We describe an attempt to analyse the temporal structure of discourse in Modern Greek following the principles of Asher's Segmented Discourse Representation Theory. We focus on discourse relations of a temporal and causal interest and the use of linguistic knowledge for the determination of these relations. This analysis is applied to a corpus of short newspaper articles reporting car accidents in Modern Greek and the discourse grammar is implemented using the Attribute Logic Engine.
