This paper presents a stemmer for processing document and query words to facilitate searching databases of Amharic text. An iterative stemmer has been developed that involves the removal of both prefixes and suffixes and that also takes account of letter inconsistency and reiterative verb forms. Application of the stemmer to a test file of 1221 words suggested that appropriate stems were generated for ca. 95 per cent of them, with only limited overstemming and understemming.
