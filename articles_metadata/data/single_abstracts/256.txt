This article suggests that Jerome McGann’s proposal for social text editing can be applied to editions understood not as one author’s works, but rather as networks of publications by many authors and editors. The ability to create such an edition has been hampered in the past by the inability of HTML to express the semantic richness of TEI XML. However, by adopting the new semantic tags, custom data attributes, and schema.org microdata introduced with HTML5, an interoperable digital social edition can be feasible. The Grub Street Project, an edition of books, pamphlets, and data from 18th-century London, is a test of this premise.
