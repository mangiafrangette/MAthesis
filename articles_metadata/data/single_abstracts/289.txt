This article presents the integration of sentiment analysis in ALCIDE, an online platform for historical content analysis. A prior polarity approach has been applied to a corpus of Italian historical texts, and a new lexical resource has been developed with a semi-automatic mapping starting from two English lexica. This article also reports on a first experiment on contextual polarity using both expert annotators and crowdsourced contributors. The long-term goal of our research is to create a system to support historical studies, which is able to analyse the sentiment in historical texts and to discover the opinion about a topic and its change over time.
