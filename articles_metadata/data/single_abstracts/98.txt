This article describes methods that can be used to construct a Latin morphological and syntactic parser, including resources that enable reordering the sentence according to the SVO (subject + verb + object) standard order, aiming to facilitate the translation of Latin phrases by users. The article also addresses the solutions that can be implemented to overcome some of the problems found in this context, namely, the difficulties in accessing different forms of dictionarization, the lack of lexicographic resources, and a methodology for processing the ‘special constructions’ required by adverbs and adjectives.
