This essay emerges from the recent debates in editorial theory and, on the practical level, from a project for producing electronic scholarly editions. It reflects on the nature of text, explores the implications for text encoding in relation to recent debate, and outlines a methodology using stand-off markup within which text encoding can respond to the theoretically enunciated problems.
