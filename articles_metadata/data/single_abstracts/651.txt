Digital Humanities (DH) and Digital Library (DL) projects are complex systems that require specialized programming skills. Many encoders cannot take their work to the next level by transforming their collections of structured XML texts into a web searchable and browsable database. Often teams of text encoders are able to encode their texts with a high degree of sophistication, but unless they have funds to hire a programmer, their collections far too often remain on local disk storage away from public access. <teiPublisher> aims to relieve some of this burden by providing the tools to manage an extensible, modular and configurable XML-based repository which will house, search, browse, and display documents encoded in TEI-Lite on the world wide web. <teiPublisher> provides an administrative interface that allows DL and DH administrators to upload and delete documents from a web accessible repository; analyze XML documents to determine elements for searching and browsing; refine ontology development; select inter and intra document links; partition the repository into collections; create backups; generate search, browse, and display pages; customize the interface; and associate XSL transformation scripts and CSS stylesheets to obtain different target outputs (HTML, PDF, etc.).
