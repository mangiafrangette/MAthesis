Drawing on Digital Humanities as a specific, reflexive way of using new information technology to enhance learning, teaching, and research, this article describes a tool whose development began in 2011 with the goal of helping students, teachers, and researchers to share, transcribe, and comment on audio/video data without having to experience complicated software installation, regular overlap of windows, or strong versioning. From the definition of the requirements to the evaluation of the impact on teaching and research, the article stresses the importance of conceiving of techno-pedagogical tools as dynamic products, whose plasticity is a way to offset teething problems and apparent weaknesses.
