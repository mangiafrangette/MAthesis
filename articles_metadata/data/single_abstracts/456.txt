In order to investigate in explicit detail the way that y- and th- pronouns alternate in the Shakespearean corpus, I have undertaken a collocational analysis of the full corpus of Shakespeare's 37 plays and found that (1) second-person pronouns can be disambiguated based on context alone, (2) y- pronouns seem to be used in more formal situations or when an inferior is addressing a social better, and (3) the th- pronoun is reserved for addressing peers, servants, or other familiar personages. Through the Python Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al., 2009, Natural Language Processing with Python. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media), I implemented a Na√Øve Bayes classifier that in effect treats each occurrence of a second-person pronoun as a black box that must be resolved into either a y- pronoun or a th- pronoun based only on the surrounding words. Using tenfold cross-validation, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 78.3% when fellow th- and y- pronouns are excluded from the context and 88.0% when we allow fellow th- and y- pronouns to assist in classification. Most interesting, however, are the context words that prove most informative in categorizing the pronouns. Significantly, the words most useful in classifying a pronoun as a y- pronoun include high-register words such as lordship, madam, lords, and sir. After a group of conjugated second-person verbs like art and wert, the words most associated with th- pronouns are words such as torment, nuncle, lesser, and villain. The ability to discriminate between forms based only on context confirms the hypothesis that the two classes of second-person pronoun are indeed used distinctly in the Shakespearean corpus. The list of words most helpful in making that distinction strongly suggests a difference in formality. We can also gain additional insight into the plays by examining some of the unexpected words that collocate with either one form or the other.
