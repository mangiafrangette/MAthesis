Besides the Holly Quran, Nahj al-Balagha is the main source of literature in Arabian nations, especially for Shia as one of the main branches of the Muslims. Along with literary brilliance, the text of this book covers the broad topics. This research deals with the application of the statistical text and data analysis to extract knowledge from the aphorisms in Nahj al-Balaghah. First, we classify these aphorisms in seven topics. Then, the count of the aphorisms in each category is computed. Finally, the counts of the aphorisms of the categories are compared using the chi-square test and the cluster analysis.
