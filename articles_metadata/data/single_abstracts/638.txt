Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Prologue survives in both hand-written and early print witnesses dating from the 15th century. The introduction of material from more than one exemplar into a new copy results in contamination of a textual tradition. This contamination causes problems in standard phylogenetic analysis. We use an application of the maximum Ï‡2 method (developed for the detection of recombination in DNA sequences) to identify locations where scribes may have changed their exemplar whilst copying the tale. Our results are largely in agreement with other published sources, indicating that this method may prove useful in the analysis of a contaminated tradition.
