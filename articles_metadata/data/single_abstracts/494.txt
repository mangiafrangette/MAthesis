Of all American literary mysteries The Diary of a Public Man has been perhaps the most perplexing. Set principally in Washington DC, it covers a short but critical period in the nation’s history, the secession winter of 1860–61. The Diary entries are dated during the last months of James Buchanan’s ill-fated administration and the first 2 weeks after Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration. The publisher refused to name the author yet, despite the Diary’s anonymity, it has been used and quoted by historians for more than a century. It is clearly the work of an exceptionally gifted writer. The Diarist pictures himself as a strong Union man, much worried whether the crisis can be resolved without resort to war. Naturally there has been much speculation as to the Diary’s authorship. This article describes how traditional and non-traditional methods of authorship attribution may be employed on the Diary, which we believe to have been written by William Henry Hurlbert. We argue that the joint interdisciplinary approach employed in this article should be the way in which attributional research is conducted. Information on the traditional attribution section of this article is adapted from the forthcoming book by Daniel W. Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma: William Henry Hurlbert and ‘The Diary of a Public Man’ (Louisiana University Press, 2010)
