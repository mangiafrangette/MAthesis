The article describes an ongoing project that aims at building a reference corpus of German computer-mediated communication (CMC) as a new component of an already existing reference corpus of written contemporary German. The ‘Deutsches Referenzkorpus zur internetbasierten Kommunikation’ (DeRiK) shall include data from the most prominent CMC genres amongst German Internet users and, thus, close a gap in the coverage of the corpus resources in the project ‘Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache’ (DWDS), which are maintained and provided by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The focus of the article is on the role of the DeRiK component within the DWDS framework, on sampling issues, and on CMC-specific issues of corpus annotation.
