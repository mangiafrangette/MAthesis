In a range of courses taught in the English department at The College of Wooster, student use technology to interrogate ideas in ways novel in humanistic study. In an otherwise conventional seminar room, networked computers (to the Internet as well as locally) along the walls and both commercial and locally developed software tools represent the use of technology as ‘equipment for language’. As our description of how student use the tools (from page-layout programs to a new counting program) show, technology in this setting adds power to student' ability to question and therefore to understand—in the context of a kind of discussion as old as learning.
