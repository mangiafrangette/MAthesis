In this paper, we put forward a fully developed system for the teaching of Modern Greek Language (MGL). The system comprises a parser and generator for Modern Greek sentences as well as a computational lexicon, encoding morphological, syntactic, and semantic information for words. In this paper, we present the major components of the system, highlighting their suitability for the teaching of MGL in an experimental, open, and cooperative educational environment. The proposed system can be used either in a classroom environment or by Internet correspondence for the teaching of MGL as a native or foreign language.
