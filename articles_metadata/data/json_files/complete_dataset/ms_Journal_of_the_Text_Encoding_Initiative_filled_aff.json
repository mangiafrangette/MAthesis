Borrowing models of design research from the fields of design and human-computer interaction, I argue that prototypes can be used to create new conceptual knowledge, to investigate the values and assumptions of sociotechnical systems, and to communicate alternative visions of those systems. I first analyze an existing tool, the Versioning Machine, as a way of focusing the design of a prototype that reimagines several aspects of that original\u2014specifically, I argue that the Versioning Machine creates an environment that to some extent assumes that TEI documents are created by one editor and intended for one instantiation. The prototype presented experiments with an alternative vision of textual editing as bringing encoded texts and interpretations together in multiple and flexible instantiations. Rather than a technical problem with an optimal solution, I approach this design process as an opportunity to ask how prototypes can give designers access to conceptual issues and allow users to enact alternative values and imagine alternative futures.

However, because the choice of tags is guided by human interpretation, TEI-XML encoded files are in general not interoperable. One way to fix this problem may be to break down the current all-in-one approach to encoding so that DSEs can be specified instead by a bundle of separate resources that together offer greater interoperability: plain text versions, markup, annotations, and metadata.

The longer-term goal is for many organizations and projects to leverage those services so as to direct their own resources towards innovative tool or collection development. In addition, Bamboo seeks to model a paradigm for tool integration that focuses on tools as discrete services (such as a morphology annotation service and a geoparser service, instead of a web-based environment that does morphological annotation and geoparsing) that can be applied to texts, individually or in combination with other services, to enable complex curatorial and analytical workflows.

This data was designed to serve varying purposes: machine-readability was only one. A second goal was interoperability with digital NLP tools. To achieve this end, a uniform encoding system applicable across all the projects was developed. The paper describes the constraints imposed on the content models of the various elements of the TEI dictionary module and provides arguments in favour of TEI P5 as an encoding system not only being used to represent digitised print dictionaries but also for NLP purposes.", "article_title": "Creating Lexical Resources in TEI P5", "authors": [{"given": "Gerhard", "family": "Budin", "affiliation": {"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}}, {"given": "Stefan", "family": "Majewski", "affiliation": {"original_name": "G\u00f6ttingen State and University Library", "normalized_name": "State and University Library", "country": "Denmark", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/019ryn279", "GRID": "grid.437933.9"}}}, {"given": "Karlheinz", "family": "M\u00f6rth", "affiliation": {"original_name": "University of Vienna", "normalized_name": "University of Vienna", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03prydq77", "GRID": "grid.10420.37"}}}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012-11-06", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/jtei.508", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.4000/jtei.508", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "This paper describes work in progress on I5, a TEI-based document grammar for the corpus holdings of the Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache (IDS) in Mannheim and the text model used by IDS in its work.
