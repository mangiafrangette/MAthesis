Deeply integrated with the Oregon Petrarch Open Book Project (OPOB), the course was oriented towards the encoding of Petrarca\u2019s masterpiece based on the implementation of a network of different themes (Poet, Laura, Metaphysics Nature Metamorphoses and Urban Culture). The various occurrences and data obtained from the encoding were collected into an online database that is still operating and updatable. The results of this qualitative data collection were also compared with a quantitative computer-based research of selected keywords extracted from the various themes. From the beginning of the seminar, the class was divided into groups and each of them read the Rvf focusing on one of themes chosen while at the same time paying attention to the others. The different groups considered these themes as interrelated and interdependent. The poet is the sphere in which all the topics emerge in their specific connotations. However, his sphere is related to, dependent on and intersected with the other four spheres. The encoding allowed measuring the different manifestations, levels and meanings of the intersecting relationships. The study of the visual interpretation of the Rvf in the Inc.

The essay traces the history of the scholarship on Dante\u2019s Ovid, identifying its strengths and limitations, especially of the concordances in print. Since the intertextual passages in the Commedia require a reading not restricted to the obviously corresponding verses, but attentive to the broader textual contexts, I show how the digital concordance on Intertextual Dante greatly facilitates such a contextualized reading. The visualization of the corresponding passages (side by side, highlighted, within context) and the search options (by category of text reuse or by canto/book/poem) help the study of (Ovidian) intertextuality in the Commedia, as illustrated with examples from the site.", "article_title": "Digital Readers of Allusive Texts: Ovidian Intertextuality in the 'Commedia' and the Digital Concordance on 'Intertextual Dante'", "authors": [{"given": "Julie", "family": "Van Peteghem", "affiliation": {"original_name": "Hunter College, CUNY", "normalized_name": "Hunter College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00g2xk477", "GRID": "grid.257167.0"}}}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2015-09-23", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5399/uo/hsda.6.1.3", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.5399/uo/hsda.6.1.3", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "At its beginnings Humanities Computing was characterized by a primary interest in methodological issues and their epistemological background.

As the Web 2.0 evolves toward the Web 3.0, or the semantic web, community-engaged scholarship remains one of the most crucial components of this larger and more pervasive phenomenon and this also refers to the \"academic community\" at large. What is at stake is not only the transformation of the procedures of scholarly research and learning but also and more importantly the transformation of its goals: traditionally based (at least in the humanities) on the individual researcher and author, knowledge work, or the scholarly mode of production, is increasingly overhauled into a collective, collaborative enterprise, on a much larger scale. Moreover, the general move from discursive to graphic-algorithmic forms of data visualization and interpretation (including textual data), has eventful consequences for critical thinking: as humanists engaged with a potentially radical transformation of the community we belong to, our most daunting task is how to transpose traditional scholarly practices onto the new platform, envisioning new goals and outputs for our traditional tasks.", "article_title": "Change of Paradigm: From Individual to Community-Based Scholarship", "authors": [{"given": "Massimo", "family": "Riva", "affiliation": {"original_name": "Brown University", "normalized_name": "Brown University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gq02987", "GRID": "grid.40263.33"}}}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2015-09-23", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5399/uo/hsda.6.1.2", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.5399/uo/hsda.6.1.2", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "Collective Intelligence, the book in French, that Pierre Levy wrote before the existence of the worldwide web, when only the Internet existed, it's a philosophical vision of the future, a philosophical vision of what could be a global civilization based on the digital and the general interconnection of all the computers.
