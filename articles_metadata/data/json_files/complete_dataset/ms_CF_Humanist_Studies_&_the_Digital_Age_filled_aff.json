Schopenhauer includes Petrarch among his favorite authors, referring to him as \u201cthe poet of [his] heart\u201d and quoting him in those parts of The World as Will and Representation and Parerga and Paralipomena that center on the topics of ethics and the art of living. In this essay, I analyze Schopenhauer\u2019s most significant passages on Petrarch, suggest connections between those passages, and conclude that, for Schopenhauer, the Italian poet is much more than a poet; he is a true sage whose words one can turn to for comfort. Petrarch is a thinker, a promoter of solitary life and the love of knowledge, a writer of philosophy and, although only in part, even an ascetic man. From Schopenhauer\u2019s writing, it appears that Petrarch encompasses many of the features of the ideal Schopenhauerian man: someone who understands the senselessness of life, who has succeeded in denying the Will and has been able to express it through his poetry, his philosophical writings and his life choices. Petrarch\u2019s verses foreshadow the basic ideas of Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy; his actions and his example serve not only as a model and inspiration for the readers of Schopenhauer but also for the German philosopher himself.", "article_title": "Quanto piace al mondo \u00e8 breve sogno.

This appears to be possible by using a genealogical perspective that can recognize the underlying relationships between communication strategies that on the surface seem different.

Even literary language should be considered a medium that shapes and models reality, using codes that are anthropological before they are aesthetic. As Viktor Shklovsky, Italo Calvino, and Paolo Fabbri have shown, literary language explores reality by revealing its incompleteness. On the contrary, ordinary language is confined to that incompleteness with its standard lexicon that would claim to enclose reality within a net of pre-established recurrences.

As a means of addressing this question, this essay analyzes the relationship of important poems to their source text, foregrounding Bartolomeo Ricci\u2019s concepts of sequi, imitare, and aemulare, presented in the 1541 De imitatione. Focusing on the rich legacies of Canzone 323  (delle Visioni) by Francesco Petrarca in the poetry of (among others) Diego D\u00e1valos y Figueroa, Francisco de Quevedo, Lope de Vega, Fray Lu\u00eds de Le\u00f3n and Juan de Guevara, the essay provides a powerful explication of the generative properties of imitatio.

Yet suggestive claims have been made that Rvf 189 was also rendered by Chaucer as Troilus' second canticus in book V, within a context inclusive of additional Petrarchan influences on Chaucer.  Chaucer's versions, and their contextualization in the Troilus, had definite consequences for Petrarchan translation when it resumed with the Henrician poets Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard a century and a half later. For the Tudor poets living under the tyranny of Henry VIII the Petrarch-inspired sonnet offered a richly articulated space of private reflection that did not fail to register the pressure of court politics. Wyatt's Petrarchan translations in the Egerton manuscript represent a privileged part of his lyric production, a preference that the Earl of Surrey absorbed for his very different poetic program, one designed to exalt both aristocratic lineage and an aureate genealogy of poets including Virgil, Dante, and Chaucer along with Petrarch and Wyatt. Mediated by multiple editions of Tottel's Songs and Sonnettes between 1557 and 1594, the legacy of Wyatt's and Surrey's Petrarchan translations reached the Elizabethans with an emphasis on Petrarch's poetic supremacy that stimulated emulation by the young Shakespeare. His tragedy Romeo and Juliet threw down a challenge to Petrarch with respect to sonnet forms, sonnet rhetoric, and the typical story of enamorment, a story still discernibly affiliated with Chaucer's .", "article_title": "Francis, Thou Art Translated: Petrarch Metamorphosed in English, 1380-1595", "authors": [{"given": "Ronald L.", "family": "Martinez", "affiliation": {"original_name": "Brown University", "normalized_name": "Brown University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gq02987", "GRID": "grid.40263.33"}}}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2011-06-29", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5399/uo/hsda.1.1.1101", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.5399/uo/hsda.1.1.1101", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "This article examines the theoretical premises and consequences of the renewed attention to the intersection between philology, hermeneutics, and criticism in humanist studies in general and in Petrarch studies in particular.
