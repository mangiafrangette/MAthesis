The fact that this extra metadata has to be encoded in formal terms in order to be processed by computers has forced us to reflect on issues that are usually overlooked or, at least, not actively discussed and documented: How do I record which document is a translation of which? How do I record that this document is a translation of that specific revision of another document? And what if a certain translation has been created using one or more intermediate translations with no access to the original document? In this paper we addresses all these issues, starting from first principles and incrementally building towards a comprehensive solution. This solution is then distilled in terms of formal concepts (e.g., translation, abstraction levels, comparability, division in parts, addressability) and abstract data structures (e.g., derivation graphs, revisions-alignment tables, source-document tables, source-part tables). The proposed data structures can be seen as a generalization of the classical evolutionary trees (e.g., stemma codicum), extended to take into account the concepts of translation and contamination (i.e., multiple sources).
