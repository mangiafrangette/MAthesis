This paper discusses and reviews many of the influential ideas and representative achievements that were reported in the Series on Digital Humanities and the International Conference on Digital Archives and Digital Humanities. Existing accomplishments have provided not only substantial proofs for the far-reaching promises of Digital Humanities but also further guidance for advancing the field in coming years. The increasing availability of research material and the strengthening power of computing facilities are leading us to a new era of humanistic research. In an open data environment, researchers may access information that are potentially relevant to their research targets from diverse sources with the help of information retrieval and extraction techniques. Digital tools for relating and disambiguating relevant information from abundant raw material can assist researchers to sift through documents that offer insights of varying relevancy. With the solid foundations of the availability of research data and the strength of computing supports, researchers can dig deeply into a research topic. In addition, digital tools may provide explorative search, offering opportunities of discovering new issues that are contextually related to the original research topic. With an appropriate expert-in-the- loop search mechanism, experts may uncover new research topics and may even link relationships between topics that were not previously known, perhaps forming a topic network among research topics. A truly open data environment also allows us to make results of humanistic research verifiable. Readers of a published paper may find and study both the cited papers and the researched material via information curators or data providers so that readers may acquire a deeper understanding of the viewpoints and thoughts of the paper authors.

This is often not sufficient for humanists who want to employ digital tools to explore properties from interesting subsets of the library or system. Humanists usually do not merely rely on the libraries or systems. They keep interesting texts in hard disks accessible for themselves. It can be hard with conventional systems to analyze properties of texts stored in personal computers. To fix this problem, it is desirable to have a platform that allows one to build personal databases that support not only common retrieval functions but also text-analytic ones. In this paper, we propose DocuSky to solve this problem. DocuSky allows a user to upload text contents to build his or her personal databass. It supports fulltext retrieval, post-classification over a search result, as well as analysis on tagged terms. Fulltext retrieval is common for searching desirable documents in a database. For any search result, post-classification groups its metadata and shows the resulting distribution. Analysis on tagged terms, on the other hand, returns a list of tagged terms occurring in that search result. They are the three major functions offered by the well-known Taiwan History Digital Library (THDL) system. In addition to these elementary functions, it also provides a couple of tools to help users analyze the contents in a database. The advance of digital humanities requires closely cooperation of computer engineers and digital humanists.

Almost all the poems written with the incentive process are composed of two couplets: the first, called initiative lines (q\u01d0j\u00f9 \u8d77\u53e5), evokes an affective image; and the second, called envoi lines (y\u00ecngj\u00f9 \u61c9\u53e5), expresses one's feeling. Nevertheless, the semantic correlation between two couplets is often ambiguous. In the Mao version, the use of the incentive process is marked with two Chinese characters x\u012bng y\u011b \u8208\u4e5f where one couplet ends and the following begins. Without this mark, it is difficult to recognize this literary form. To interpret the semantic correlation between these lines in macrostructure, traditional commentaries proceed by analogical comparison, causal reasoning, or arrangement of events in sequence. Some recent studies suggest focusing on the microstructure of the incentive process, for example, rhyme schemes, syntactical relations, reiterated formulas, or alternation between function words and content words. The criteria for identifying the incentive process is problematic since his first appearance in the history of Chinese literary theory. However, this process has been considered as the archetypal form in Chinese lyric tradition for a long period. Based on the internal textual data retrieved from the corpus, this work discovers by combinatorial analysis all underlying patterns in all verses and determines representatives patterns as rhythmic patterns according to the frequency of occurrence. Finally, by linking defined rhythmic patterns between lines, this work re-describes stylistic devices of poems written with the incentive process.", "article_title": "A Quantitative Research of the Book of Odes (Sh\u012bj\u012bng \u8a69\u7d93): The Discovery of the Underlying Rhythm in the Incentive Process", "authors": [{"given": "Shueh-Ying", "family": "Liao", "affiliation": null}], "publisher": "\u81fa\u7063\u6578\u4f4d\u4eba\u6587\u5b78\u6703 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2019-10-01", "keywords": ["digital humanities ", " quantitative analysis ", " rhythmic analysis ", " Book of Odes(Sh\u012bj\u012bng \u8a69\u7d93) ", " incentive process(x\u012bng \u8208)"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "4", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.6853/DADH.201910_(4).0002", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.6853/DADH.201910_(4).0002", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "Topic modeling is a digital method to discover hidden thematic structure in large collections of unlabeled texts.

Considering the actual needs of historical event research, this study starts with the needs of individual researchers and designs a set of tools for historical text event analysis, and the effectiveness of the method is further evaluated by applying it to study pirate events in the Ming Dynasty. Since pirates continued to invade China's coastal areas almost throughout the Ming Dynasty, the Maritime Prohibition Policy and coastal defense arrangements in the Ming Dynasty closely related to the growth and decline of pirates' scourge. Based on some research papers and historical document text on the theme of Chinese coastal pirates, we identify and derive event groups through the individual-use text-based historical event analysis tool, and establish a data structure that links historical events, people and place names. By analyzing the type of each pirate event group, we found that it includes war cases and coastal defense affairs, and we can further track their spatiotemporal transition characteristics by name entities in each event group.
