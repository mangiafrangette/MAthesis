If the type of nationalism that the Armagnacs represented possesses any didactic force today, it is as a negative exemplum. Based on contemporary chronicle representations of the faction revealing how it understood itself and how it was viewed by its enemies, I argue that the Armagnacs are better seen as members of a feuding faction than as early nationalists to conclude that recent debate over national identity would be well served by acknowledging from the outset the fictive nature of what the History of France relates about the trajectory towards national unity and the perennial disagreement over who is French and who is not.", "article_title": "Feuding, Factionalism and Fictions of National Identity: Reconsidering Charles VII\u2019s Armagnacs", "authors": [{"given": "Tracy", "family": "Adams", "affiliation": ["University of Auckland", "The Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies"]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2012-07-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/dph.2012.0008", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.1353/dph.2012.0008", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "This article offers a codicological description of the most complete extant manuscript containing the poetry of Ausi\u00e0s March (Valencia, 1400\u20131459).

Increasingly diverse ethnicity in nation states alters the status of once dominant vernaculars\u2014what Dante called the parlar materno\u2014as factors of cultural and social cohesion. Language and religion, rather than nation, now serve as elective markers of identity. Inevitably, however, to assert global status for a language conveys overtones of linguistic, and thus cultural, hegemony. From this perspective, Carl Schmitt\u2019s dictum that \u201call significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts,\u201d resonates in the sphere of language. For when Schmitt refers to modern concepts of state as theological in origin, his thought speaks directly to the concept of global language. For \u201cglobal\u201d is only a slightly attenuated variant of \u201cuniversal,\u201d whose totalizing connotation we find somewhat embarrassing today. And yet, historically, the myth of a lost universal language has played an important role in traditional cultures that value creation accounts. The latter evoke a mythic moment, in illo tempore, when all humans spoke a common language for the simple reason that the origin of the one implicated the emergence of the other. Perhaps no one thought so profoundly about the question of global or universal language in this sense as Dante Alighieri in his philosophical treatise on the illustrious vernacular, the De vulgari eloquentia (c. 1304 CE, DVE). Unlike proponents of global language today who seek to extrapolate a (pre)dominant language from among hundreds of dialects, Dante recognized multilingualism as an historical contingency, a product of the linguistic fall at Babel. At that point, universal language\u2014the speech co-created by God and the first man in Genesis\u2014disappeared, fractured into linguistic shards representing the diversity of human culture. Dante\u2019s anthropology of language thus imitates the division of the first human into an infinite series, each unit different from others, but all containing an originary \u201cDNA,\u201d identified in Genesis 1:26\u201327 as divine similitude. Likewise, Dante proposes that all human language possess a common \u201cdeep structure,\u201d a set of principles for a universal grammar that act as the formal cause of language. Dante calls this capacity for language the forma locutionis, the innate capacity for speech, which defines humans. For Dante, only the vernacular or mother tongue can embody this essence. Jointly created by God and the first man, it has the potential to incarnate the highest aspiration of human speech, the volgare illustre or illustrious vernacular. Although Dante lays out his anthropology of the vernacular in De vulgare eloquentia\u2014arguing that one must look to the most refined vernacular poetry for examples\u2014he defers demonstrating the concept fully until Purgatorio and Paradiso. There he deploys text networks invoking Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and diverse vernacular poets and philosophers to showcase the volgare illustre as a universal vernacular\u2014a forma locutionis in which the meaning, aura, and affect of speaking take precedence over language of origin.", "article_title": "Global Language or Universal Language?: From Babel to the Illustrious Vernacular", "authors": [{"given": "Stephen G.", "family": "Nichols", "affiliation": ["Johns Hopkins University"]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2012-07-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/dph.2012.0002", "identifier": {"string_id": "10.1353/dph.2012.0002", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "In the digital humanities much research has been done concerning stylometry, the computational study of style.

Common practice dictates that behind every text, a patron-figure looms, typically identified as a member of nobility for whom the text was composed. Many medieval texts promote this view by spotlighting extratextual relations in dedication materials or by folding into the narrative itself the story of its inception. Regardless of the source of these narratives, scholarship places under the patronage umbrella a large spectrum of exchanges said to have fostered the literary enterprise while excluding other partnerships that are seen to destabilize the system. Thus, transactions as distinctive as Guillaume de Machaut\u2019s Confort d\u2019amy, presented as an unsolicited text intended to comfort the imprisoned Charles of Navarre; Jean Froissart\u2019s fictive account of literary collaboration with a prince in the Prison amoureuse; Christine de Pizan\u2019s biography of Charles V, identified in the prologue as a commission ordered by the duke of Burgundy; and Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s dedication of Troilus and Criseyde to fellow poet John Gower and the lawyer Ralph Strode are presented as forms of patronage with little thought to the implications of the relational variations. At the same time, a number of transactions are sidelined in patronage studies because they seem to transgress the boundaries of expected exchange, even though they reproduce many of the same dynamics; hence, regifting, seizure of books, multi-copy dissemination of a single work, and purchase of a book from a third party regularly fail to figure into analysis. To date, scholars have avoided interrogating these arbitrary boundaries that define patronage studies.

By presenting a case study devoted to the figure of Moss\u00e8n Aviny\u00f3, a fifteenth-century Catalan nobleman and poet, the authors of this essay exemplify the need for a rigorous perusal of the material evidence that is being archived in digital projects. With paleographical, codicological, and literary evidence, the authors show with great probability that Aviny\u00f3 himself compiled two manuscripts currently held by the Hispanic Society of America: the Cancionero de Vindel and the Can\u00e7oner llemos\u00ed del siglo XV. In doing so, the authors also show that these two manuscripts contain the entirety of Aviny\u00f3\u2019s lyric production, along with a sampling of the poetry produced by those who traveled in Aviny\u00f3\u2019s cultural circles.", "article_title": "Moss\u00e8n Aviny\u00f3, the Cancionero de Vindel and the Can\u00e7oner llemos\u00ed del siglo XV", "authors": [{"given": "Rafael", "family": "Ramos", "affiliation": ["Universitat de Girona"]}, {"given": "Francisco J.

After first considering how targeted textual searching has changed the way books are used for research\u2014inverting the traditional hierarchy of text and reader by allowing the latter to use the text with greater speed and control than ever before\u2014I suggest that the change in the function of books can also entail for medievalists a change in the meaning of manuscripts.
