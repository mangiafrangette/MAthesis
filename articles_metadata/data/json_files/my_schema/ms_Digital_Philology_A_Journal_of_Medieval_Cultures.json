        "abstract": "President Nicolas Sarkozy’s recent call for a debate on national identity generated controversy in France. I use this controversy as a point of departure from which to re-examine the nineteenth-century myth of nationalism that casts the Armagnacs, supporters of Charles VII, as protonationalists. If the type of nationalism that the Armagnacs represented possesses any didactic force today, it is as a negative exemplum. Based on contemporary chronicle representations of the faction revealing how it understood itself and how it was viewed by its enemies, I argue that the Armagnacs are better seen as members of a feuding faction than as early nationalists to conclude that recent debate over national identity would be well served by acknowledging from the outset the fictive nature of what the History of France relates about the trajectory towards national unity and the perennial disagreement over who is French and who is not.",

        "abstract": "In this paper I study the portrayal of Jean de Meun in Arsenal 3339, an early fifteenth-century manuscript collection in which the Rose precedes Jean’s Testament, Codicille, and Tresor ou Sept articles de la foi. I marshal manuscript evidence to show how the person who masterminded the production of Arsenal 3339 refuted certain of the reproaches leveled against Jean de Meun in the 1401–1403 Debate about the Roman de la Rose. They were, in effect, that he had erred on key theological points and had moreover employed questionable instructional methods. Although the Arsenal mastermind, whom I provisionally identify as its compiler, objects to the way that Jean as Rose author had portrayed himself by means of a negative persona, Jean “Clopinel,” which can be roughly translated as “Jean who limps,” he nevertheless declines to join with Jean Gerson and Christine de Pizan to consign the book to the flames. I make the case that the compiler was an early fifteenth-century reader exceptionally well versed in the Rose, the Debate documents, and Gerson’s sermons, who, by expertly designing the collection, seeks to rehabilitate Jean’s professional reputation in response to criticisms lodged by his detractors in the Debate.",

Literary authorship at-tribution, especially, has been a central topic. After a brief introduction, I will discuss the enormous potential of this paradigm for medieval philology, a field that studies so many texts of unknown or disputed origin. At the same time, it will be stressed that stylometry’s application to medieval texts is currently not without problems: many attribution techniques are still controversial and do not account for the specific nature of medieval text production. Throughout this paper, I will tentatively apply two well-established attribution techniques (principal components analysis and Burrows’s Delta) to a number of case studies in Middle Dutch studies. These analyses shall be restricted to rhyme words, since these words are less likely to have been altered by scribes.",

We argue for a more virtuous circularity for attribution arguments made through the quantitative analyses of stylometry. Our study investigated temporal lexeme usage, which has been suggested as a mark of authorship style, in the corpus traditionally attributed to Chrétien de Troyes. Our analyses revealed different usage patterns for these lexemes after line 6150 of the Lancelot, possibly indicating the signature of another author in the text (traditionally presumed to be that of Godefroy de Lagny). By embracing probabilistic arguments instead of certainties, digital philology can employ stylometry to consider questions of authorship attribution for medieval texts.",

Awareness of the characteristic features of medieval textuality, exemplified through select late medieval texts, can help in developing increasingly flexible editorial models, which are more consistent with medieval reading practices than current editions. Editions, transformed from single textual occurrences into fluid, communal, and unfolding processes, can uncover a complex notion of medieval hypertextuality by linking texts, images, and tunes. They can then even trace the reception of a given text. As readers are empowered to zoom in and out specific textual components, of manuscript witnesses, of families and printed editions, digital editions can present individual witnesses alongside editorial apparatuses and thus bridge the gap between the Old and the New Philology.",

        "abstract": "This article argues that, in the Series, Thomas Hoccleve not only appeals to the system of patronage, but attempts to revise it, creating a new template for literary sponsorship and engagement based on collaboration and mutual responsibility. The process of literary production Hoccleve outlines supports a reading of patronage that is not exclusively financially-based; rather, it is flexible, less hierarchical, and demands more from the patron than Hoccleve’s previous work—and indeed the work of most medieval authors—would suggest. In order to understand Hoccleve’s attempts to redefine his relationship to the system of literary sponsorship, however, we must be willing to take the structure of the Series seriously, following the signposts of creative collaboration Hoccleve weaves throughout the texts rather than their misleading, seemingly random nature. In addition to offering an alternate reading of Hoccleve’s work in the Series, this article suggests new ways of thinking about literary patronage in the Middle Ages more generally.",

        "abstract": "Patronage regularly figures as the dominant paradigm in discussions of late-medieval literary production and circulation. Common practice dictates that behind every text, a patron-figure looms, typically identified as a member of nobility for whom the text was composed. Many medieval texts promote this view by spotlighting extratextual relations in dedication materials or by folding into the narrative itself the story of its inception. Regardless of the source of these narratives, scholarship places under the patronage umbrella a large spectrum of exchanges said to have fostered the literary enterprise while excluding other partnerships that are seen to destabilize the system. Thus, transactions as distinctive as Guillaume de Machaut’s Confort d’amy, presented as an unsolicited text intended to comfort the imprisoned Charles of Navarre; Jean Froissart’s fictive account of literary collaboration with a prince in the Prison amoureuse; Christine de Pizan’s biography of Charles V, identified in the prologue as a commission ordered by the duke of Burgundy; and Geoffrey Chaucer’s dedication of Troilus and Criseyde to fellow poet John Gower and the lawyer Ralph Strode are presented as forms of patronage with little thought to the implications of the relational variations. At the same time, a number of transactions are sidelined in patronage studies because they seem to transgress the boundaries of expected exchange, even though they reproduce many of the same dynamics; hence, regifting, seizure of books, multi-copy dissemination of a single work, and purchase of a book from a third party regularly fail to figure into analysis. To date, scholars have avoided interrogating these arbitrary boundaries that define patronage studies. Critical avoidance of the heterogeneity of literary support networks is further exacerbated by a generalized failure to interrogate the impact of time, place, or cultural practices on sponsorship, not to mention possible manipulations of this exchange based on political, economic or personal concerns.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews the terminological framework used to describe manuscripts. The Lachmannian terminology allows scholars to classify manuscripts as versions or variants of a work on a purely textual basis, but lacks a rigid designator to indicate a (part of a) manuscript as a unit of text and material considerations. Conversely, scholars who adopt Dagenais’s solution to renounce the work and concentrate on the material scriptum gain a rigid designator, but threaten to lose the ability to classify manuscripts at all. Proceeding from a case study, the article argues that the twelfth-century view of a work’s ontological status enables medievalists to keep classifying their scripta on both textual and material grounds. It explores the possibility of using Dagenais’s scriptum as the foundation for a Neo-Lachmannian terminological framework that allows scholars to study manuscript variance and materiality without losing the ability to classify them.",

Taking literature as his starting point (often under the rubric of a concrete Ansatzpunkt, be this a phrase, an isolated feature of style, or a self-contained logical sequence), Auerbach restlessly sought to establish nothing less than an intellectual—or better yet, spiritual (he often calls it “inner”)—history of the Western European mind as it lunged into contemporary modernity. Literary forms were for Auerbach a gateway to forms of thought, feeling, and expression. Philology was the method best suited to grasping these. The result was a philology of the world (Weltphilologie)—a politically, ideologically, and ethically engaged counter-philology that is as relevant today as it was in his own lifetime.",

Her compassion was equated with the bridal and maternal Church lovingly receiving and nourishing the spirit of the Law of Moses as her groom and infant Christ. The Spanish poem parodies these meanings by portraying the relationship between the narrator and his procuress as that of a crying baby being soothed by his mother. In a subversion of the heart-rending cries of Moses being consoled by the Church, the old bawd enables him to seduce the object of his lust by perversely appealing to her maternal compassion.",

This essay takes as its starting point the changes in the nature of printed books that have come about in the last decade with the dramatic increase in data storage and retrieval capabilities, paying particular attention to the impact of book digitization by Google Books and similar programs. After first considering how targeted textual searching has changed the way books are used for research—inverting the traditional hierarchy of text and reader by allowing the latter to use the text with greater speed and control than ever before—I suggest that the change in the function of books can also entail for medievalists a change in the meaning of manuscripts. Because manuscripts provide much more information than that which is encoded in their text, including many elements that defy systematic characterization, their idiosyncratic nature seems to be enhanced in comparison to the increasingly utilitarian nature of searchable books. Taking as an exemplary case the digitization of University of Coimbra MS 720, a late-medieval copy of the Dagger of Faith (Pugio fidei) by the Catalan Dominican Ramon Martí, this essay offers some personal reflections on the ways that the use of texts, information, and manuscripts is changing in the age of digital books.",

Secondly, through the former discussion we bring forth three main questions for the study of medieval translation in general, namely: autor-ship, mediation, and transmission. The third question elicits our philological discussion of what constitutes a translation and how we may distinguish different translations or versions of a same work.",

I highlight the complexities of transmission with an example of how one late medieval reader responded not to the text at hand, but rather to his memories or expectations of other histories and other texts.",

Finally, the author compares the competently written Dartmouth manuscript with one of the physically sloppiest of all Brut manuscripts—Glasgow MS Hunter 443. These manuscripts provide useful foils to each other when examined against the large body of Brut manuscripts, illuminating the different methods available to fifteenth-century scribes.",

The stories of Constantine and Havelok would have been offensive to some since the first suggests a continuation of heroic kingship among the Welsh and the second an unflattering parallel to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who was attempting to control the government of the child-king Henry VI.",

        "abstract": "Erich Auerbach’s Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1946) was profoundly influenced by George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s idealist philosophy. Hegel held that concepts determine the structure of reality: the concept of freedom in his philosophy of history and, for Auerbach, the concept of history in the representation of reality. For both, reality is inextricable from reason, rationality, consciousness, and vice versa; hence, history signifies the rise and progress of human consciousness. Auerbach also shared Hegel’s view that the art of mimesis produces an image of a reality, in contrast to Plato, who thought a work of art is a resemblance opposed to reality. This paper analyzes the influence of Hegel’s philosophy of history on Auerbach’s conceptions of literary history, reality, and truth, as evidenced in Mimesis’s famous first chapter, “Odysseus’ Scar.” Auerbach chose the Hegelian concept of reality (Wirklichkeit) as the subtitle of his book to advance its main thesis, opposing realism to myths and legends, rationality to the flight from reason. He refutes the claim that classical Greek myths, legends, and heroes inaugurated Western culture’s representation of reality and, hence, conception of history. Instead, he finds their origins in the Old Testament, with its formulation of world, universal history, and “concept of the historically becoming,” an important Hegelian concept according to which the temporal becoming and unfolding of the life of human beings is meaningful, intelligible, and should be thought of as evolutionary progress toward a certain goal or end.",

Part III studies the theories of narration implied by scribal annotations in some medieval manuscripts.

        "abstract": "Resistance to digital technology in manuscript study stems in large part from what detractors perceive as a loss of contact with the material artifact. For them, the digital image represents an illegitimate substitution for “the real thing.” In two movements, this article first suggests why such a term radically misunderstands both the relationship of digital image to manuscript, and also the nature of the manuscript’s performance of the work it represents. A second movement illustrates the performative propensity of manuscript technology—under the impetus of the sudden accumulation of vernacular adaptations of classical works fostered by Charles V in the 1370s—to influence court culture.",

In light of new tools and practices within the digital humanities, the author suggests that the number of previously differentiated scribes writing between folios 16v–28r ought to be reduced. Fleck examines Corpus Christi’s digital holdings through the tools afforded by Stanford University’s Parker on the Web Project, and addresses questions of scribal identity treated most recently and prominently by Janet Bately and David Dumville, collaborative editors of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. In so doing, he demonstrates the utility of these digital tools for democratizing the practice of paleography.",

The manuscripts are Oxford, Bodleian Library MSS Bodley 340 and 342, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College MSS 162, 198, and 303. They date from Ælfric’s lifetime (c. 950–c. 1010) to the mid-twelfth century. I focus on three Ælfrician homilies that appear in sequence uniquely in this cluster alongside four anonymous texts that, similarly, are not found together elsewhere.

With declarations of unknowing as a case study, this paper proposes a network model for visualizing the relationship between motifs, texts, and traditional associations within the larger expressive economy of oral-traditional Old English poetics.",

Many of the texts, including Machaut’s poem, appear in the compendium in anonymous and abridged versions that erase details pertaining to a specific author or patron. The systematic process of adaptation within the manuscript favors author anonymity and a more personalized approach to abstracting meaning from texts.

        "abstract": "The ordering of polyphonic musical works in the Machaut manuscripts relates directly to issues of layout and readability. Considering the size of the manuscripts, calculated according to surface area, the paper compares musical layout across the six Machaut manuscripts including his musical works (Paris, BnF, fr. 1584, 1585, 1586, 9221, 22545–6, and the Ferrell manuscript). Focusing on BnF fr. 9221, which is the largest and latest of these manuscripts, and is often criticized for its musical readings, the paper examines the idea of authority and considers the value of the manuscript to its original owner, the Duke of Berry.",

        "abstract": "Medieval scribes used decorated letters to mark the beginnings of songs, highlighting the incipits of texted voices and the vocal designations of others (“Tenor”). But some motets from fourteenth-century France begin with sung, untexted fanfares. This study examines several instances in the Machaut and Ivrea manuscripts where shortages of space, missing opening letters, and unorthodox layout decisions point to scribal confusion in the face of such beginnings. This evidence raises the possibility that untexted introductory sections may have traveled independently of their host compositions, and suggests new answers to the problems these “introitus” sections raise for modern editors and performers.",

It perceives narratorial activity as a function that, far from being proper to one party (“the narrator”), is inherently mobile, circulating around elements of a poem or miniature, whether human characters, animals or landscape features. Miniatures devised for the jugement poems are a particularly rich resource for analyzing this mobility being exploited by artists to draw attention to issues of narrative framing, communication and point of view – including, crucially, the point of view of the manuscript’s reader/viewer.",

This study first considers Guillaume’s disgruntled reader in the Jugement dou roy de Navarre before turning to later readers who reenacted her desires when dealing with Machaut’s manuscripts. Finally, nuancing complaints that digitization distances us from the manuscript artifact, I consider how the digital surrogate reignites a desire for the textual body that defined the late-medieval reading experience.",
