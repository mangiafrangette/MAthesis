        "abstract": " In this paper, I extend theoretical understandings of the gaming activity and literary form called the quest and its relationship to issues of interpretation, focusing primarily on game theory with concrete examples as well as some broadly applicable pedagogical uses of these ideas in literature classrooms. The argument contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of quests by scholars of games studies such as Aarseth 2004, Juul 2005, Tosca 2003, and Tronstad 2001. I build upon and revise these theorists’ understandings by approaching a “quest” as a goal-oriented activity in which players undertake a journey in search of meaning. By demonstrating similarities between the literary traditions in which quests are central and the practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can be better understood theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if meaning and action are regarded as complementary design principles instead of conflicting impulses. A revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between games and narratives by showing strategies by which game designers have created meaningful action, often in ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired by the literary traditions of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game designers can use level design to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic implications, in the tradition of literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are coordinated with significant obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between meaning and action can be resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to enact a range of thematic ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a digital game. I also suggest ways in which this understanding of quests can allow literature teachers to plan assignments where students transform literary narratives into interpretative quests taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic example, I describe one such assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 into design documents and prototypes, and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other instructors. By adapting works of literature into quests, students learn to discover and create meaning through the active exertion of cognitive and imaginative effort rather than absorbing it passively.  ",

        "abstract": " Lincoln/Net (http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu), a product of the Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project at Northern Illinois University Libraries, represents a new type of historically oriented digital library resource. Like many other digital libraries, it contains a large amount of searchable primary source materials. Like a number of other historically oriented online resources, project staff have organized Lincoln/Net around a specific topic, in this case Abraham Lincoln’s life and times in antebellum Illinois. In addition to Lincoln’s own papers, the project’s databases contain resources shedding light on his context, including letters, diaries, and publications prepared by his peers. Unlike most historically oriented digital libraries however, the project Web site also includes a wealth of multimedia materials, including image, sound, video, and interactive map resources. But Lincoln/Net is perhaps most unique in that it furnishes its users with an extensive set of interpretive materials. This approach suggests that historians may play an expanding role in the development of digital libraries. It can also provide them with a badly-needed means of communicating with an audience beyond their own scholarly community and students. This communication can facilitate what one digital history pioneer has described as the democratization of history, as defined by an expanded user group enjoying primary source materials and using them to engage in historical thinking .

Recent efforts to digitize materials from this textual tradition offer opportunities to broaden the circulation of rare materials to the exiled Tibetan scholarly community, but also suggest conceptual challenges arising from the complexity of the texts and their inherently multimodal character.

        "abstract": " Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers in order to broaden the appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the Oulipo. Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts provide for their own interpretation: they are not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning. ",

        "abstract": " Because so little primary historical work has been done on the classic text computer game Colossal Cave Adventure, academic and popular references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. Adventure was the first in a series of text-based games (interactive fiction) that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for narrative encounters  and as an aesthetic masterpiece of logic and utility ; however, previous attempts to assess the significance of Adventure remain incomplete without access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave. Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther, Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory). Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to improve the gameplay. ",

Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature. Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, All Hope Abandon, explores aspects of Biblical Studies through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several examples from All Hope Abandon will be given, and instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end. ",

        "abstract": " The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history. But the popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary theories deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of texts to disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can reveal about meanings and style. The recent resurgence of interest in scholarly editions, corpora, text- analysis, stylistics, and authorship suggest that the electronic text may finally reach its full potential. ",

Individual visual experts (like connoisseurs) do not share some grand and undividable cognitive cataloguing system; they are attentive to piecemeal visual discernments and the patterns in which these occur in reality. In conventional scholarly communication sophisticated tools to discuss perceptual patterns are lacking. This paper not only proposes a theoretical model of visual knowledge accumulation, but also describes a practical implementation, Art.Similarities, which is designed as a prototype of such a sophisticated tool. Using a custom-made interface it records visual behavior: the non-verbally expressed visual similarity judgments of distributed individuals. Users can be assigned to groups according to the qualities of their judgments. These qualities may be distilled from emerging similarity patterns. The implications of individual judgments in different user groups may vary considerably. Emerging patterns can be assessed both according to human analysis and statistical procedures. Most studies on art evaluation are attentive to either the characteristics of works, or the characteristics of observers. In this study both are considered as interdependent entities consistently.

        "abstract": " The Web, though full of historical information, lacks a means of organizing that information, searching on it or visualizing it. The Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) was begun six years ago to explore how disparate historical materials on the Internet can be navigated and visualized, and for the past four years has used an XML data format defined in W3C Schemas. This format aims for conforming data that can be quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which to search for historical materials. While the project's graphical visualizations are in some respects successful, they have revealed some deficiencies in the underlying data format: it ought to provide for nested events, it ought to represent relations of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these improvements. Moreover, an RDF-encoded Heml process provides easier access to CIDOC-CRM data into Heml events. Finally, a historical RDF language would simplify the discovery of references to historical events in digitized texts, thereby automating a growing network of historical information on the Web. ",

        "abstract": " Incunabula, or books printed before 1500, are extremely difficult and expensive to convert to digital form. The primary challenges arise from the use of non-standard typographical glyphs based on medieval handwriting to abbreviate words. Further difficulties are also posed by the practice of inconsistently marking word breaks at the end of lines and reducing or even eliminating spacing between some words. As such, these documents form a distinct genre of electronic document that poses unique challenges for conversion to digital form. From 2005–2007, the Preservation and Access Research and Development Program at the National Endowment for the Humanities funded a study to explore methods for digitizing these difficult texts. This paper describes some of the results of that project. The work described in this paper was completed by the Approaching the Problems of Digitizing Latin Incunables project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Division of Preservation and Access. The material in this paper is drawn from the project application, internal technical reports, grant project reports and the project descriptions included in  and . Much of this work was inspired by Ross Scaife and his work building a corpora of Latin Colloquia. I am deeply grateful for Ross's comments, advice and support. A version of this paper will also be published as part of the project web site. ",

We demonstrate how such a digital criticism would differ from the traditional textual criticism as practiced for editions in print and suggest how a digital criticism might open new avenues for the interpretation of the poetry. In defining our needs and goals for a digital edition, we discuss what our project has in common with other digital editions of literary works, but how the oral, traditional nature of the poetry creates special requirements as well. In addition to elaborating the editorial approach for the project, we reaffirm the principles of collaboration, international standards, and open access that we have learned from Ross Scaife, the founder of the Stoa Consortium.

Many epigraphists in the last 20 years have been investigating how to use digital technology to advance their research, but until the present decade, these undertakings were restrained by aspects of the technology. The late 1990s will be seen as a watershed moment in the transition from print-based to born-digital epigraphic publication. At present, the majority of new editions are still published solely in print, but by 2017 we believe this circumstance will change drastically. The history of epigraphy makes it quite clear that such transitions are natural to the discipline. ",

        "abstract": " We describe two different strategies for generating the morphology of Latin verbs. First, we hand-code default inheritance hierarchies in the KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponents as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word  forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems. The high degree of similarity among verbs of different conjugation classes allows us to formulate general rules; these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by conjugation-specific rules. This approach allows linguists to gain an appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for generating forms of any verb. Second, we start with a paradigm chart, then automatically remove common parts and redundant morphosyntactic property sets (columns), combine similar conjugations (rows), and generate the KATR theory that produces a complete table of forms for a set of lexemes. This second approach automatically determines principal parts (for Latin, we verify that there are four), groups inflection classes into super-classes, and builds full paradigm charts.  ",

        "abstract": " The word finish can mean two things that have quite different implications for large-scale humanities computing projects: to bring to completion; to make or perform completely; to complete and also to perfect finally or in detail; to put the final and completing touches to (a thing). The word finish is just not part of the deal for the Linguistic Atlas Project in either sense.  However, granting agencies must ask what do you want money for this time? and, from this viewpoint, the Atlas Project consists of a series of particular tasks or experiments, each one of which is capable of being finished in both senses of the word. This paper discusses the reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate to the sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. There are no once-and-done, permanent solutions.  The largest humanities computing projects require continuing care and maintenance, and the best way forward is to create some sort of stable institutional setting for large projects that will provide continuity and baseline resources for the work.

        "abstract": " Since the early 1990s, theorizing in the digital humanities has often celebrated open-endedness and incompletion as inherent qualities of digital work. But a scholarly publisher undertaking preparation and sale of digital objects cannot altogether dispense with traditional notions of deadlines and completion if those publications are to enter the dual marketplaces of peer review and institutional purchase. The Electronic Imprint of the University of Virginia Press was funded in 2001 with the goal of bringing born-digital scholarly projects under the aegis of the same review and marketing system that applies to books. In this article I describe how we defined the criteria for done-ness in creating two very different projects, a born-digital edition of Herman Melville’s Typee manuscript and a conversion of the letterpress Papers of George Washington into a digital edition. Our experience suggests that it is possible to categorize different genres of digital creations based on the extent to which intrinsic criteria for “done-ness” can be applied to them, and that decisions about completeness are always subject to extrinsic factors as well, such as budgetary constraints and the pressures created by competition and the evolution of standards.

The idea of doneness circulates discursively within a complex and evolving scholarly ecology where new modes of digital publication are changing our conceptions of textuality, at the same time that models of publication, funding, and archiving are rapidly changing. Within this ecology, it is instrumental and indeed valuable to consider particular tasks and stages done, even as the capacities of digital media push against a sense of finality. However, careful interrogation of aims and ends is required to think through the relation of a digital project to completion, whether modular, provisional, or of the project as a whole. ",

The sets of words that were most useful in distinguishing male and female writing are extracted from the support vectors. The results reinforce previous findings from statistical analyses of the same corpus, and exhibit remarkable cross-linguistic parallels with the results garnered from SVM models trained in gender classification on selections from the British National Corpus. It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for determiners and numerical quantifiers. Among the words that characterize male or female writing consistently over the time period spanned by the corpus, a number of cohesive semantic groups are identified. Male authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church, while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality. Such differences would take an enormous human effort to discover by a close reading of such a large corpus, but once identified through text mining, they frame intriguing questions which scholars may address using traditional critical analysis methods.

        "abstract": " Machine learning and text mining offer new models for text analysis in the humanities by searching for meaningful patterns across many hundreds or thousands of documents. In this study, we apply comparative text mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We first run tests on the plays of American versus non-American playwrights using a variety of learning techniques to classify these works, identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features which distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of performance in this cross-classification task and find features that may provide interpretative insights. Turning our attention to the question of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors as well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again achieve significant results which provide a variety of feature lists clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made by male and female playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and may be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most successful classifications for author and character genders were accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways. Doing so creates a kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit the interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the classification tasks as binary oppositions (male/female, etc), the possibility arises of stereotypical or lowest common denominator results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of textual and literary research by looking for patterns in large collections of documents, but should be employed with close attention to its methodological and critical limitations.

        "abstract": " The Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert was one of the most important and revolutionary intellectual products of the French Enlightenment. Mobilizing many of the great – and the not-so-great – philosophes of the 18th century, the Encyclopédie was a massive reference work for the arts and sciences, which sought to organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while at the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it is a highly structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for experiments with supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train a Naive Bayesian classifier on the labeled articles and use this model to determine class membership for the remaining articles. This model is then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in terms of class distinction. Re-applying the model onto the original classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists. Finally, by applying this model to another corpus from 18th century France, the Journal de Trévoux, or Mémoires pour l'Histoire des Sciences & des Beaux-Arts, new light is shed on the domain of Literature as it was understood and defined by 18th century writers.

The field of electronic literature is based on a gift economy and developing a  network-based literary culture built on the collaborative practices of a globally distributed community of artists, writers, and scholars.

        "abstract": " The nature of the academic lecture has changed with the introduction of wi-fi and cellular technologies. Interacting with personal screens during a lecture or other live event has become commonplace and, as a result, the economy of attention that defines these situations has changed. Is it possible to pay attention when sending a text message or surfing the web? For that matter, does distraction always detract from the learning that takes place in these environments? In this article, we ask questions concerning the texture and shape of this emerging economy of attention. We do not take a position on the efficiency of new technologies for delivering educational content or their efficacy of competing for users’ time and attention. Instead, we argue that the emerging social media provide new methods for choreographing attention in line with the performative conventions of any given situation. Rather than banning laptops and phones from the lecture hall and the classroom, we aim to ask what precisely they have on offer for these settings understood as performative sites, as well as for a culture that equates individual attentional behavior with intellectual and moral aptitude.

One may speak of end as in the supersession of one model of editing (the intentionalist, definitive-text model) by another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned views enabled by digital methods). One may speak of end as in aim: not only the aim of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors. These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States. The essay concludes that a huge shift is indeed underway in the editing world, towards a more open and participatory model of editing and reading. ",

In the 1990s, as humanists began to sense the advantages of networked computing on the web, they conceived major new editorial projects that would depend to an extraordinary degree upon the documentary power of pictures. Despite evident progress in devising sturdy and responsive standards, images, and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes them available for manipulation by its users. Editing electronic images in so unsettled and unsettling an environment generates the provisional success — weak success — that is utterly characteristic of X-editing, electronic scholarly editing in our time.  Our dependence on current technology and the expertise of others is not a remediable condition. We must play the game as it presents itself, making the compromises that are necessary, and move ahead.

        "abstract": " This article presents the results of a semester-long project designed to determine how effectively interactive Web 2.0 technology can facilitate collaborative research in undergraduate learners. The study was conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course at the University of Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative, inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeare’s works developed an implicit awareness of motives for doing history. We also show how employing open source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and students’ experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the humanities’ disengagement from the real world that many have been suggesting of late. ",

While it now plays a critical role in the infrastructure of many digital library operations, XML's promise of interoperability of data across systems and organizations has not been fully realized within digital libraries. The reasons for this are not primarily technical in origin, but social, and relate to the cultures of XML's designers and XML language implementors, and a failure on the part of the digital library community to grapple with the sociotechnical nature of XML and its implementation. Possible strategies for addressing these issues of interoperability might include reduction of the flexibility afforded by specific XML-based markup languages used by the digital library community, and an increased focus on standardizing translations between various communities of practice use of such markup languages.

It is argued that this renaming of humanities computing as digital humanities carries with it a set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily compatible with a broad and inclusive notion of the digital humanities. In particular, the author suggests that tensions arise from the instrumental, textual and methodological focus of humanities computing as well as its relative lack of engagement with the digital as a study object. This article is the first in a series of four articles attempting to describe and analyze the field of digital humanities and digital humanities as a transformative practice. ",

        "abstract": " This article offers an analysis of the video game in terms of the experience of gameplay, starting with the concept of the avatar, which is central to all video games. The avatar is typically described as our second self in the virtual world of the game. The paper challenges this theory, suggesting that the avatar is better understood as a set of possible interactions, and proposes a second concept, the avatari. If the avatar is our second self, the avatari is the rebellious figure on the screen that we cannot quite control, and that jumps into the pit, gets hit by the enemy, or otherwise fails despite our best efforts to succeed. Conceptualizing video games in terms of the avatar and avatari enables thinking about video games via a more sophisticated and productive model of interactivity than many of the existing paradigms.

The trained droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is to encapsulate the results of the software training phase. They can be saved for future re-use against other collections or combinations of collections. They can be modified by having the user accept or reject features identified by the data mining software. Finally, they can also contain choices for how to display and organize items in the collection. The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents the designer with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good for and how it is used. This paper outlines the design process we followed in creating the visual representations of these interface objects, describes the communicative strengths and weaknesses of a number of alternative designs, and discusses the importance of the study of new interface objects as the means of providing the user with new interface affordances.

        "abstract": " In this article, we evaluate approaches using logic reasoning applied to an ontology for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario. Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning. At the moment, to the author’s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in literature studies, have been published. Existing approaches show promising results in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies. ",

        "abstract": " Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology. The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. Computation is here broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression. The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.

Little application has been made of the processing power of grid technologies to humanities data, due to lack of available large-scale datasets, and little understanding of or access to e-Science technologies. The Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) scoping study, an AHRC-funded e-science workshop series, was established to investigate the potential application of grid computing to a large dataset of interest to historians, humanists, digital consumers, and the general public: historical census records. Consisting of three one-day workshops held at UCL in Summer 2006, the workshop series brought together expertise across different domains to ascertain how useful, possible, or feasible it would be to analyse datasets from Ancestry and The National Archives using the HPC facilities available at UCL. This article details the academic, technical, managerial, and legal issues highlighted in the project when attempting to apply HPC to historical data sets. Additionally, generic issues facing humanities researchers attempting to utilise HPC technologies in their research are presented.  ",

        "abstract": " Medievalists typically resort to parchment for primary research and when editing their sources. Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts copied onto animal skins may have started life in the same workshop but over the centuries have become dispersed, coming to rest in libraries all over the world; bringing these together entails travel, microfilm purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within reach of a microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution digitisation yields not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows for the development of additional research tools using image compression and manipulation, and new modes of representation, e.g. juxtaposed display of several related witnesses. This paper outlines research questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show how the viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare and annotation one or more witnesses (interactively and in real time), and for use as an integral part of an online edition. Finally, it explores how it can be deployed for use on projects taking knowledge outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public spaces. ",

        "abstract": " Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture, provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process itself. This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new kinds of computer-based research and practice in the arts and humanities. It also introduces important national initiatives in this area, such as the JISC e-Framework programme for Higher Education. ",

This essay  discusses the purpose of doing such a thing, arguing there is a distinct  method in the apparent randomness of labelling something e this or  that.  Far from simply denoting that it might be done with computers  (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect  of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an  emergent e-culture that reunites the arts and sciences after two  hundred years of separate development within the academy.  An  e-Culture emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and  restrictions of Internet as a research environment.  The potential of  that environment requires a mindset focussed on collaboration to achieve  anything of creative significance. ",

Based on the results of a study conducted by the Public Knowledge Project and introduced at Digital Humanities 2006 (Siemens, Willinsky and Blake), continued and augmented since, this paper discusses the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate students to using a set of online reading tools. The results of our study reveal both the potential strengths and perceived weaknesses of online reading environments. Understanding how users read and evaluate research materials, anticipating users’ expectations of the reading tools and resources, and addressing user concerns about the availability of online material will lead to improvements in the design and features of online publishing.

        "abstract": " This paper arises out of a brief period in the early- to mid-2000s when the British funding and research climate facilitated a relationship between the technical, operational language of e-Science and the creative and performing arts. It concerns the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and their archives, they enact the liveness of archives as they are accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A&H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how e-Science technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event.

        "abstract": " The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure — all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition.  As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are called to action with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets? ",

The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a flythrough of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue. ",

It was also the first hypertext system that beginners could use, and pioneered many modern hypertext concepts for personal use.

These encoding experiments reflect the diverse nature of the artifacts and represent a critical assessment of the effectiveness of present encoding practices for the multidimensional and pragmatic aspects of authorial drafts. Thus far, it seems that the TEI has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate practical solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our conclusion is that there is a potential conflict between the linear and hierchical nature of current formal language systems such as XML, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process. In such cases we may have to rethink present models of document modeling, and to develop, within an adequate epistemological framework, a new theory of digital text. ",

        "abstract": " While the purpose and direction of tools and tool development for the Digital Humanities have been debated in various forums, the value of tool development as a scholarly activity has seen little discussion. As a way of filling this gap, the authors conducted an online survey of developers of digital humanities tools in March 2008. The survey focused on their perceptions of their work, how they felt their tool development fit into a structure of academic rewards, and the value of tool development as a scholarly pursuit. Survey results indicate that tool development is indeed considered a scholarly activity by developers, but recognition of this work and rewards for it lag behind rewards for traditional scholarly pursuits (such as journal articles and book publication). This paper presents a summary of the results of the survey, ending with some suggestions for further research. ",

After work with community development corporations on the East Coast, Plotkin entered graduate school in urban history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. During this period in the early nineties, Plotkin had a job with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and then collaborated on the development of the forum that became H-Net. In addition to standards and protocols about new communication technologies, face-to-face relationships grew out of online exchanges, often with lively disagreements about the direction of H-Net. Plotkin’s own broadening use of digital tools prompts her concluding reflections on historians’ continuing need to use the Internet to overcome physical and intellectual fragmentation, and how the Internet has democratized the field of history.

The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) Final Report from the International Federation of Library Associations has provided the library community with a model for addressing these questions in the bibliographic systems they create. The Preserving Virtual Worlds project has been investigating FRBR's potential as a model for the description of computer games and interactive fiction. While FRBR provides an attractive theoretical model, the complexity of computer games as works makes its application to such software creations problematic in practice. ",

        "abstract": " There is currently an infrastructure turn with very real implications for the humanities and digital humanities. It comes not only with presumed technology or infrastructure, but also with certain assumptions, discursive patterns, and models. This paper analyzes these critically and advocates a humanities-based notion of cyberinfrastructure, not necessarily built on a science-and-engineering paradigm or exclusively grounded in existing humanities infrastructure. It is argued that we need to maintain a critical stance while simultaneously engaging in the exploration of research issues and technologies. There is often a gap between the material details of infrastructure and underlying, foundational ideas, and it is suggested that a model based on conceptual cyberinfrastructure and design parameters can be one way of connecting the ideational level with actual implementation. HUMlab at Umeå University serves as a case study. ",

        "abstract": " As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences. These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.

        "abstract": " This essay argues that the urban collective novel serves as an important modernist precursor to network narratives. The collective novel is a literary form, particularly popular during the 1930s, that explores a wide context through a decentered narrative. Previous discussions of these novels have focused on them as exemplars of modernist form in proletarian literature. However, this essay shows another origin for the form in concerns about the metropolis and mass culture that complicates our understanding. Drawing on examples from novels by John Dos Passos, Daniel Fuchs, Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst, William S. Rollins, Jr., and Josephine Herbst it shows how these texts offered not only radically ambivalent assessments of networked existence but often a pessimistic view of the possibilities of political community, extending at times to specific critiques of communist politics. In its conclusion, the essay draws links between these novels and the cinematic network narratives that became popular in the first decade of the 21st century. ",

        "abstract": " This article argues that Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, while it cannot be considered a text straightforwardly concerned with technology, offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the delocalized and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the network. Unlike today’s seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in Winesburg, Ohio functions as a kluge,  an ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole . Anderson’s kluge augurs network technology and therefore suggests that the form loomed large in modernists’ mind. However, Winesburg, Ohio illustrates the network’s propensity to foster users’ inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection and thereby warns against the antagonistic quality of the network’s rhizomatic structure.

        "abstract": " Wesley Beal examines John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. trilogy (1930-36) to read its complex form — what the author once referred to as a four-way conveyor system — as an intricate networking scheme, and considers it as an archive of early network thinking. Contrary to traditional readings of U.S.A. that discuss its formal properties in terms of dispersal and the supposedly ruinous disconnections of modern life, the paper argues that the interplay of these formal fragments results in a semiotic web that drives Dos Passos’s narrative strategy toward a totalizing vision of the nation and, indeed, history. Beal’s paper deals with the progressive widening of network figuration in American modernism to think the very politics of national space, and in focusing on the machinic dynamics of Dos Passos’s form, the article establishes network discourses as the organizing principle of several pre-digitization modes of production, including Fordism and the modern corporation.

        "abstract": " The Globe is All One: Wars I Have Seen as Proto-Network Narrative charts Gertrude Stein's characterization of the human mind as an data-processor by tracing the conceptual correspondences between her writings and early information theory, including the work of Norbert Weiner, Claude Shannon, and Vannevar Bush. The article argues that Stein first sees language as data that human beings are compelled to parse in even the most contextless and semantically noisy frameworks, which shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously difficult prose poem, Tender Buttons; the ease with which meaning can be exchanged emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given meaning is selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of Tender Buttons in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in its positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of signification that animates her wartime memoir Wars I Have Seen. Like words in the poem, political identity in occupied France is unstable and waits to be parsed in the act of encounters with others and with history. In her narrative's foregrounding of and experimental play with the conventions of memoir, Stein discovers the shifting nature of her main character (herself) in a series of ruminations and chance meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in the nodal structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist frames of signification.

        "abstract": " Claims of the supposed disappearance of materiality in digital culture often entail a nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied, personal or creative aspects of earlier writing technologies, including handwriting. Although handwriting was never a fully embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often characterize it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video games. Two recent Nintendo DS games, Scribblenauts (2009) and The World Ends with You (2007), represent two alternative modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. Scribblenauts claims to fully restore the creative properties of handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast, TWEWY claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for critical reflection on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future of the values that handwriting has come to symbolize.  ",

        "abstract": " What is the status of digital literature in contemporary culture? Many scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside or in opposition to the mainstream. The notion of the avant-garde might seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future. Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly influential today – within the art community and within popular culture. As Peter Bürger and others have discussed, an important division grew up in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the Situationists).  While the digital literature community is in general committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in part on the political grounds that (technological) innovation has become a byword for the digital culture industry. Although the modernist problem is still apparent in some digital art and digital literature today, writers such as Jason Nelson seem to be moving beyond that dialectic. ",

        "abstract": " The original usage of avatar referred to the incarnation or human appearance of a deity, particularly Vishnu, in Hindu mythology. The term was adapted to cyberspace to name one’s online persona. This usage has come to include every aspect of one’s online representation, from the icon on a blog, or an email signature to the figure one plays in Second Life. Avatar, then, is a practical point of entry for theorizing the emergence of the new identity experience of electracy, that is supplementing and displacing selfhood, the identity formation of literacy. Playing one’s avatar is to electracy what writing an essay is to literacy. The point addressed in this essay is that an avatar is not merely the appearance of one’s representation, since through interactivity and even telepresence, I am t/here with my image. What is it to be/have an image? The answer begins with noting the literal meaning of the avatar in Sanskrit: Descent. Vishnu has descended (taken on embodiment) nine times, to correct a disordered world condition. This essay initiates a review of the cultural archive to see what is known already about our question (representations of descent). It is perhaps obvious, considering the prominence of Christianity in our heritage, that the West accumulated a huge amount of information about becoming body. Two examples are referenced in this introductory piece: Krishna and Orpheus. ",

        "abstract": " Existing scholarship on interactive fiction (IF, also known as the text adventure) tends to treat it as a video game genre and/or as a category of electronic literature. In this essay I argue that IF can be understood as participating in traditions of visual prose and ekphrastic textuality, insofar as IF consists of room and object descriptions which direct the player to visualize the things they describe. Unlike traditional ekphrastic literature, however, IF also asks the player to take practical actions in response to the images he or she visualizes. During the commercial era of IF, ekphrasis was the most effective means available of providing players with immersive visual experiences. However, graphical video games have now surpassed IF in this area. Therefore, in order to justify the continued existence of IF, contemporary IF authors have been forced to conceive of the visuality of IF otherwise than in terms of the logic of transparency. One strategy for doing this, exemplified by Nick Montfort's game, Ad Verbum, is to abandon visuality almost entirely and emphasize IF's linguistic and textual qualities. An alternative strategy, exemplified by Emily Short's game City of Secrets, is to assert that IF is visual in a non-transparent way, because IF offers visual experiences which are user-generated rather than pre-rendered.

        "abstract": " Despite a general interest in exploring the possibilities of multimedia and web-based research, the humanities profession has been slow to accept digital scholarship as a valid form of intellectual endeavor. Questions about labor, peer-review, and co-authorship often arise in academic departments’ attempts to evaluate digital research in the tenure and promotion process. In this essay, we argue that these tensions stem from a general misunderstanding of the kinds of work that goes into producing scholarship in multimedia form. Multimedia work, we suggest, places scholars in an extended network that combines minds, bodies, machines, and institutional practices, and lays bare the fiction that scholars are disembodied intellectuals who labor only with the mind. We argue that while traditional ideas of what counts as scholarship continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical labor, and print over digital media, new media’s functional (and in some cases even biological) difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars working in multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and their material labor.

        "abstract": " Locative technologies hold out the promise to transform literary space in all of its dimensions, including its represented spaces, reading interfaces, and the very spaces within which literature is produced and consumed. Yet, despite the growing use of location-based technologies, authors and readers alike have been slow to take to site-specific narrative due to limitations inherent in both the current design of locative media systems and our received notions of what constitutes the narrative experience. This paper argues that new mobile reading platforms in general are altering conceptions of literary space in highly conflicted ways, by radically expanding the sites where narratives can be accessed and experienced even as they reinforce a residual notion of literary reading as a sedentary and decontextualized experience. Locative media likewise hold out the promise of increased mobility and contextual awareness, but confront several cultural and technological factors preventing such an enhanced emplacement of narrative, factors that current performance-oriented approaches cannot fully address. At the level of cognitive engagement, the conditioned expectation of being transported to a remote fictional world interferes with readers' appreciation of the locative narrative's close ties to the real world, as well as the contextual effects it elicits by means of transportation through the actual world. At the technical level, the discontinuous algorithms of place that inform the architecture of most locative media systems hinder the perception of narrative patterning and flow across more extensive spaces. Locative media thus operationalize the spatial tension between conventionally sedentary modes of literary engagement and new modalities of mobility, a tension that is constitutive of our present mediality. The study concludes with a discussion of StoryTrek, a next-generation locative hypernarrative system designed to enable more complex, dynamic and fluid modes of embodied narrative spatiality. By encouraging the user to actively form complex narrative links between real and fictional spaces, StoryTrek enables utopian forms of spatial play that neutralize both the spatial limitations of current locative media design and the sedentary reading practices that continue to structure the experience of digital literature.

What if we shift our attention decidedly to practices, processes, procedures — towards ways of writing and ways of reading rather than dwelling on either textual artifacts themselves (even time-based literary objects) or the concepts underpinning objects-as-artifact? What else can we do, given that we must now write on, for, and with the net which is itself no object but a seething mass of manifold processes? Part one of the essay presents a brief analysis of recent experiments in writing to be found with Google, making some claim that such writing may be exemplary, that its aesthetic and conceptual engagements are distinct, and that there is something at stake here for the literary or rather for certain practices of literary art. After very brief discussion in part two of some broader implications of writing with the Google corpus and its tools, part three addresses more examples of writing to be found, and introduces a collaboration with Daniel Howe, The Readers Project, many processes of which engage with writing to be found in Google and making use of its tools.

This discourse provides a relationship between structure and function that is used in attempts to model thought in technological devices, as in the work of Vannevar Bush and JCR Licklider. These technological instantiations of nodalism in turn provide the material basis for the expansion of the discourse into other domains, such as politics and economics. The paper concludes by considering the potential positive and negative consequence of nodalism, and the role of the digitial humanities in the reproduction of this discourse. ",

W. Marinetti, Kay Boyle, Nancy Cunard, Eugene Jolas, and many others. Each of these contributors had sent works prepared for Bob Brown's machine, and he called the prepared texts readies. In the midst of building the collection of texts, the researcher realized that moving the texts through an electronic version of Brown's machine, or through the interface constructed on the website to simulate Brown's machine, changed how one read — even changed the essence of what one read. Speed, pace, direction, and visual cues took on new importance already apparent in reading printed texts, but not stressed. Punctuation now represented an illegible and non-representational, visual cue rather than a direct link to the phono-centric pauses and stops that are more commonly represented by punctuation. The futures of reading, and the use of new devices like e-readers, will have consequences for the definition and practice of what we call reading. ",

        "abstract": " Research since the early years of the 21st century consistently shows that through the years more of our time gets spent using media, that being concurrently exposed to media has become a foundational feature of everyday life, and that consuming media for most people increasingly takes place alongside producing media. Contemporary media devices, what people do with them, and how all of this fits into the organization of our everyday life disrupt and unsettle well-established views of the role media play in society. Instead of continuing to wrestle with a distinction between media and society, this contribution proposes we begin our thinking with a view of life not lived with media, but in media. The media life perspective starts from the realization that the whole of the world and our lived experience in it are framed by, mitigated through, and made immediate by (immersive, integrated, ubiquitous and pervasive) media.

        "abstract": " Despite DH’s long history, it is still perceived as a relatively emergent academic discipline which has several implications for its ongoing development and acceptance. In order to understand its role in supporting the field’s development and acceptance, SSHRC commissioned a survey of the larger Humanities and Social Science’s community to understand the issues related to DH’s development and acceptance and the types of activities that should be funded. The survey results suggest there is reason for optimism regarding the growing acceptance of digital methods, resources and tools and electronic dissemination as instructors, researchers, and students are using and publishing in digital outlets and creating and employing digital recourses, methods and tools andventuring into new research fields. This trend is likely to continue as students and younger scholars continue to embrace the digital in all aspects of their personal and professional lives. However, this optimism should be tempered to some extent as students and junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors to present and publish their digital-oriented research for a variety of reasons. The field’s more senior faculty can mentor their junior colleagues and students to this end and shape salary, tenure and promotion policies to recognize and reward these efforts. Finally, issues remain around the amount of funding required for the initial development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital resources and may become more critical over time. Granting agencies will need to evaluate their funding role in this regard. ",

        "abstract": " Where will all the books go? A version of that question has occupied commentary about Amazon’s Kindle since news of its release first made its way to public attention in September 2007. Posed out of curiosity, excitement, as well as trepidation, the question includes anxiety about the re-invention of reading embodied by new features and the intricacies of downloading policy. In this essay, I focus on disappearance for the ways in which it indexes concerns about the Kindle’s material impact on reading. Tracking these concerns, I turn to three major moments in the Kindle’s biography in order to emphasize Amazon’s investment in mimicking the transcendence associated with reading and the ways in which this investment is met, and at times exceeded, by readerly desires to possess that transcendence. That the very name Kindle should occasion parallels between e-reading and book burning, that Jeff Bezos should claim unobtrusiveness as the device’s exemplary feature, and that Amazon’s unannounced deletions of Orwell’s 1984 from thousands of Kindle libraries should meet with such ire, makes visible the two ideologies of reading — on the one hand, the invaluable (because ephemeral) force of reading and on the other, reading as a relation of ownership and agency — that stand in both an uneasy and profitable tension for Amazon and its reader-consumers.

        "abstract": " Comics, comic books, and graphic novels are increasingly the target of seriously scholarly attention in the humanities. Moreover, comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with other complex documents studied by humanists — illuminated manuscripts, artists’ books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated children’s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media. Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book publications, provides an overview and examples of the key features of the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some of the problems and challenges in the encoding and digital representation of comic books, and outlines plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and textual elements.

        "abstract": " The contemporary digital media ecology is one of convergence and hybridity. As virtual and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly complex formulations, the ability to identify organic vs. technical forms has become problematic. Virtual environments predominate within everyday cultural practice arguably limiting real or unmediated human experience. The advent of social media artifacts and networks in particular — those that create fusions of personal experience and communal activity and that support and broadcast user-generated content as a foundation for media productions of real-life — have made organic bodies and personal experience difficult to discern.  Extending Mark B.N. Hansen’s model for identifying embodied experience within contemporary mixed reality culture, I argue that embodied expression is more, not less, present in the contemporary media age. Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile forces and that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core of many social media artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary culture and operating outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation. Recovering the organic body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the functional non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those dependant on documenting the minutiae of real-life under-represented in mainstream and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide, situating the me or the embodied subject within production is problematic. I identify such embodiment within contemporary social media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the human body does not operate from a position of erasure within social media networks and artifacts, and its expressive value is therefore central in much current user-generated me-dia.

Without understanding and managing this relationship, there is a danger that student projects lapse into exceedingly reductive pragmatism or overly theorised clumsiness.

In particular, the digital places a central emphasis on abstraction, and digital artifacts and culture demonstrate this ontology of abstraction even while remaining concrete. The kinds of social structures grouped under the label Web 2.0 exemplify the materialized abstraction of the digital, and this essay points out the formal and technical features of the digital that carry the abstract nature of the binary code into the human relations and behaviors of Web 2.0.

        "abstract": " Digital technology often gives us the chance to re-conceive common scholarly practices with the humanities, and one of these is the practice of annotation.  Whereas many in the digital humanities look at annotation through the lens of social media, in this paper we consider annotation’s already established function in scholarship: to support the development of an interpretation of a body of material.  It begins by applying a “software application” perspective to annotation and it notes that personal annotation sits at the nexus between the publishing application of the material being annotated, and an interpretation development application that aims to support the reader’s thinking. Once this application orientation is taken up, it becomes evident that it is useful to re-conceptualise aspects of annotation beyond the annotation-of-media focus which the World Wide Web has encouraged in all of us. The paper does this by considering annotation in an application that is not media oriented in nature, Northwestern University’s WordHoard, and it explores some of the significance of annotation where the application’s data model – with its inherent semantic significance – is available to be annotated. There is a growing interest in thinking of the WWW as a delivery mechanism for software applications rather than merely for documents, and thus many of the issues that this paper raises could apply to the work of web-oriented developers too.

After reviewing the ways in which anamorphosis has been deployed as a philosophical tool for investigating digital media in terms of human phenomenology, specifically through the criticism of Espen Aarseth and Mark Hansen, this paper analyzes how contemporary videogames like Sony’s Echochrome series, levelHead by Julian Oliver, and Mark ten Bosch’s forthcoming Miegakure technically, aesthetically, and conceptually explore anamorphic techniques. While The Ambassadors is famous for its anamorphically skewed skull, a classic memento mori, we propose that the anamorphic effects of videogames can be more accurately described as a memento mortem mortis: not reminders of human mortality, but of a nonhuman the death of death. By foregrounding the impossibility of ever fully resolving the human experience of computational space, the memento mortem mortis in these anamorphic games gestures toward experiential domains altogether indifferent to human phenomenology to create allegories of the beyond.

        "abstract": " A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities (Day of DH) is a community documentation project that brings together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day, typically March 18. The goal of the project, which has been run three times since 2009, is to bring together participants to reflect on the question, Just what do computing humanists really do? To do this, participants document their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links, tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH as a collaborative publication. In terms of improvements, we have over the iterations changed the handling ethics clearances for images and connected to other social media like Twitter. ",

        "abstract": " The past decade has seen a remarkable proliferation of new works of constrained and appropriated writing that prominently incorporate, and in turn investigate, metadata schemes. I argue that these works ought to be of considerable interest not only to critics of contemporary avant-garde writing — but also to media theorists, librarians and textual scholars. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual writing makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these fields. Each of the four main books under discussion here — Tan Lin’s Seven Controlled Vocabularies, Craig Dworkin’s Perverse Library, M. Nourbese Philip’s Zong! and Simon Morris’ Getting Inside Jack Kerouac’s Head — draws upon pre-existing textual archives. In doing so, these books suggest that processes of data storage, classification and transmission are key to how poetry is created, recognized and disseminated. Conceptual writing’s attention to information classification protocols offers not only a critique of contemporary models of authorship, but also of contemporary frameworks of personal agency and intellectual property.

        "abstract": " This paper contributes to the literature examining the burgeoning field of academic crowdsourcing, by analysing the results of the crowdsourced manuscript transcription project, Transcribe Bentham. First, it describes how the project team sought to recruit volunteer transcribers to take part, and discusses which strategies were successes (and which were not). We then examine Transcribe Bentham's results during its six-month testing period (8 September 2010 to 8 March 2011), which include a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of website statistics, work completed by the amateur transcribers, as well as the demographics of the volunteer base and their motivations for taking part. The paper concludes by discussing the success of our community building with reference to this analysis. We find that Transcribe Bentham's volunteer transcribers have produced a remarkable amount of work – and continue to do so, carrying out the equivalent labour of a full-time transcriber – despite the nature and complexity of the task at hand.

Whereas news media coverage of its operations considers only their human aspects, mostly in relation to crime and cyberterrorism, Daniel Suarez's recent novel Daemon provides a suggestive glimpse into how, in a webbot assemblage, new forms of human and machinic agency are complexly intricated. The significance of this assemblage becomes further evident when it is considered in relation to how the Internet is increasingly perceived: no longer as a neutral medium but as an ecosystem defined by netwar, software arms races, and the possible evolution of low forms of artificial life.

        "abstract": " Almost since the inception of the industry, the player community has been instrumental in preserving video games and other variable media art. Drawing on a combination of primary and secondary sources of information, including the Preserving Virtual Worlds project (an academic investigation into viable models of preservation for videogames and 3D virtual worlds based on a series of archiving case studies) and the results of a game documentation survey conducted by Donahue, we examine how players are taking responsibility for collecting, managing, curating, and creating long-term access to computer games. Because our interest lies with the contact zone between players and information professionals, we also describe and analyze how we and other scholar-archivists are collaborating with or relying on the user community to preserve virtual worlds, with an eye to how these relationships might eventually be codified within a larger preservation framework.Early versions of portions of this paper were delivered by Kari Kraus, Rachel Donahue, and Megan Winget, Game Change: The Role of Amateur and Professional Cultures in Preserving Virtual Worlds Conference paper.

        "abstract": " This extended interview with Ray Siemens was carried out on June 21st at Digital Humanities 2011, Stanford University. It explores Siemens' early training and involvement in the field that is now known as digital humanities. He recalls that his first experience with computing was as a video gamer and programmer in high school. He had the opportunity to consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he   attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He communicates stronglythe vibrancy of the field that was already apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some of the people in places such as the University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a formative influence on him. He gives a clear sense of some of the factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives to close reading that he was able to bring to bear on his literary research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for example, when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the communication protocol of the internet. He closes by reflecting on the prescience of the advice that his father, also an academic, gave him regarding the use of computing in his research and on his early encounters with the conference scene.

        "abstract": " John Unsworth recounts that he first became involved with computing in the Humanities c. 1989 as a new faculty member at North Carolina State University where he was hired to teach post-World War II American literature. He and his colleagues wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area. They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was called Postmodern Culture and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it. He recounts that was not able to avail of formal training in computing but he did have technical knowledge of computing, mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital humanities. He reflects in detail on the first digital humanities conference he attended in Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that the advent of the Web has heralded.  ",

        "abstract": " Harold Short recounts that his interest in Computing and the Humanities goes back to when he was an undergraduate in English and French at a university in the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). There, whilst undertaking summer work in the library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450 people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late Antonio Zampolli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have had an impact on digital humanities centres.  ",

        "abstract": " This interview was carried out with Willard McCarty on Tuesday 27th March, 2012 in University College London. He recounts that his earliest encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkley where he worked with semi-automated scanning equipment for the Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. So, he learned to programme on the job with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English Drama project whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a research project on Ovid's Metamorphosis. He closes the interview by reflecting on his early involvement with the conference scene and people who have influenced him, from academics to his calligraphy teacher Lloyd Reynolds.       ",

        "abstract": " This extended interview with Geoffrey Rockwell was carried out via Skype on the 28th April 2012. He narrates that he had been aware of computing developments when growing up in Italy but it was in college in the late 1970s that he took formal training in computing. He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone, after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.

Through an open-ended survey and virtual panel discussion, our study outlines the experience of historians using various digital tools. The results of the study reveal the variety of users interested in digital tools as well as their enthusiasm, reactions, and frustrations, including the expectations and confusion that has created barriers to tool use and to the wider adoption of new research methodologies. We suggest that an emphasis on cultivating a broader audience must be a concern not only for tool builders but also for funders to account adequately for the time and expense of quality interfaces and documentation.

        "abstract": " This paper will briefly survey the historical development of linking systems in the Christian Bible, from their theological foundations to their formation in the architecture of the printed book. It will then examine the apogee of intra-Biblical linking systems in the Thompson Chain Reference Bible, particularly its chain-referencing system for thematic linking between texts. Finally, it will use this mature print technology to consider the state of the hyperlink in current Web-interfaces. It will show that while in many ways modern attempts at a dynamic hyperlink surpass this elaborate linking system in functionality, in a few key functions this old print technology out-performs what is commonly and readily available in current Web-browsers. In pursing this comparative analysis we aim to demonstrate the importance of understanding the organization and navigational structure of the codex in designing digital reading environments that will meet and surpass the affordances of print.

        "abstract": " As museums increasingly place archival materials on display, a body of scholarship has emerged to provide practical advice for staff about exhibiting handwritten documents. However, there has as yet been little scholarship that problematizes the exhibition of manuscripts and the responses they elicit from their audiences. This essay, then, investigates the cultural perception of handwriting as an inherently unique and authentic embodiment of its writer, the assumption of which lies behind its display. Through a series of close readings of responses to the sight of the autograph, I examine the ways in which handwriting’s association with the human body has been historically shaped and interpreted; its current function as a locus for concerns about the loss or degradation of corporeal identity in an increasingly technologized world; and how multimedia museum exhibitions of handwritten documents — as digitally manipulable surrogates of original artifacts — expose, complicate, and break down the oppositions in this cultural discourse. Ultimately, I argue, digital interactives are part of a new exhibitionary paradigm, which not only offers new ways of considering an artifact’s essential meaning, but also refines and redefines our understanding of human effort, intentionality, and embodiment in a digital age.

        "abstract": " This critical essay was written for the Prairie Art Gallery catalogue presenting Kate Armstrong's and Michael Tippett's Grafik Dynamo! Its argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in the present scholarly format, namely that narrative, associated with the development of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to literary arts produced in and for the electronic medium. Narrative in the Dynamo! is not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the place of argumentation in critical writing. The Dynamo! develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a cited image from the Dynamo! Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself. References are made to Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, to Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear, non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this context, Graphic Sublime also introduces a major, as yet unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter, Valparaiso.  ",

        "abstract": " Digital humanities and medieval studies share a long history, beginning with one of the first large-scale digital humanities projects, which was carried by Father Roberto Busa using IBM’s Literary Data Processing Center. Why then, do many scholars of historically-minded fields consider digital humanities to be a “helping discipline” instead of a full-fledged area of study in itself? Beginning with the above question, this paper explores the ways in which scholars need not use the digital humanities to update historical disciplines or vice versa. By examining the pre- and post-print histories of the book, and interrogating the ways in which reading technologies and interfaces link the past and future of the book together, the past and present histories of reading coalesce and offer scholars novel ways of approaching many different disciplines that engage with the digital humanities.

This subject’s engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the social bond of discourse. I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of Lacan’s four discourses – of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I conclude that deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy, mapped by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and the University – on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented, but also narrowed – to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more productive of new forms of knowledge.

As a consequence, our approach to culture may be modified because technology allows us to now visualize our thoughts and theories using digital and computing techniques. This research focuses on merging humanities research with computational sciences to explore the processes involved in culture dynamics. We present an interdisciplinary approach that combines literary studies, economics, and agent-based modeling (ABM) and give details of how literature maybe used as a data set that can be translated into a dynamic Java-based simulation of human interactions constructed around Game Theory. Our model of Cross-Cultural Cooperation is designed to study culture at various levels of granularity simultaneously in order to show how micro-behaviors might lead to macro outcomes such as cultural group formation. We present one experiment based on the literature of discovery and conquest in the U.S. Southwest translated into the language of ABM. Additionally, we explore the role of space, time, and population-size in this process and offer a discussion of possible future directions for this type of research. The creation of our simulator of cultural exchange between individuals of differing cultures allows researchers to experiment with ideas about first and ongoing contact and speculate with “What if?” scenarios.

Discussions of the materiality of digital media have become richer and more complex in the last decade, calling the literal, physical, and networked qualities of digital artifacts and systems to attention. This article extends those discussions by reconnecting them to a longer history of investigations of materiality and the specificity of media in critical theory and aesthetics. In addition, it introduces the concept of performative materiality, the enacted and event-based character of digital activity supported by those literal, physical conditions, and introduces the theoretical concerns that attach to that rubric. Performative materiality is based on the conviction that a system should be understood by what it does, not only how it is structured. As digital humanities matures, it can benefit from a re-engagement with the mainstream principles of critical theory on which a model of performative materiality is based. The article takes these ideas into a more focused look at how we might move towards integrating this model and critical principles into a model of humanistic interface design. ",

        "abstract": " In this article, Cordell demonstrates the transformative possibilities of large-scale digital archives for literary history and bibliography. Focusing on the recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story, The Celestial Railroad, in the nineteenth-century press, the article demonstrates the central, shaping influence of religious readers and editors on Hawthorne’s early career. Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of Hawthorne’s works could be dramatically altered after only a few weeks’ work in digital archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively simple search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known witnesses of the text, but also uncovered numerous paratexts: introductions to the story, articles reviewing or referring to the story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This social text of The Celestial Railroad, Cordell argues, lay buried amidst millions of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth century and required modern tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how digital interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of The Celestial Railroad using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues that textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were understood by their original publishers and readers. The many changes to and discussions of The Celestial Railroad, for instance, indicate that the tale was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but nonetheless deployed as a weapon in denominational debates.

        "abstract": " Artistic representations of African-descendant cultures in Latin America, the Hispanic Caribbean, and the Hispanic World have emerged as the outcome of multiple exchanges, inventions, and cultural coexistences. Such representations take part of a network where cultural, ethnic, social, artistic, literary, and racial information circulates, giving shape to centers with multiple connections at different scales. In accordance with this, the main aim of this article is to demonstrate how Cuba’s predominance for the representation of such cultural pattern is not only based on the significance of particular artistic figures, but also on the connectivity that the island as a cultural node has with respect to the ‘global’  network of African and African-descendant representations. In order to achieve this aim, we carry out two main tasks: a) network analysis looking at related concepts such as centrality, connectivity, betweenness, modularity, etc., through a methodology that takes into account topic-map analysis and the use of Page Ranking Algorithm [the algorithm used by good part of search engines such as Google] as the basic formula to filter and organize information; b) local analysis of two nodes that take part of Cuba’s cluster in order to compare the results of the analysis of networks with a more socio-literary analysis that focuses on detailed reading of some of their messages (works, paratexts, prologues, interviews, etc): Nicolás Guillén and Alejo Carpentier. As matter of conclusions, we evaluate not only our findings with regards to Cuba but also the methodology as a contribution to the field of the Digital humanities and its practices of analysis. ",

        "abstract": " Computational literary analytics that include frequency trends and collocation, topic modeling, and network analysis have relied on rapid and large-scale analysis of the word or strings of words. This essay shows that there are many other features of literary texts by which humanists make meaning other than the word, such as prosody and sound, and how computational methods allow us to do what has historically been a more difficult method of analysis — trying to understand how literary texts make meaning with these features. This paper will discuss a case study that uses theories of knowledge representation and research on phonetic and prosodic symbolism to develop analytics and visualizations that help readers discover aural and prosodic patterns in literary texts. To this end, this paper has two parts: (I) We describe the theories of knowledge representation and research into phonetic and prosodic symbolism that underpin the logics and ontologies of aurality incorporated in our project. This basic theory of aurality is reflected in our use of OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features; in the flow we coordinated to pre-process texts in SEASR’s Meandre, a data flow environment; in the instance-based predictive modeling procedure that we developed for the project; and in ProseVis, the reader interface that we created to allow readers to discover aural features across literary texts. And (II), we discuss readings of several works by Gertrude Stein (the portraits Matisse and Picasso and the prose poem Tender Buttons) that were facilitated by this work. ",

        "abstract": " Embedded in the rich textual record of international copyright law, we often encounter a quaint, and perhaps naïve definition of the literary around which the law has crystallized and which has the potential to influence the work of all digital humanists, whether they think of themselves as literary scholars or not. The first part of this article explores how a relatively narrow definition of the literary as a category of high or belletristic cultural production has informed the contours of U.S. copyright law, in particular. Section 101, Title 17 of the United States Code expressly defines literary works as any works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied . US courts have, however, often employed a narrower, more commonplace understanding of the literary as an aesthetic category when sorting artifacts or content into other legally more significant categories such as idea, expression, criticism, parody, and satire. The second section of the article considers some of the potential implications and consequences of the current regulatory structure for the work of digital humanists. Judges engaging in a fair use analysis more often than not expect scholarship to come packaged in print monographs written in academic language aimed at an audience of disciplinary specialists. When they encounter scholarly artifacts that depart from those formal expectations and draw from pre-existing work, judges are less likely to find the use of pre-existing work is fair and therefore non-infringing. Finally, the article examines whether the literary as a category should be abandoned altogether, or whether digital humanists might productively redefine the literary as part of a strategy for re-imagining the institutional and legal regulations that govern academic work.

        "abstract": " Junot Díaz’s writing actively questions the boundaries between genre and literary fiction, aesthetics and politics, and English and Spanish, using a framework of multiple linguistic, formal and cultural registers to establish an authorial presence that defies critical categorization. Díaz arrived explosively on the U.S. literary scene with his second book, the novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. The multi-generational story of a Dominican American family overshadowed by a brutal dictatorship and the challenges of forging a new life in the United States earned many accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. I read Díaz’s transgressive blending of genre and linguistic registers as a reverse colonization that calls into question the demarcations of American ethnicity as well as the racial politics of nerds. My argument uses Díaz as both an object of study and a paradigm for the potential of a hybrid digital humanities methodology. The complex cultural translation that Díaz asks his readers to perform creates a middle ground where Caribbean history, language politics and the class and ethnic tensions of immigration collide with the nerdy core of the mainstream American imagination.

        "abstract": " In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the Modern Language Association issued a Statement on the Significance of Primary Records in order to assert the importance of retaining books and other physical artifacts even after they have been microfilmed or scanned for general consumption. A primary record, the MLA told us then, can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given instance (27). Today, the conceit of a primary record can no longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a physical object. Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records. In the specific domain of the literary, a writer working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because the basic material evidence of their authorial activity — manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals — is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. This essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the emergence of a .txtual condition — I am of course remediating Jerome McGann’s influential notion of a “textual condition” — amid our contemporary constructions of the literary, along with the changing nature of literary archives, and lastly activities in the digital humanities as that enterprise is now construed. In particular, I will use the example of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of resources and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table when confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript repositories will increasingly be receiving.

At the same time, the question of what is specific to the literary in discussions of electronic textuality, or the digital literary, has been under-analyzed. This article contributes to theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or close reading) of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction novel by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment when the imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense interest to both cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of the writer of vernacular literature in the novel, I argue, brings together the text's interest in both electronic textuality and the subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of the digital precisely on a revamped role for the literary in the context of globalization. As such, Ghosh's novel provides a useful opportunity for re-considering proposals for distant reading in relation to world literary studies and postcolonial criticism. ",

This essay considers the \"idiocy\" of the literary: its unaccountable singularity, which guarantees that we continue to return to it as a source, inspiration, and challenge. As a consequence, digital humanities is inspired and irritated by the literary.  My essay shows this in three ways. First, through a speculative exploration of the relation between digital humanities and the category of \"the literary.\" Second, through a quick survey of the use of literature in digital humanities project. Thirdly, through a specific examination of TEI and character rendering as digital humanities concerns that necessarily engage with the literary. Once again, the literary remains singular and not abstract, literal in a way that challenges and provokes us towards new digital humanities work. ",

        "abstract": " This essay is a meditation on the possibility of a feminist assessment of digital literary archives and the interdisciplinary tools needed to do such work. Using the Women Writers Project and The Orlando Project as exemplary instances of digital literary scholarship, I discuss possible sites of feminist intervention (content, technological politics, labor structures,etc) and the kinds of theoretical paradigms one might use in such work. I also argue that such assessments are essential to recognizing the ways in which feminist digital literary studies have impacted the field of digital humanities.  Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the essay problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea that simply saving women’s work in digital form is enough. I conclude with a set of reflections on the impact of shifting ideas about the value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly contexts. This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively highlight the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital literary scholars consider increasing access to not only the work of women, but to the technologies that are integral to that access as well.

        "abstract": " The Transborder Immigrant Tool is a provocative mobile phone app by the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) that provides sustenance to border crossers by leading them to water and guiding them with poetry. Although the tool can be applied to any border, the chief border it has been tied to and tested on is the US-Mexico border. The EDT present the project as an artistic disruption of the tired national political theater staged at that border.  The piece refocuses attention on the basic human needs of those caught in the middle of the stale and stalemated divide.  For the EDT, every part of the piece participates in this disruption not merely the finished app or the poetry but the code as well.  In this paper, I ask, what would it mean for the code to poetic disruption?  One set of poetry for the project created by Amy Sara Carroll offers instructions for desert survival.  By presenting instructions as poems, she offers one entre into reading the source code of the app as poetry.  Using the methods of Critical Code Studies, I read the code of TBT in light of and as part of the poetic intervention of this complex performance. ",

        "abstract": " Curating is often seen as a mediation between artist, work, and audience, with the curator firmly at the center. The central role of the curator has been further emphasized with the rise of the curator as artist and the institutional and physical limitations of museum spaces. We argue that there are important alternative spaces of meaning to be developed between object and audience. Digital curating, in particular, allows for greater audience participation, both by expanding the potential audience and by allowing visitors to navigate through the virtual galleries under their own direction. We contend that by facilitating the site visitors’ creation of their own visual arguments, a new level of audience participation in visual analysis — indeed, in a fundamental intellectual and intuitive aspect of curating — is made possible. We explore how digital resources can be modified to allow for that contextual sense of making a visual argument through arrangement. An installation at the University of Houston debuted a new tool for digital content management and allows us to make some preliminary observations about the process of visual analysis, its role in curatorial practice, and explore future directions for work.

        "abstract": " In this article, the significance of the rhetorical and modern definitions of ekphrasis will be discussed through the lens of digital literature and art. It attempts to reinscribe the body in ekphrastic practice by adding touch to the abstracted visualism of the eye, and emphasize defining features of the ancient usage: orality, immediacy and tactility. What I call the digital ekphrasis with its emphasis on enargeia, its strong connections with the ancient definition, and on the bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic of tactility; digitalis=finger. By tracing and elucidating a historical trajectory that takes the concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as a starting point, the intention is not to reject the theories of the late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis put forward an example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could challenge or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities. In this context ‘the digital’ is not only a phenomenon that could be tied to certain digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an approach to history, with strong critical potential. The aim is to show that one of the most important features of our digital culture is that it offers new perspectives – not only on current technology – but also on literary, cultural and aesthetic historical practices.

Now is the Future Now? argues that the progress made in digital humanities toward these goals has depended and will depend not only on digital data, but also on their appropriate curation. The article defines digital humanities, data, so-called Big Data, and digital curation. Next it examines digital curation initiatives in the sciences and in the humanities that occurred before the release of Our Cultural Commonwealth. It then considers and evaluates the digital curation work undertaken in the sciences and in the humanities after the report’s publication. In theory and in practice digital curation has benefited substantially from practices developed and tested first in the natural sciences and subsequently adapted for and extended in the humanities. Finally, the piece explores the future work necessary to facilitate symbiosis between digital curation and digital humanities. Collaboration and cooperation, transcending geographical, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries, data sharing, policies and planning, education and training, sustainability — all remain pressing issues in 2013.

        "abstract": " Randomly generated content poses problems for theories of digital art: such content is resistant to structural theories, which can only provide templates, and one cannot assume a shared text for close analysis. Instead of reaching fixed endings, such works also tend to be of indefinite length or at least suggest indefinite possible combinations. I argue that the impact of such works can instead be found in how one attempts to work through their underlying grammar, based on limits in the algorithms that generate the content — not those limits themselves, but how their outlines come to be known. Repetitively iterating through these works simultaneously upholds the chance nature of the epiphenomenal occurrences while also illustrating the sameness of the underlying algorithm over time, creating a future-oriented interpretive arc. I examine two works that play off of this technique in different ways: Nick Montfort’s Taroko Gorge, a poetry generator which uses random generation to distill the essence of its object’s possibility, and the action role-playing game Torchlight, which attempts to elevate chance beyond a mere gameplay mechanic and toward an ethic.

        "abstract": " The Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET) offers an alternative to static, two-dimensional visualizations of theatrical text by modeling the process of moving from text to performance in the Western, text-based tradition of live theatre production. Its interface links a three-dimensional ‘Stage View’ populated by character avatars to a ‘Text View’ enhanced with text visualization tools by means of a central ‘Line of Action’ analogous to a timeline. All three parts of the interface can be edited; edits in any individual section appear in the others; and all three can be played back simultaneously. While emphasizing that the traditional medium of theatrical performance is the actor’s body moving in time and space, and providing a digital analogue for that medium, the system also frees users from the limitations of the single, time-bound spectator’s perspective. Potential applications include theatre analysis, theatre pedagogy, and preparation for theatrical production. ",

If this is the case, it ought to concern Digital Humanities (DH) scholars, many of whom continue to be more interested in how we connect than in the substance and dialogue of that very connectedness. I would like to argue for a better balance between the how and the what of DH - for a qualitative turn of sorts away from an interest in gaining and making accessible more information only, to an interest in also making sense of and understanding that information. For such a turn, computer scientists need input from the humanities whose specialty has always been to turn information into knowledge by means of critical interpretation and contextualization. ",

        "abstract": " Digital humanities research that requires the digitization of medium-scale, project-specific texts confronts a significant methodological and practical question: is labour-intensive cleaning of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output necessary to produce robust results through text mining analysis? This paper traces the steps taken in a collaborative research project that aimed to analyze newspaper coverage of a high-profile murder trial, which occurred in New York City in 1873. A corpus of approximately one-half million words was produced by converting original print sources and image files into digital texts, which produced a substantial rate of OCR-generated errors. We then corrected the scans and added document-level genre metadata. This allowed us to evaluate the impact of our quality upgrade procedures when we tested for possible differences in word usage across two key phases in the trial's coverage using log likelihood ratio . The same tests were run on each dataset – the original OCR scans, a subset of OCR scans selected through the addition of genre metadata, and the metadata-enhanced scans corrected to 98% accuracy. Our results revealed that error correction is desirable but not essential. However, metadata to distinguish between different genres of trial coverage, obtained during the correction process, had a substantial impact. This was true both when investigating all words and when testing for a subset of judgment words we created to explore the murder’s emotive elements and its moral implications. Deeper analysis of this case, and others like it, will require more sophisticated text mining techniques to disambiguate word sense and context, which may be more sensitive to OCR-induced errors.  ",

        "abstract": " Internet technologies are gradually reshaping the function of traditional scholarly publications. There is a growing tendency in some disciplines to publish a digital paper together with supplements such as images, videos, 3D-models and underlying data. More information requires a better usability in terms of overview and finding information, which has led to new features in journals and thus to modifying and extending this genre. These so-called enhanced publications or rich internet publications have various physical forms: PDF documents with embedded interactive models, HTML files enriched with hyperlinks to contextual information and with facilities to highlight information in the text, or aggregations of documents and other resources linked together through metadata which make them findable for semantic search engines. However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in format and offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which leaves room for some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a regular journal article. In this paper we introduce the Xpos’re tools for authoring and displaying an interactive multimedia scholarly publication, which may be created as a digital companion to a regular journal paper and published, for example, on the author or institution’s website in order to share related research products and to achieve greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this software in a few research projects. The Xpos’re software (see: http://xposre.nl/software/) comprises a Flash-based document reader and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that extend the basic functionality of this text browser. The extensions are used to display specific types of multimedia that provide additional functionality, such as viewing images, videos and interactive maps. The input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a durable and flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in different formats according to the preferences of users and the limitations of their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily transformed to an RDF resource map to meet the requirements of the semantic web. The document reader generates output in HTML, in two flavors, namely a slide based version that uses JavaScript, and a plain HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for printing and which can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also be displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the Xpos’re HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically generated slides and which can be highly customized by the user.

Songs by female singer-songwriters account for a large portion of the current Japanese hit charts and particularly play an important role in understanding the Japanese language and communication style. In this study, we applied new methods of computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs. The results clearly show differences in the characteristics of 10 female singer-songwriters, and we found that the visualization of the lyrics is a typical characteristic of current singer-songwriters. Our findings provide an important case study for computational stylistics and can also be useful for understanding Japanese cultural trends. ",

It will succeed in its aims if it is both comprehensible to newcomers and stimulating for experienced practitioners: a bridging effort, but one undertaken with serious intent. It proceeds by isolating a key debate for examination, describing two concepts that go a significant distance to solving issues raised by that debate (but not far enough), and exploring the theoretical writings of a selection of high profile digital humanists. The goal (a non-trivial undertaking) is to illustrate the utility of postfoundationalism as a conceptual tool, its interdependence with postindustrial culture, and the light it sheds on our understanding of what DH is. If successful the article, rather than making an essentialist claim that Digital Humanities is defined by postfoundational method, will constitute a contribution to the developing digital humanities agenda.

Good design is user-centered, focused, and needs-driven, all of which depend on a rich understanding of the target audience or end user. Unsworth’s scholarly primitives  and the work of Palmer, Teffeau and Pirmann  on scholarly information practices provide a framework for understanding how humanities scholars do their work. We propose applying this framework to the design of a spoken word archive, with the aim of designing a digital tool that is optimized for the documented practices of scholars. We propose that listening and annotation are key activities of humanities scholars performing literary criticism of audio recordings. Taking the SpokenWeb poetry project as an example, we discuss how designing a web-based tool with these key activities in mind could facilitate close and critical engagement with recordings of spoken poetry. We present a methodology for designing a web-based sound archive for literary criticism and we propose features and functionalities that facilitate this criticism.  ",

But coursework and publications related to DH project management tend to focus heavily on the difficulties of planning and launching a new project rather than the challenges of maintaining an established one. Meanwhile, online advice for would-be managers is couched in the language of tips and tricks or steps for beginners. Together these phenomena downplay the professional skills needed to successfully manage a project while suggesting that project management is necessary only in the beginning stages of an endeavor. They may even give the impression that scholarship in the digital humanities is inherently ephemeral. Through a case study of project management practices at the William Blake Archive, which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this essay details the challenges and rewards of managing an established digital humanities project. Managers of mature projects may be called upon to oversee expansions in scope and mission, research and recommend new features and tools, grow or shrink the number of project staff, seek out alternate sources of support when early grants run out, maintain continuity as collaborators join and leave the project, and develop new workflows and procedures to reflect these and other changes.

        "abstract": " With the digitization of the parliamentary proceedings (Handelingen der Staten Generaal), the structuring of this body of data, and the development of an advanced search engine, we can apply new methods of historical research. This contributes to a further promotion of the sophisticated use of quantitative data to enhance qualitative historical research. This article focuses on the Boerenpartij(Farmers’ Party), the first political party from the far right that entered Dutch parliament after the Second World War (WWII). The Boerenpartij is remembered as being stigmatized by the traditional political parties as wrong ( fout ), as National Socialism and its supporters were dubbed in the Netherlands. However, no systematic research has been conducted on the questions: in what way, how frequently and for what purpose these connections with the wrong past were made. With the available digitized data and the retrieval techniques offered by computer scientists it is now possible to answer these questions.  ",

It proposes an alternative digital humanities approach to the study of world literature, advocating new methods of close comparative reading rather than the mode of distant reading endorsed by Franco Moretti and Alan Liu . Specifically, the research method proposed here is focused on a close reading of the novel The Secret Scripture (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative reference to Pat Barker’s well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the development and implementation of a digital humanities research method which facilitates new forms of digital literary analysis, we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too be practicing partners in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields of world literature and digital literary studies.

        "abstract": " Among the many reactions against the digital revolution is a humanitarian movement toward long form online reading in collective and social networks. This movement — visible in online book clubs such as Infinite Summer and 1book140, websites such as longreads.com, and the trend of blogs-to-books publication — is a reaction against superficial increasingly brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to action by the threat of what critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as digital culture’s narrative depravation, the deep reading revival has reclaimed narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming reading into an act of mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Despite studies corroborating Nicholas Carr’s claim in The Shallows (2011) that the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to immersive linear deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and accelerated the appreciation of longer richer works through its support of radial reading as described by Jerome McGann. This essay argues that while the intrinsically distracting virtual geography of the Internet has threatened to diminish the role of textured narrative in our intellectual and social lives, the Web has ironically provided the media for the most salient movements in support of the deep reading it threatens to obliterate.

Canonical numbers are complex interpretive mechanisms with a great deal of potential for anyone editing and using electronic texts. In this essay I consider the rationale for and nature of canonical reference systems, to recommend principles to consider when deploying them in digital projects. After briefly reviewing the history of canonical references I note how they have been used so far, emphasizing the advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue that the practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how notional literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). By correlating a theory of canonical reference numbers with those two models — editorial workflow and creative works — I offer key principles that should be addressed when planning, writing, and using digital projects.

        "abstract": " For Vilém Flusser, philosopher of technology, the advent of photography heralded the return of the image from its subjection to the linearity of written language. Here we extend his concept of the techno-image (successor of the pre-historical hand-drawn image and the historical printed word), to consider the digital image-text that today dominates reading and writing. Our question: Can we reader-writers think the digitas, or are we doomed to perform its functions in an automati[c] or robotiz[ed] fashion, as Flusser put it, so that, if anything, the digitas now thinks us? The short answer to our question is as follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of writing (digital orthography) and, secondly, as a caricature of thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, funny (digital caricature).

Pay close attention to the balance of traditional methods and new ways of conducting research. When gathering resources to do the job, seek contributions of different domain experts. Also, careful consideration of a tool’s intended scope will help refine the required resources needed to complete a project. This case study illustrates how one project, the Social Networks and Archival Context Project (SNAC), has defined these variables. The process of building a new tool also benefits from an awareness of older infrastructure that has come before it. SNAC illustrates this awareness in the way it has taken advantage of previously existing infrastructure, both cyber and not, by extending its purpose and building new features on top of it. ",

        "abstract": " The digital era has become inundated with the idea of anonymity as on the Internet where users create avatars in forums and write without obvious material constraint; however when considering documents such as graphic novels and print fiction, the figure of the author remains a nostalgic figure which grants validity to the document. In classic comic book collections such as Watchmen and Batman: Year One by Alan Moore and Frank Miller, the original scripts by the authors are included in special editions in both print and Kindle format. But these original script pages are shrouded in forms of anonymity as they illustrate signs of digitization, either through scanning or during production and thus display various visual clues, such as errors, which relay levels of realness. Furthermore online versions of these script pages, found on fan website databases and authors’ blogs, are complicated by the anonymity the Internet and digital editions produce. Therefore a digital forensics methodology is used to interrogate these script pages in both print and digital format to create an ordering system for digitally manipulated text. It also endeavours to illustrate the possibilities for a forming digital forensics field by using various technical calculations and recreations of text with original software and hardware. ",

Aspects of the science question that consider the politics underlying epistemologies of purportedly value-neutral claims and practices resonate for the work (the research, theory, and practices) being done to build information infrastructure in the humanities today — the work that I am defining here as digital humanities work. Reconsidering this work by using the lens of feminist inquiry to understand the concerns common to information science and digital humanities is the perspective I describe here. Specifically, as my title suggests, I am proposing that feminist inquiry can help us articulate and better understand the epistemologies in digital humanities and information science that are shaping the infrastructures we are building and using in the humanities.

Prior to my interventions, the primary method for reading faint, obscured, and obliterated manuscript texts had been multi-spectral imaging, which is prohibitively expensive, limiting its utility as a general research tool, although it is still sometimes in use. There have not been many alternative digital paleographical methodologies. The potential of image manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, has been noted by a few scholars, but not explored. Working in Adobe Photoshop, I have developed a method of deciphering heavily deleted or obliterated text through the use of layering techniques, altered color levels, and the employment of certain kinds of filters. The method is more advanced than simple image enlargement techniques used by most researchers. Importantly though, it remains far less expensive than multi-spectral imaging. The technique contributed to the recovery of nearly all of the obliterated text in the first two volumes of The Court Journals and Letters of Frances Burney, which were published by Oxford University Press in 2011, and it was also used within in-progress volumes from The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson. This article discusses the methodology and some of its key results from eighteenth-century manuscripts. ",

Screenplays contain capitalized character names, indented dialogue, and other formatting conventions that enable an algorithmic approach to analyzing and visualizing film narratives. In this article, the authors introduce their new tool, ScripThreads, which parses screenplays, outputs statistical values which can be analyzed, and offers four different types of visualization, each with its own utility. The visualizations represent character interactions across time as a single 3D or 2D graph. The authors model the utility of the tool for the close analysis of a single film (Lawrence Kasdan’s Grand Canyon [1991]). They also model how the tool can be used for distant reading by identifying patterns of character presence across a dataset of 674 screenplays. ",

The Electronic Literature Organization’s 2012 Media Art Show, for example, hosted exhibits in five different locations in Morgantown, including a community arts center, local gallery, the university library, a department’s conference room, and the city’s amphitheater, while the MLA 2012 and 2013 exhibits were held at the Washington State and Hynes convention centers, respectively. The Library of Congress, the most important repository of books in the U.S., hosted Electronic Literature & Its Emerging Forms in April 2013 while Illuminations gallery at University of Ireland Maymooth featured an exhibit of electronic literature in March 2014. This range of venues suggests a flexibility and appeal of electronic literature that is both scalable and broad. With these qualities in mind, this article outlines the various exhibits of electronic literature that the author has curated in order to highlight the two main challenges facing all scholars curating digital –– that is, the challenge of availability and the challenge of presentation.

How can a computer simulation tell us anything about the past? This essay has three distinct goals. The first is simply to introduce agent-based modeling as a computational practice to an audience of digital humanists, for whom it remains largely unfamiliar despite signs of increasing interest. Second, to introduce one possible application for social simulation by comparing it to conventional, print-based models of the history of book publishing. Third, and most importantly, I’ll sketch out a theory and preliminary method for incorporating social simulation into an on-going program of humanities research. ",

        "abstract": " As humanities scholars increasingly recognize the value of public engagement, and as the proportion of tenure-track faculty positions available to new graduates continues to decline, many humanities programs are focusing renewed attention on equipping graduate students for careers as scholars both within and beyond academe. To support those efforts, the Scholarly Communication Institute has carried out a study investigating perceptions about career preparation provided by humanities graduate programs. The survey results help to create a more solid foundation on which to base curricular reform and new initiatives by moving the conversation about varied career paths from anecdote to data. The findings make it clear that there are a number of effective interventions that programs can undertake. Many of the skills that people working beyond the tenure track identify as crucial to their positions — things like project management, collaboration, and communication — are also highly beneficial to those working within the professoriate. Structuring courses and projects in a way that emphasizes the acquisition of these skills not only contributes to the success of students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but also to the vibrant research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic roles. With the availability of new data to work from and the recommendations above as possible guiding principles, graduate programs have a robust set of tools available that can help facilitate curricular assessment and new initiatives. As the importance of assessing the effectiveness of existing structures and considering potential benefits of reform continues to grow, humanities programs have a strong incentive to demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs contribute to the vitality of the university and the broader public sphere. Equipping graduate students with the skills and literacies needed for 21st century scholarly work — from technical fluency to an understanding of organizational structures — is critical to ensuring continued rigorous and creative research, scholarship, and teaching.

        "abstract": " Co-teaching a digital archives course (ENGL-GA.2971) for graduate students in the English Department allowed us to bring together our expertise in both research and pedagogy from two fields: English Literature and Computer Science. The course built on a core pedagogical principle in Computer Science of teaching through projects rather than from unrelated one-off programming or web development assignments. Teaching the Text Encoding Initiative after students had completed hands-on projects (using xHTML, CSS, and a digital archive working in a standard content management system) enabled the building of technological skill sets in a logical and complementary manner. From a literary perspective, building a digital archive — and teaching text encoding — enabled an in-depth consideration of textual materiality, the processes through which literary scholarship must inform technological building decisions, and the ways in which the act of digitization can be used to ask new questions of the text (or to prompt the text to ask new questions of itself). This paper will survey our techniques and approaches to interdisciplinary teaching, culminating in our usage of text encoding for exploring issues of textuality through digital presentation. ",

        "abstract": " When game studies became an area for scholarly inquiry in the academy, feminist game studies soon followed. The first generation of feminist theory in game studies built on the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel, and Janet Murray, although some might argue that the legacy of challenging gender norms in game studies goes back even earlier. Now feminist game scholars organize international conferences, edit journals and scholarly collections, and shape trends in the profession, much as their counterparts in the digital humanities attempt to do, but critics in feminist game studies have been able to take advantage of what is seen as a relatively long trajectory of feminist theoretical inquiry and field development. Articulating a need for a feminist corrective in the digital humanities has come at a much slower pace, perhaps because the instrumentalism of a tool seems much less blatantly anti-feminist than the instrumentalism of a gun. Furthermore, calls to action from more radicalized forms of feminist approaches to science and technology studies have been noticeably absent in the literature around digital information retrieval in the humanities. This issue of DHQ indicates that a sea change may finally be taking place.  ",

        "abstract": " A part of the special issue of DHQ on feminisms and digital humanities, this paper takes as its starting place Greg Crane’s exhortation that there is a need to shift from lone editorials and monumental editions to editors ... who coordinate contributions from many sources and oversee living editions. In response to Crane, the exploration of the living edition detailed here examines the process of creating a publicly editable edition and considers what that edition, the process by which it was built, and the platform in which it was produced means for editions that support and promote gender equity. Drawing on the scholarship about the culture of the Wikimedia suite of projects, and the gendered trolling experienced by members of our team in the production of the Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript in Wikibooks, and interviews with our advisory group, we argue that while the Wikimedia projects are often openly hostile online spaces, the Wikimedia suite of projects are so important to the contemporary circulation of knowledge, that the key is to encourage gender equity in social behavior, credit sharing, and knowledge organization in Wikimedia, rather than abandon it for a more controlled collaborative environment for edition production and dissemination.

        "abstract": " Textual bricolage, the unacknowledged re-use of chunks of existing texts within a new composition, spans the liminal space between authorized, publicly shared, and de-authorized texts. While it can result in unique literary juxtapositions, bricolage also challenges the boundaries of authorial ownership. Understanding the methods and responses to textual bricolage reflects how a culture engages with textuality. Yet such study is often hindered by the sheer extent of compared texts. In this article we explore the potential of using Factotum, text similarity recognition software with visual interface, for analysing textual bricolage. Using examples from medieval and recent texts, we discuss different compilation techniques as well as the interaction between the notions of authorship, plagiarism and intertextuality.  ",

        "abstract": " With the growing volume of user-generated classification systems arising from media tagging-based platforms (such as Flickr and Tumblr) and the advent of new crowdsourcing platforms for cultural heritage collections, determining the value and usability of crowdsourced, folksonomic, or user-generated,  freely chosen keywords for libraries, museums and other cultural heritage organizations becomes increasingly essential. The present study builds on prior work investigating the value and accuracy of folksonomies by: (1) demonstrating the benefit of user-generated tags - or unregulated keywords typically meant for personal organizational purposes - for facilitating item retrieval and (2) assessing the accuracy of descriptive metadata generated via a game-based crowdsourcing application. In this study, participants (N = 16) were first tasked with finding a set of five images using a search index containing either a combination of folksonomic and controlled vocabulary metadata or only controlled vocabulary metadata. Data analysis revealed that participants in the folksonomic and controlled vocabulary search condition were, on average, six times faster to search for each image (M = 25.08 secs) compared to participants searching with access only to controlled vocabulary metadata (M = 154.1 secs), and successfully retrieved significantly more items overall. Following this search task, all participants were asked to provide descriptive metadata for nine digital objects by playing three separate single-player tagging games. Analysis showed that 88% of participant-provided tags were judged to be accurate, and that both tagging patterns and accuracy levels did not significantly differ between groups of professional librarians and participants outside of the Library Science field. These findings illustrate the value of folksonomies for enhancing item findability, or the ease with which a patron can access materials, and the ability of librarians and general users alike to contribute valid, meaningful metadata. This could significantly impact the way libraries and other cultural heritage organizations conceptualize the tasks of searching and classification. ",

Yet search — the dominant interface to these collections — is incapable of representing this abundance. Search is ungenerous: it withholds information, and demands a query.

Drawing on related work and precedents from information retrieval and visualisation, as well as critical humanistic approaches to the interface, this paper documents and analyses practical experiments in generous interfaces developed in collaboration with Australian cultural institutions.

This article situates debates over difference in the digital humanities within the context of the culture wars within the U.S. academy during the 1980s and 1990s, locating the stakes for diversity in the digital humanities. It surveys digital humanities projects, outlining the need for alternate histories of the digital humanities told through intersectional lenses. Finally, the article proposes ways of looking forward towards the deeper intersectional analysis needed to expand intellectual diversity in the field and move difference beyond the margins of the digital humanities.

Through interviews with digital humanities scholars and academic librarians within the Center for Institutional Cooperation, this study aims to explore some points of common perspective and underlying tensions in research relationships. Qualitative interviews revealed that, while both groups are enthusiastic about the future of faculty-librarian collaboration on digital scholarship, there remain certain tensions about the role of the library and the librarian. Scholars appreciate the specialized expertise of librarians, especially in metadata and special collections, but they can take a more active stance in utilizing current library resources or vocalizing their needs for other resources. This expertise and these services can be leveraged to make the library an active and equal partner in research. Additionally, libraries should address internal issues, such as training and re-skilling librarians as necessary; better-coordinated outreach to academic departments is also needed.  ",

        "abstract": " Academic writing has generally been understood as operating primarily within the linguistic modality, with writing remediating the voice of an educator or lecturer. Comics, by contrast, are more explicitly multimodal and derive much of their meaning from visual, spatial and linguistic modalities. Because of their multimodality, educational comics challenge the conception of an authoritative author’s voice, as is typically found in traditional educational and academic writing. To examine how authorship and authority function in multimodal educational texts, this paper examines several books in the popular For Beginners and Introducing series of graphic guides, which use images, text, and comics to summarise the work of major philosophers – in this case Derrida and Foucault. The books chosen for this study are all collaborative efforts between writers, illustrators, and designers. In each book, the collaborations function differently, engendering different divisions of authorial labor and forging different constructions of multimodal relationships between image, text, and design.  In order to more fully interrogate the ways that these educational comics combine multimodal modes of meaning, this paper itself takes the form of a comic, mimicking at times the books that it is examining. In this way, it serves as a self-reflexive critique of the idea that authorial voice is central to academic writing, and as an example of the challenges and opportunities presented by composing multimodal scholarship which eschews this conception of linguistic authorship.

        "abstract": " As the diversity of digital humanities practitioners grows, the need to construct a framework allowing for equal acknowledgement to all involved has become more evident. In this article, I argue that the perceived immateriality of scholarship privileges conventional academic labor over similar pursuits, such as data curation, resulting in them being glanced over and ignored in tenure reviews and job evaluations. To counter this, I create a theoretical framework that places materiality at the forefront. More specifically, I draw on and expand Gilles Deleuze's notion of assemblages, as outlined by new materialist philosopher Manuel DeLanda, to posit the idea of data assemblages, which are the result of digital humanities labor and consist of material parts contingent on their contextual relations and always in flux. I use the Digital Public Library as a case study and highlight how the reconceptualization of digital humanities labor moves beyond the merely theoretical to allow us to better understand the interdependency of individuals in the academic ecosystem and has broader implications for the nature of materiality in the digital age.

        "abstract": " For nearly its entire textual life Ezekiel 16 has barely survived. Early Jewish communities were wary of including it in their canon of sacred texts because of the chapter’s explicit and disturbing imagery. Christian communities have likewise wrestled with the text by essentially barring it from communal worship (the text does not appear in any lectionary) as well as nearly bracketing it in scholarship (most, if not all, scholars see the text as a violent and gross misrepresentation of gender roles as well as one of the most exacerbating cases of divine violence. Kathryn Phisterer Darr’s work stands out as one of the few that allows the tension of the text to stand.). Despite all of these objections, however, the text remains in the canon. In this one chapter of the Book of Ezekiel, one finds themes of hope, love, despair, suffering, betrayal, grace, and abandonment — all foundational to the human experience. In addition to a colorful theological tapestry, one also finds a definitively historical text that is troubling to most contemporary readers. Theology, history, and contemporary reader combine to make the text and its message shocking at best and inaccessible at worst; this project proposes a solution by way of sequential art. Because the theological message of Ezekiel 16 is both wrapped up in the larger narratival context and presents itself through forceful and explicit imagery, exegeting the text via sequential art offers the reader a new medium for understanding the text. I propose a retelling of the story found in Ezekiel 16 that consciously creates space for the theological themes, historical realities, and contemporary cultural concerns all to be heard and to stand in tension with one another. Along with a sequential retelling of the story of Israel and YHWH, I will also annotate my work to provide historical, artistic and scholarly perspectives for the reader. I will first create the comic by traditional pencil and ink and then scan the images. The images can then appear in any form needed.  ",

A first step shows the overall Amazon recommendation network for Digital Humanities and allows us to detect clusters, aligned fields and bridging books. In a second step we looked into four country-specific Amazon stores (Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr and Amazon.de) to investigate the specificities of the Digital Humanities in these four countries. The third step is a network of all books suggested for the Electronic Literature field in the four Amazon stores we searched, which offers a comparison to the field of Digital Humanities. ",

        "abstract": " This article describes a new method for inferring the gender of personal names using large historical datasets. In contrast to existing methods of gender prediction that treat names as if they are timelessly associated with one gender, this method uses a historical approach that takes into account how naming practices change over time. It uses historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was associated with a particular gender based on the time or place under study. This approach generates more accurate results for sources that encompass changing periods of time, providing digital humanities scholars with a tool to estimate the gender of names across large textual collections. The article first describes the methodology as implemented in the gender package for the R programming language. It goes on to apply the method to a case study in which we examine gender and gatekeeping in the American historical profession over the past half-century. The gender package illustrates the importance of incorporating historical approaches into computer science and related fields.Please see the lmullen/gender-article GitHub repository for the code used to create this article.

        "abstract": " This essay applies a digital humanities methodology to the study of digital media by framing software history as a problem of big data and textual criticism. While many scholars have already identified source code as an important site for the cultural study of software, this essay proposes that close reading is not suited to the scale and scope of modern application software. Applying text analysis tools to large bodies of source code can help address these problems as well as provide a basis for narrativizing its development and contextualization amidst a complex network of economic, political, and other sociocultural processes. Using source code produced over 15 years of development by the Mozilla foundation, this essay argues that software interfaces act as an extension of public relations narratives, often representing a developer's idealized version of their software which may not necessarily correspond with the state of the application's source code. Topic modeling Mozilla's source code allows us to explore a more nuanced narrative of development that shows how Mozilla has negotiated between the political ideals of open source software and the corporate ideology of its parent companies.

The comic first looks at comics criticism, visual rhetoric, and comics scholarship to set a base to build a methodology build in critical pedagogy and ancient rhetoric. Critical pedagogy’s tradition of inviting students to find meaning in the origin of ideas fits in with having students design and study a medium that’s often overlooked during their college experience. Such an approach echoes Freire’s ideas of using critical strategies as an effective model for change. Progymnasmata, and Quintilian’s work in general, allows students to approach the new medium of comics through reading and production through an ancient rhetorical practice that relies on a step-by-step process. Looking at Quintilian's pedagogy, we demonstrate a modern classroom study that uses progymnasmata to make the strange familiar while introducing visuality. The actual study is briefly discussed as well. This amalgamation of ancient rhetoric, comics studies, and critical pedagogy is the basis of the research behind this pieces’ goal of exploring comics as a multimodal means of composition.  ",

Our work addresses institutional concerns for outreach and engagement while also acknowledging and exploiting the inevitably incomplete or live character of archival collections.

The proposed methodology combines different kinds of expertise — including that of fans and scholars in both literary studies and computer science — in processing and sharing unique cultural materials. Working with a vast fan-curated archive, we suggest tempering scholarly approaches to the history of science fiction (SF) with fan perspectives and demonstrate how information visualization can be incorporated into humanistic research processes, supporting exploration and interpretation of little-known cultural collections.

        "abstract": " The article begins by asking why comics scholars should create comics as scholarship and traces possible answers through a variety of related fields: English, Rhetoric and Composition, Art, and Games. It then investigates the question of whether this article is itself a comic, by reviewing the history of the conversation about defining comics as an imitation of the Bayeux Tapestry. This tapestry section outlines the major camps, positions, and moves that comics scholars have made. The two major threads are the essentialist camp (with Kunzle, Eisner, McCloud, Harvey, Carrier, and Hayman and Pratt) and the constructivist camp (Meskin and Beaty). The section ends with Bart Beaty’s recent (2012) conceptualization of a comics world that does not need to define individual artifacts as being or not being comics. The article ends with a discussion of the importance of distinguishing definition from conceptualization. Building on Beaty’s conceptualization and Gilles Deleuze’s theory of the concept and critique of representation, it offers applications to the comics world. Finally, it returns to the question of whether or not this article is a comic. The answer (yes, and becoming something else), calls for further interventions throughout the comics world that don’t ask what comics are but what comics might become.  ",

The authors argue that the use of such rhetoric masks the hierarches that structure academic spaces, and that a shift to the digital does not eliminate these structural inequalities. Drawing on two surveys that assess student participation in DH projects (one for students, and one for faculty researchers), the article outlines the challenges currently faced by students working in the field, and suggests a set of best practices that might bridge the disparity between rhetoric and reality.

        "abstract": " Classifying and categorizing the activities that comprise digital humanities has been a longstanding area of interest for many practitioners in this field, fueled by ongoing attempts to define digital humanities both within the academy and in the public sphere. The emergence of directories that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries has also spurred interest in categorization, with the practical goal of helping scholars identify, for instance, projects that take a similar technical approach, even if their subject matter is vastly different. This paper tracks the development of TaDiRAH, the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities developed by representatives from DARIAH, the European cyberinfrastructure initiative, and DiRT, a digital humanities tool directory. TaDiRAH was created specifically to connect people with information on DiRT and in a DARIAH-DE bibliography, but with the goal of adoption by other directory-like sites. To ensure that TaDiRAH would be usable by other projects, the developers opened drafts for public feedback, a process which fundamentally altered the structure of the taxonomy and improved it in numerous ways. By actively seeking feedback from the digital humanities community and reviewing data about how the source taxonomies are actually used in order to inform term selection, the development of TaDiRAH provides a model that may benefit other taxonomy efforts.

The freely available Tesserae website (tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu) automatically searches pairs of texts in a corpus of over 300 works of Latin literature in order to identify instances where short passages share two or more repeated lexemes. We use Tesserae to survey relative rates of text reuse in 24 Latin hexameter works written from the 1st century BCE to the 6th century CE. We compare the quantitative information about text reuse provided by Tesserae to the scholarly tradition of qualitative discussion of allusion by Latinists. ",

        "abstract": " My paper contains original Word Processor Art compositions and an explanation of the theoretical grounding for my work. I compose visual images (comprised of words primarily taken from advertisements about the object they construct) in a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word). I break from the expected form of the Word Processor Document to scrutinize how machines, especially computer programs and the graphical user interface (GUI), influence the consumer's utilization of computers. In particular, my project questions how machines influence users' thinking and how the user-friendly inhibits creativity. The process disassembles the notion of user-friendly as a transparent influence and reveals how media shapes the author's imagination and creations. The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form of mechanical type to create concrete and, eventually, dirty concrete poetry. My work is inspired by these artists and the typewriter poetry they composed. My work also references art collective JODI's compositions and how our contemporary society resists the limitations of the GUI. My intent is to draw attention to the media of the composition. My work disobeys the prompts of the GUI to emphasize the idea that pre-packaged programs elicit conditioned responses and stifle genuinely creative uses of computing devices. Nietzsche writes that our writing tools are also working on our thoughts (quoted in ). My purpose in producing this work is not a rejection of computing or the GUI, but to draw attention to an interface’s existence and influence on its user. My work points to a creative space outside of conditioned responses to the GUI. ",

        "abstract": " The Almanac Archive, a project in its early stages of development, seeks to create a corpus of annotated British almanacs from 1750-1850. Cheap and useful, the almanac was one of the most commonly purchased and frequently read print genres during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By focusing on readers’ annotations in almanacs about everything from social engagements and weather to historical events and the breeding of livestock, The Almanac Archive offers insights into everyday life and ideologies of time. Creating a searchable, digital corpus of high-resolution images from annotated almanacs will encourage new research questions about the relationship between historical events, individuals’ everyday lives, and the materiality of Romantic-era interfaces for tracking time. By theorizing and sharing the ultimate goals and, indeed, challenges of the project even at its early stages, our aim in this paper is to answer Johanna Drucker’s call to pay [m]ore attention to acts of producing and [to put] less emphasis on product during the creation of an interface in order  to expose and support the activity of interpretation, rather than to display finished forms . In openly describing the unfinished form of The Almanac Archive and its relationship to current scholarly trends, we outline the technical and theoretical work going into its creation. ",

        "abstract": " In this paper we present a statistical method for inferring historical social networks from biographical documents as well as the scholarly aims for doing so. Existing scholarship on historical social networks is scattered across an unmanageable number of disparate books and articles. A researcher interested in how persons were connected to one another in our field of study, early modern Britain (c. 1500-1700), has no global, unified resource to which to turn. Manually building such a network is infeasible, since it would need to represent thousands of nodes and tens of millions of potential edges just to include the relations among the most prominent persons of the period. Our Six Degrees of Francis Bacon project takes up recent statistical techniques and digital tools to reconstruct and visualize the early modern social network. We describe in this paper the natural language processing tools and statistical graph learning techniques that we used to extract names and infer relations from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. We then explain the steps taken to test inferred relations against the knowledge of experts in order to improve the accuracy of the learning techniques. Our argument here is twofold: first, that the results of this process, a global visualization of Britain’s early modern social network, will be useful to scholars and students of the period; second, that the pipeline we have developed can, with local modifications, be reused by other scholars to generate networks for other historical or contemporary societies from biographical documents.

The project is undertaking two tasks: 1) the digitization of paper editions of fragmentary works linking them to the source texts from which the fragments have been excerpted; 2) the production of born-digital editions of fragmentary works. The ultimate goals are the creation of open, linked, machine-actionable texts for the study and advancement of the Classical textual fragmentary heritage and the development of a collaborative environment for crowdsourced annotations.

        "abstract": " Humanistic uses of digital technologies have opened up new ways to think about, communicate, and discuss historical research. The common use of digital tools to visually represent ancient cultures and sites, however, has also introduced new issues. For example, critics have argued that digital visualisations, largely synonymous with reconstruction in 3D models, often attempt to represent a photorealistic-artificial vision of the past, and may often prove to be a way to communicate history to a large(r) audience . Against this backdrop, this article will discuss precisely how technology may help immerse researchers into historically situated life, and radically advance historical research. Adding to related criticisms of ocularcentric traditions of knowledge production, we contribute to this stream of research by arguing that contemporary visual representations of the past often concentrate on visual representations and seemingly maintain antiquity as a sanitised historio-cultural ideal  . More specifically, this article seeks to demonstrate the potential of digital humanities to move beyond mere representations on screen and to mobilize other senses (specifically sound) as a historically situated component for research. For this purpose, we focus on the abstract principles and overall methodology for a recreation of the experience of sounds in the Roman amphitheatre. ",

        "abstract": " Coptic represents the last phase of the Egyptian language and is pivotal for a wide range of disciplines, such as linguistics, biblical studies, the history of Christianity, Egyptology, and ancient history. It was also essential for cracking the code of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Although digital humanities has been hailed as distinctly interdisciplinary, enabling new forms of knowledge by combining multiple forms of disciplinary investigation, technical obtacles exist for creating a resource useful to both linguists and historians, for example. The nature of the language (outside of the Indo-European family) also requires its own approach. This paper will present some of the challenges -- both digital and material -- in creating an online, open source platform with a database and tools for digital research in Coptic. It will also propose standards and methodologies to move forward through those challenges. This paper should be of interest not only to scholars in Coptic but also others working on what are traditionally considered more marginal language groups in the pre-modern world, and researchers working with corpora that have been removed from their original ancient or medieval repositories and fragmented or dispersed.

This article examines these platforms, and their protocols, as middleware that includes such purpose-designed projects as Omeka, and Scalar, and general purpose ones such as Drupal and PowerPoint, to ask how they embody rhetorical assumptions at every level of production (from back-end assumptions about what constitutes the smallest unit of discourse, to the front-end modes of presentation and organization of display). It extends the concept of middleware to include physical and social presentation spaces, activities (such as witnessing), to ask how these, also, perform the rhetorical activity of enunciation, positionality, and other discursive modalities.

        "abstract": " The Hellespont project (DAI, Tufts University) aims to structure the text of a passage from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides (1.89-118), in order to highlight events, persons and peoples that populate the world of the author and connect the different digital sources available for their study. Event annotation in the text in particular requires an in-depth linguistic analysis of morphology, syntax and semantics. However, the available resources for Ancient Greek do not provide adequate standards to support the encoding of semantic and pragmatic phenomena in Ancient Greek texts. In this paper, we discuss the motivation of the project and how we adapted the so called tectogrammatical annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank to identify the events and describe their structure. The linguistic notion of valency, which is central to tectogrammatical sentence representation, proves very useful for this analysis of Ancient Greek. ",

Through a specialized GIS course a small group of advanced undergraduate students learned how to interpret map data, create effective maps, and build map hypothesis - skills that are recognized as necessary for enhancing spatial thinking and thus spatial literacy. In the last decade GIS technologically has changed dramatically. The advent of Geospatial Semantic Web (Web 2.0) now makes it possible to integrate spatial thinking concepts at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum. This paper argues that spatial literacy must be more intentionally integrated into the Classical Studies curriculum and illustrates how we have begun to do that at DePauw University. ",

        "abstract": " Digital humanities scholars have made a tradition of problematizing our understanding of textuality through discussions concerning the design of information systems for texts that, in many cases, still look like books. This discussion is concerned with how creating opportunities for studying audio texts further complicates our understanding of the rationale of a textualized document, defined by Jerome McGann as the dynamic structure of a document as it is realized in determinate (artisanal) and determinable (reflective) ways. This discussion frames a rationale of audio text within the context of developing information infrastructures for accessing audio texts. I introduce a tool called ARLO that we have been developing in the High Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project (http://www.hipstas.org) for accessing and analyzing sound collections alongside new standards being proposed for the development of audio visual (AV) metadata and content models. The discussion concludes by considering what these interventions tell us about how a rationale of audio textuality helps us rethink rationales of text in digital environments. ",

        "abstract": " Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across disciplines that it has been regarded by  as one of the scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of the ancient texts — the so-called canonical citations (or references) — play a prominent role. The potential of these citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities. In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly, I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted citation network include the development of search applications and recommender systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the application of these network to the study of intertextuality and text reception.

Thenceforth – after analyzing the relationship between paper and body, relying notably on Derrida – this article will claim that we have the right and indeed, an obligation, to capture new covers and bindings. During the 17th century, in the lawless parts of the ocean, buccaneers realized that the right to depart was the condition for the capacity to be bound.

        "abstract": " In this paper we introduce the syntagm pragmatic modelling as a productive way of contextualising research in Digital Humanities (DH). We define pragmatic modelling as a middle-out approach (neither top down nor bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling techniques with an effective use of language. Furthermore, in order to elucidate a pragmatic understanding of model building, we reflect on texts (considered here as objects) and modelling (or strategy of analysis) in DH research (and teaching). This paper does not identify a new practice or approach; rather it offers an explanatory framework for existing practices. As the paper explains, this framework goes beyond existing ones and allows us to think about modelling in a more integral way. Drawing on this framework, we reveal how DH modelling practices challenge epistemological and linguistic restrictions, by, for example, problematising the adoption of terminology belonging to the domain of computer sciences. Reflections on metaphorical reasoning are used to exemplify how polarities and some rigidities DH research could find itself embedded in are overcome in practice. We conclude by advocating the importance of a diachronic and historical analysis of the role of metaphors in DH to further explore the relation between theory and practice as well as to develop models of modelling integral to DH research.

While new techniques are proliferating they still fall short of offering whole language experimentation. We provide a mathematical technique that maps words and symbols to ordered unique numerical values, showing that this mapping is one-to-one and onto. We demonstrate this technique through linear, planar, and volumetric visualizations of data sets as large as the Oxford English Dictionary and as small as a single poem. The visualizations of this space have been designed to engage the viewer in the analogic practice of comparison already in use by literary critics but on a scale inaccessible by other means. We studied our visualization with expert participants from many fields including English studies, Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Graphics. We present our findings from this study and discuss both the criticisms and validations of our approach. ",

        "abstract": " For the past century, the sciences have made terrific strides in capturing the public imagination. From dedicated television channels to online learning materials to science-related entertainment and educational facilities for families in practically every major city on the planet, the scale of public relations has been impressive and continuous. However, the same cannot be said for the Humanities. Although we certainly have cultural institutions for adults, ranging from art galleries to opera houses, their primary emphasis has been on providing opportunities for passively consuming cultural production, rather than with the core interest of the Humanities, which is in enriching objects of study by analyzing them through a variety of theoretical lenses. In this paper, I argue, as others have been doing for some time, that the Humanities need to learn in this respect from the sciences, in order to increase their public stature. Further, the driving force behind this education is Digital Humanities. Since public relations has been on the back burner for so long, this initiative is both important and daunting; it is one of the ways in which the Digital Humanities are strengthening the Humanities while at the same time encouraging them in a task that seems difficult enough that everyone wishes it was not necessary.

        "abstract": " These days, we are constantly looking for an image of ourselves in the historical past. “The first ever information revolution,” begins a typical book jacket blurb, “began with the advent of the printed book, enabling Renaissance scholars to formulate new ways of organizing and disseminating knowledge” . A communications scholar offers a view of our place in history that has echoes in countless other publications and presentations: “At present we are witnessing an information revolution whose significance parallels and perhaps even surpasses that of the information revolution caused by the printing press in the fifteenth century” . Publishers, both academic and trade, have created a new genre of book titles that confidently find the digital sizzle in the analog past: The Renaissance Computer (on printed books), The Victorian Internet (on the telegraph), Social Media: The First 2,000 Years (on letters, pamphlets, and graffiti). Scholars give talks with titles like Books as Social Media (Leah Price), Blogging Now and Then (250 Years Ago) (Robert Darnton), and What’s in a Visitor’s Book? Social Media and Volcanic Tourism in the Nineteenth Century (John Brewer). Surrounded as we are by these analogies — by these claims in favor of specific ways of construing the relationship between the past and the present, and by the significance claims that go with them — it seems fair to ask what purposes they serve. There is no doubt that we feel ourselves to be in the midst of a period of dramatic change in our media and information environments. My interest in this essay lies not in these environments themselves, but rather in our popular uses of historical metaphor to explain them. Why, in particular, do we turn to the rise of the printing press, out of all the options available, as our standard analogy for the rise of the internet? What value does this metaphor hold for us, what does it enable and what does it constrain, and what value does metaphoric thinking in general hold for analysis in media studies? It is as common for us today to use the printing press as a unit of measure in estimations of information history as it is for us to discuss our current circumstances in terms of an information revolution. But how historically accurate are these kinds of description? What do they mean for the ways in which we as futurists make use of history — and what do they mean for the ways in which we as historians take the long view?  ",

        "abstract": " The art history domain is an interesting case for search engines tailored to the digital humanities, because the domain involves different types of sources (primary and secondary; text and images). One example of an art history search engine is RemBench, which provides access to information in four different databases related to the life and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current paper, RemBench serves as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search engine that is geared towards the art history domain and (2) make recommendations for the design of user observation studies for evaluating the usability of a search engine in the art history domain, and in digital humanities at large. A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the combination of different source types is crucial in the art history domain. With respect to the user interface, both free-text search and facet filtering are actively used by the observed participants but we observe strong individual preferences. Our key recommendation for specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free text search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the user study shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines can successfully be evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a small number of participants. ",

One can now relatively easily participate in the building and implementation of a variety of digital products, such as mobile apps, that can then be used to study user experiences through interactions with rhetorical forms, including a variety of types of informatics. Our experiences in several projects that use both large- and small-scale mobile apps offer a critique and lessons learned directly from engaging in this type of field experimentation, including reflections on observations, survey responses, and other types of data collection made possible through this model. Four larger issues are addressed here, about conducting research through making apps, providing potential research paths, opportunities and challenges to consider. Perhaps most importantly, this research approach offers the ability to tailor an instrument specific to research needs and then test that instrument in a natural setting, affording a true sense of how people interact with their environments in real situations and real settings.

        "abstract": " Early modern printed books pose particular challenges for automatic transcription: uneven inking, irregular orthographies, radically multilingual texts. As a result, modern efforts to transcribe these documents tend to produce the textual gibberish commonly known as dirty OCR (Optical Character Recognition). This noisy output is most frequently seen as a barrier to access for scholars interested in the computational analysis or digital display of transcribed documents. This article, however, proposes that a closer analysis of dirty OCR can reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the practice of automatic transcription. To make this argument, it focuses on tools developed for the automatic transcription of the Primeros Libros collection of sixteenth century Mexican printed books. By bringing together the history of the collection with that of the OCR tool, it illustrates how the colonial history of these documents is embedded in, and transformed by, the statistical models used for automatic transcription. It argues that automatic transcription, itself a mechanical and practical tool, also has an interpretive effect on transcribed texts that can have practical consequences for scholarly work. ",

BHO is a digital library of key printed primary and secondary sources for the history of Britain and Ireland, with a principal focus on the period between 1300 and 1800. The collection currently contains 1,250 volumes, and 120,000 web pages of material. During a website rebuild in 2014, the project team asked its registered users about their preferences for searching and browsing the content in the collection. Respondents were asked about their current search and browsing behaviour, as well as their receptiveness to new navigation options, including fuzzy searching, proximity searching, limiting search to a subset of the collection, searching by publication metadata, and searching entities within the texts such as person names, place names, or footnotes. The study provides insight into the unique and often converging needs of the site’s academic and genealogical users, noting that the former tended to respond in favour of options that gave them greater control over the search process, whereas the latter generally opted for options to improve the efficacy of targeted keyword searching. Results and recommendations are offered. ",

        "abstract": " This article demonstrates the use of data mining methodologies for the study and research of social media in the digital humanities. Drawing from recent convergences in writing, rhetoric, and DH research, this article investigates how trends operate within complex networks. Through a study of trend data mined from Twitter, this article suggests the possibility of identifying a virality threshold for Twitter trends, and the possibility that such a threshold has broader implications for attention ecology research in the digital humanities. This article builds on the theories of Jacques Derrida, Richard Lanham, and Sidney Dobrin to suggest new theories and methodologies for understanding how attention operates within complex media ecologies at a macroscopic level. While many various theories and methods have investigated writing, rhetoric, and digital media at the microscopic level, this article contends that a complimentary macroscopic approach is needed to further investigate how attention functions for network culture.

        "abstract": " This article introduces the Seshat: Global History project, the methodology it is based upon and its potential as a tool for historians and other humanists. Seshat is a comprehensive dataset covering human cultural evolution since the Neolithic. The article describes in detail how the Seshat methodology and platform can be used to tackle big questions that play out over long time scales whilst allowing users to drill down to the detail and place every single data point both in its historic and historiographical context. Seshat thus offers a platform underpinned by a rigorous methodology to actually do longue durée history and the article argues for the need for humanists and social scientists to engage with data driven longue durée history. The article argues that Seshat offers a much-needed infrastructure in which different skill sets and disciplines can come together to analyze the past using long timescales. In addition to highlighting the theoretical and methodological underpinnings, Seshat's potential is demonstrated using three case studies. Each of these case studies is centred around a set of longstanding questions and historiographical debates and it is argued that the introduction of a Seshat approach has the potential to radically alter our understanding of these questions.

        "abstract": " This study examines the extent of the use of geographic code words in place of racial terms in daily news reporting. This is a case study of the only daily newspaper, the Toledo Blade, in the midwestern city of Toledo, Ohio. A data set was constructed by searching a nine year collection of Blade articles, available in full-text searchable format in a ProQuest database, that included the most frequently used directional terms and had specific street addresses (a total of 981 stories). Besides bibliographic data, each story was coded for its location and the general nature of the story. Street addresses were used to compile relevant census tract information on the proportion of minorities in each area referenced. These references were then plotted over a street map of Toledo revealing geographic distributions that do not relate to actual cardinal directions. Population data corresponding to each data point was then analyzed to show that directional terminology correlates with the concentration of minority population. Additionally, a comprehensive content analysis of all 21,667 Blade articles published in this period revealed racial differences in reporting. Such quantified observations are reinforced by examination of particular examples of racialized usage of geographic terms. ",

        "abstract": " There are a number of fruitful digital humanities approaches to cinema and media studies, but most of them only pursue traditional forms of scholarship by extracting a single variable from the audiovisual text that is already legible to scholars. As an alternative, cinema and media studies should pursue a mostly-ignored digital surrealism that uses computer-based methods to transform film texts in radical ways not previously possible. This article describes one such method using the z-projection function of the scientific image analysis software ImageJ to sum film frames in order to create new composite images. Working with the fifty-five feature-length films from Walt Disney Animation Studios, I describe how this method allows for a unique understanding of a film corpus not otherwise available to cinema and media studies scholars.

Drawing on the experience of the Pliny project, and recent work done within that project to explore how Pliny materials might connect with the semantic web, we explore ways in which structured graph-like thinking might be revealed in — to peek out from — parts of humanities research that is common to digital and non-digital humanists alike. Out of this, we propose a number of different ways that scholars might engage with the Semantic Web, and provide examples – arising from the building of a prototype extension to Pliny – of how these engagements could be dealt with. We also explore the challenge of ambiguity and incompleteness in scholarship, explain how 2D space operates in Pliny to cope, to some degree at least, with these issues, and consider the boundaries between the expressiveness of 2D space and the formal graph model of the Semantic Web. We end by proposing several possible avenues for future work that arise from our work so far. ",

        "abstract": " Exploratory studies have demonstrated the benefits of implementing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in literary and cultural-historical research. These studies have done much to affirm the power and flexibility of GIS technology as a resource for humanities scholarship. At the same time, however, these studies share a common limitation in that they tend to rely on the analysis of point-based cartographic representations. Such representations are suitable for modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are inadequate for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy constitutes a significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works of literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The present article proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how advanced spatial analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of historical works of travel writing and topographical literature. Specifically, the article explains how GIS, CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent spatial models of the journeys recorded in the works of three canonical eighteenth-century British travellers, each of whom composed influential accounts of their travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas Gray (1716–1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726–1798) and the agriculturist Arthur Young (1741–1820).

        "abstract": " A project is a basic unit of digital humanities (DH) scholarship, which suggests that DH as a discipline should pay more attention to project management, and perhaps to develop the project management models, principles, and methods that are more specific to the discipline. However, DH literature deals with this issue merely by listing the basic principles, or offering specific tips and tricks, which seriously simplifies management of DH projects. DH projects involve building (or at least using) digital tools, which brings the complex tensions between digital and humanistic aspects of these projects. In order to address such a complexity, there is a need for a model for managing DH projects that will learn from information studies and methods in software development, while still being based on values of the humanistic tradition and methods. This article combines a model of scholarly information practices with some concepts of agile software development into a hybrid model for managing DH projects. ",

First, we try to define what the process term could mean in the humanities; then we explain our choice of a representation; we also carry out tests of our method on selected case studies to visualize and question scholarly works. Last, we offer the reader a prototype that must be improved to produce automatic visualization of particular situations. ",

        "abstract": " James Patterson is the world’s best-selling living author, but his approach to writing is heavily criticised for being too commercially driven — in many respects, he is considered the master of the airport novel, a highly-productive source of commuter fiction. A former marketing professional, Patterson uses his business acumen to drive sales of his novels, which are largely written in conjunction with lesser-known co-authors. Using stylometry, this paper analyses the extent to which Patterson actually contributes to the writing of his novels, situating his process within the context of literary capitalism and the novel as a force of modernity.

        "abstract": " This article addresses the relationship of the disciplines of Modern Languages and Digital Humanities in Anglophone academia. It briefly compares and contrasts the nature of these disciplines – most frequently conceived of as either inter- or transdisciplines – before going on to examine in some detail the participation of Modern Linguists in Digital Humanities and that of Digital Humanists in Modern Languages. It argues that, while there is growing evidence of work that crosses disciplinary boundaries between DH and ML in both directions, more work of this sort needs to be done to optimise the potential of both disciplines. It also makes a particular case for Digital Humanities to remain open to critical cultural studies approaches to digital materials as pertaining to the discipline rather than focusing exclusively on more instrumental definitions of Digital Humanities. This argument is consistent with the concerns raised by other scholars with regard to the need for heterogeneity of approach and in particular for increased cultural criticism in Digital Humanities scholarship. Furthermore, we argue that this is where Modern Linguists can make their most decisive contribution to Digital Humanities research, offering what we term a critical DHML approach. We illustrate our arguments with a range of examples from the intersection of ML and DH in the broad field of Hispanic Studies, including the major findings of our own research into digital cultural production in a Latin American context conducted over the last ten years.

        "abstract": " This article describes the results of a case study that applies Neural Network-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scanned images of books printed between 1487 and 1870 by training the OCR engine OCRopus  on the RIDGES herbal text corpus  (in press). Training specific OCR models was possible because the necessary ground truth is available as error-corrected diplomatic transcriptions. The OCR results have been evaluated for accuracy against the ground truth of unseen test sets. Character and word accuracies (percentage of correctly recognized items) for the resulting machine-readable texts of individual documents range from 94% to more than 99% (character level) and from 76% to 97% (word level). This includes the earliest printed books, which were thought to be inaccessible by OCR methods until recently. Furthermore, OCR models trained on one part of the corpus consisting of books with different printing dates and different typesets (mixed models) have been tested for their predictive power on the books from the other part containing yet other fonts, mostly yielding character accuracies well above 90%. It therefore seems possible to construct generalized models trained on a range of fonts that can be applied to a wide variety of historical printings still giving good results. A moderate postcorrection effort of some pages will then enable the training of individual models with even better accuracies. Using this method, diachronic corpora including early printings can be constructed much faster and cheaper than by manual transcription. The OCR methods reported here open up the possibility of transforming our printed textual cultural heritage into electronic text by largely automatic means, which is a prerequisite for the mass conversion of scanned books.

        "abstract": " We propose that network visualization is a digital humanities method that can explore and negotiate the space between text and performance in the study of Shakespeare. The networks developed in this project use the language of Shakespearean plays to trace the relationships between characters in space, in effect, translating the literary text into a web of spatial relations, which are difficult to perceive solely in the act of reading. Our analysis presents a particular method of network visualization, and also demonstrates how this technique can be used as a critical tool to revise our understanding of social disorder in Shakespearean tragedy. We therefore propose a dual scope for this paper. At a methodological level, we argue that network visualization is a way to infer staging and the blocking of theatrical space from the language of the playtext. In our case study, we show how this technique can be used as a form of Shakespearean literary criticism deploying this method to reframe the larger question of social disorder in his tragedies. The network visualizations used in this analysis serve as a stable and reproducible way, beyond any single performance, to delineate how the language of Shakespeare’s plays structures the relationships of characters in space. This study represents the beginning of a digital method that aims to bridge text and performance in the study of Shakespeare by reading the dramatic text for the linguistic codes that organize the space of the stage.

With regards to the specific character of cultural heritage at the intersection of research, education, and public interest, the presented visualization environment aims at meeting the requirements of both researchers as well as a broader public. We present the results from a collaborative interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation, art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled with a more qualitative mode that allows for detailed examination of the artifacts and their contexts by displaying high-resolution views of digitized cultural objects with detailed art historical research findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the resulting visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of a collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and the feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the resulting prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of transferability of carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated visualizations of cultural heritage and raise questions concerning the applicability of our approach to related strands of humanities research.

This contribution focuses on thematic aspects of genre with a quantitative approach, namely Topic Modeling. Topic Modeling has proven to be useful to discover thematic patterns and trends in large collections of texts, with a view to class or browse them on the basis of their dominant themes. It has rarely if ever, however, been applied to collections of dramatic texts. In this contribution, Topic Modeling is used to analyze a collection of French Drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment. The general aim of this contribution is to discover what semantic types of topics are found in this collection, whether different dramatic subgenres have distinctive dominant topics and plot-related topic patterns, and inversely, to what extent clustering methods based on topic scores per play produce groupings of texts which agree with more conventional genre distinctions. This contribution shows that interesting topic patterns can be detected which provide new insights into the thematic, subgenre-related structure of French drama as well as into the history of French drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment.

It permits mounting of document images and offers page-by-page transcription and display, with the facility for project leaders to recruit and manage transcribers and other contributors, allocating and reviewing transcription work as it is done. Most distinctively, Textual Communities is built on a comprehensive model of scholarly editing, enabling both document (page-by-page) and work (intellectual structure, or entity) views of the texts edited. Accordingly, multiple texts of a single work, or part of a work (an entity) may be extracted and compared, using an embedded installation of CollateX. While completely conformant with Text Encoding Initiative guidelines, Textual Communities goes beyond TEI and XML in its ability to handle multiple overlapping hierarchies within texts. This paper will outline the thinking behind the development of Textual Communities, and show examples of its use by several major projects. ",

        "abstract": " The William J. Bankes Archive, Dorchester, is an impressive collection of original material concerning the archaeological, anthropological and natural heritage of Nubia and was amassed in the years 1815-1822. In the last two hundred years, many geo-human factors caused radical changes in the region. In a landscape almost untouched for centuries, the signs of the interactions between the ancient human communities and the natural environment were much clearer in Bankes’ times than now. Digital humanities offer powerful tools to manage and visualize large amounts of data and GIS in particular is an effective form of relational database, where all items of data have a position on the earth. This paper presents the methodology and the preliminary results of a research project that aims at a draft reconstruction of ancient Nubia based on the Bankes Archive. Archaeological, historical, natural history and ethnographic information extracted from the documents will be georeferenced in the GIS. Original maps, landscape views and epigraphic copies will also be made available on-line.  ",

        "abstract": " In this paper we intend to present a tool we developed for translation studies and diachronically compare various French translations of the Odyssey.  This field of study is part of the more general Classical Receptions studies that try to analyse the influence and adaptation of classical texts in modern and contemporary literature, theatre, cinema, and many other artistic fields. While Greek texts have been analysed by scholars for more than two thousand years, research about classical translations is not yet a most renown subject. In recent years this theme has raised a growing interest in the academic community.  We developed a program that can align textual sequences (defined as groups of words delimited by a specified grammatical pivot, in our case proper nouns), without need of previous training. We obtained alignments for many different kinds of translationsEven free translations, a problem that wasn’t generally considered by textual aligners since recent studies. While other programs have an upper bound for one-to-many alignments (for example with a maximum of four translated elements aligned to the same original element) this algorithm allows an indefinite number of alignments, both for the source sequences and the target ones. The aligner is based on an implementation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and on a string-based similarity approach to textual segments. The aligner needs to establish proper names as anchor words, as they are a relatively stable feature through different translations and tend to be similar in several languages.  Thanks to the alignments obtained using the program, we can explore translations in a number of ways. We will illustrate the creation of a graphical interface to visualize French Homeric translations.  With our tool, it is possible to highlight aligned portions of texts and show their immediate differences or similarities, both in meaning and in syntactic distribution.  We will show some resulting syntactic analyses carried out on a small sample of texts, taken from a corpus of twenty-seven unabridged French translations of the Odyssey and explore how the study of diachronic translations through algorithms of computational linguistics can produce interesting results for literary and linguistic studies.

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the archives of scholarly communication provide a suitable basis for conducting an assessment of broad fields such as German historians or German art history, with relatively low technical effort. For the initial analysis of H-Soz-KultFirst presented at the Historical Network Research Conference 2014 in Ghent., editorial practices facilitated the automated extraction of the speakers’ names as a key feature. But even in cases where no such special markup has been applied, freely available Web services such as AlchemyAPIAlchemyAPI Entity Extraction, http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/alchemylanguage/entity-extraction. provide methods that can be used to achieve comparable results.Thanks to Victoria H.

        "abstract": " This paper approaches Corinne, ou l'Italie through an inter-disciplinary lens, drawing on literary, historical, and digital methodologies. If Corinne is first and foremost a Romantic novel that foregrounds the love plot between Corinne and Oswald, it is as much a novel about the role of women in society, articulated through the figure of the femme de génie. The plot of the femme de génie finds its expression through the trope of sociability, which I analyze through a social network analysis of the characters in the narrative and a computational analysis of collocates. I argue that through the constellation of sociability in the novel and the national allegories that accompany it, Staël evokes an enduring partiality for an Enlightenment ideal of sociability that remains deeply connected with female emancipation. The lens of sociability thus allows for a re-articulation of the novel as a social critique of patriarchal society.  ",

        "abstract": " Since 2014, The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML) has partnered with professors and students around the world in a unique collaboration between a digital humanities (DH) project and humanities classrooms. The model we have developed addresses a sustainability challenge for DH projects, provides professors with a way of meeting administrative demands for engaged learning, and gives students a high-stakes research-based learning opportunity with the potential for an open-access, peer–reviewed publication. The MoEML Pedagogical Partnership Project emerged from a confluence of problems and opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH practitioners is project-based: how do we sustain the projects already begun? Another problem emerges as DH moves out of the big tent and sets up camp in humanities classrooms at smaller, non-R1 institutions. Also, for scholars not trained in the technologies that drive many DH projects, crossing the analog-digital divide might be daunting and discourage them from contributing to DH projects. To address these challenges, the MoEML Pedagogical Partnership takes Research-Based Learning (RBL) models and turns them into high-profile publication opportunities, mobilizing ubiquitous social networking and communication technologies to connect the project with the new demographic of student contributors. This essay will highlight how digital projects and digi-curious professors can collaborate to develop innovative pedagogical practices that provide projects with content, enliven professors’ pedagogy, and invite students to acquire scholarly research skills, gain digital literacy, and engage in an interdisciplinary and international collaboration. We argue that DH projects can be used innovatively and effectively in the classroom to promote RBL. At the same time, DH projects–open-access ones in particular–can provide a home both for humanities research and for the fruits of digital pedagogy across a wide range of institutional settings. ",

Digital projects and exercises allow students to engage with new technology, collaborate with peers, graduate students, and faculty, and produce tangible scholarship that is publicly visible. The Lab for the Education and Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR), a new student-focused digital humanities initiative at Michigan State University, has introduced digital components into large numbers of of History and Anthropology courses. Through two years of courses, it has proven fruitful to frame these not as Digital Humanities projects, but as part of a digital liberal arts curriculum that seeks to teach students not only about the domain-specific content, but also essential skills for information retrieval and analysis, media literacy, and communication in the digital age. This framework places these skills as extensions of longstanding skills, literacies, and knowledges that humanities and social sciences have contributed towards liberal arts education.  ",

        "abstract": " In the Fall of 2015, I was hired as contract academic staff at Wilfrid Laurier University’s Department of English and Film Studies to teach the foundation course EN245 The English Literary Tradition (Beginnings to 1660) for the first time as a course with a heavy DH component. My paper is a case study investigating the challenges of creating and delivering a partially online course in a university environment where the majority of teaching is done by sessional instructors whose labour is systemically marginalized by administration. Sessional instructors (or educational entrepreneurs) have even more limited resources (in terms of time, access to technical support, and access to administration) than tenure track faculty; however, open-access educational tools aren’t serving merely to level the playing field, but reshape it altogether as technical support and access to administrative support cease to matter in the delivery of an educational product. Today, many of the tools that are sufficient for the creation of a successful online or partially online course, whether generalist - iTunesU, Zotero, YouTube - or specialist - Google NGram, the University of Victoria`s Map of Early Modern London, Internet Shakespeare Editions - are freely available to instructors. Such freely available tools problematize the relationship between the instructor and the university insofar as universities tend to use proprietary systems (e.g. Desire2Learn) for everything, including data management, presentation, communication, and gradebook integration with the registrar’s office. Universities, in insisting on using these universal proprietary systems for every aspect of course delivery, exacerbate the disenfranchisement of sessional instructors, as access to the support required to become experts in these tools is limited and taken on at the instructor’s cost. A sessional instructor can create an entire course using freely available online tools, at minimal cost and reaching a tremendously large and diverse audience, yet cannot then market that course to any university that has a similar course as an educational product. At the present moment, the sessional instructor and the course are both subject to the curriculum of an individual university and department, despite the fact that courses with a heavy DH component tend towards portability, interoperability, and modularity that renders such boundaries largely incoherent. Though there are attempts to provide funding for courses that will bridge interuniversity boundaries such as the $4.5 million put forward by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities as a part of the eCampus Ontario initiative, such funding models largely exclude the sessional instructor, who cannot apply for funding as an educational entrepreneur. My paper will tell the story of how I tried to navigate a university system that tried to keep me from using free tools, while at the same time promoting my course as a part of the eCampus Ontario initiative.

In this article, we argue for explicitly employing a scholar-citizen model as a principle of pedagogical design, making explicit many of the latent assumptions of DH belonging and community. By adhering to these design principles we have been able to question some of the assumptions of pedagogical theories like Research Based Learning and public–facing scholarship, demonstrating these theories’ complex relationships public, semi–public, or private dissemination; classroom and non–classroom spaces; complexity of the assigned task; and the role of assessment. Our experiences as Director and Assistant Director for a combined Summer intensive undergraduate Field School in DH occasion this article.  ",

We analyze a pedagogical project that overtly set out to challenge structures of power and privilege in the undergraduate classroom through the use of an open-source online learning community. The Futures Initiative Commons in a Box site was developed and modified by the university faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students that make up the community of users. This learning community invites undergraduate and graduate students to become active knowledge-producers who contribute to their own teaching and learning. As such, the site works to increase students’ agency and reconfigure hierarchical relationships of power and knowledge. ",

        "abstract": " The question of how to model similarity between gestures plays an important role in current studies in the domain of human communication. Most research into recurrent patterns in co-verbal gestures – manual communicative movements emerging spontaneously during conversation – is driven by qualitative analyses relying on observational comparisons between gestures. Due to the fact that these kinds of gestures are not bound to well-formedness conditions, however, we propose a quantitative approach consisting of a distance-based similarity model for gestures recorded and represented in motion capture data streams. To this end, we model gestures by flexible feature representations, namely gesture signatures, which are then compared via signature-based distance functions such as the Earth Mover's Distance and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance. Experiments on real conversational motion capture data evidence the appropriateness of the proposed approaches in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. Our contribution to gesture similarity research and gesture data analysis allows for new quantitative methods of identifying patterns of gestural movements in human face-to-face interaction, i.e., in complex multimodal data sets.

        "abstract": " Despite the perceived newness of electronic methods in physical classrooms, electricity–and the distributed labor on which it runs–has long powered the spaces of pedagogy. Routing electronic practices in undergraduate teaching through the digital infrastructures with which they operate, this writing tests circuits of power that migrate between disciplinary and physical learning systems. It does so through a discussion of Pedagogy Toolkit, an open source and community-authored teaching repository built with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub Pages. Contributing to an increase of energy for project-based interventions in digital humanities teaching, Pedagogy Toolkit circulates digitized teaching materials, guides to teaching with digital humanities tools, a curated sample of online syllabuses accompanied by a syllabus templating tool, and an accessible website templating framework. An overview of new methods for digital teaching in the undergraduate classroom leads in turn to a reflexive discussion of the design of digital platforms as pedagogical objects, activating issues of labor, diversity, and knowledge transmission along the way. Ultimately, building a toolkit for digital pedagogy constructs infrastructure as a mode of intellectual inquiry, exposing classroom power as a conduit for ethical connections between students, teachers, and digital development teams. Rerouting logics that partition teaching practice and tool development, this article situates building communities at the heart of humanities learning. ",

        "abstract": " Recent years have seen widespread interest in digital humanities (DH) and growing interest in undergraduate-centered digital curricula. However, few undergraduate DH programs resemble those at large research institutions, where digital initiatives tend to be housed in graduate programs and rooted in graduate pedagogy or faculty research. Further, no two undergraduate DH programs are alike. This article seeks to move beyond graduate- and faculty-centered models by exploring new possibilities for undergraduate DH initiatives. It describes a workshop held at the ADHO DH2015 conference. This workshop brought together practitioners of digital pedagogy from small liberal arts colleges and from undergraduate centers within larger institutions. This article details the workshop’s exploration of undergraduate DH education, situating those practices in the context of broader trends in digital pedagogy. Finally, this article charts three broad challenges faced by programs which emphasize undergraduate digital curricula and offers suggestions and strategies to address these common issues. ",

Introducing DH in the academic programs at an undergraduate level can be a difficult path to traverse. Even so, for the academic year 2016, we managed to include a Specialized Seminar-Workshop on this field of study within the History Course at the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras at the UNAM. This article shows and analyzes the context, the methods and the academic, technical and specialization implications DH has in the History field (and in Humanities in general), and also presents the results of our teaching work, of the research project in teaching to which it is connected, and of some other activities which aim at establishing an academic digital culture in this School’s community.

        "abstract": " This essay presents an approach to teaching Digital Humanities through two largely unexplored lenses: electronic literature and foreign languages (Spanish in particular). It offers a practical example of a course taught during the Spring of 2016 at UC Berkeley that combines literary analysis with the teaching of basic programming skills, and DH tools and methods. Concretely, this course is an upper division, undergraduate writing intensive class, where students learn how to write and talk about electronic literature–e.g. hypertext novels, kinetic poetry, automatic generators, social media fictions, etc.–, learning specific terminology and theoretical frameworks, as they gain the skills to build their own digital art pieces in a collaborative workshop setting. By taking this course as a practical example, this essay tackles three important pillars in the humanities. Firstly, the overall concept of literature, and more specifically, the literary; secondly, what we understand by literary studies at the university; and thirdly, and more broadly, what constitutes cultural (beyond technical) literacy in the twenty–first century. This essay’s final claim is that teaching e-it as DH effectively address all three. ",

In light of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence with it through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community when they themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist, from reluctance to change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore, this article offers a selection of accessible DH methods that can be used to positively shape humanities pedagogy. ",

        "abstract": " The need for organising and digitally processing the vast amount of Cultural Heritage (CH) information has recently led to the development of formal knowledge representation models (ontologies) for the CH domain. Existing models, however, do not capture gender-related concepts. This article presents an effort to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered concepts in CH resources. The new ontology, named GenderedCHContents resulted from combined research in women’s studies, gender theory, and computer science. Its primary aim is to draw attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology extends the Europeana Data Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen object properties and seven datatype properties. The article presents a demonstration of the GenderedCHContents ontology’s use in five different representation tasks, which describe five resources related to Pandora’s myth. Lastly, the study stresses the benefits of reasoning support (i.e. enabling computers to infer further information from a set of asserted facts) in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships between metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the users.

        "abstract": " Digital technologies offer opportunities for engagement with cultural heritage resources through the development of online platforms and databases. However, questions have been raised about whether this type of engagement is structurally open or bounded by pre-existing institutional frameworks. Michel Foucault’s later work on governmentality speaks to this concern and identifies in modes of government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each,  to develop those elements constitutive of individuals’ lives in such a way that their development also fosters that of the strength of the state . This article takes Foucault’s insight as a point of departure for thinking about how digital technologies are mediating and structuring the relationships between individuals and organizations, using the European Commission-funded Europeana project as a case study. Europeana is the embodiment of all and each as a technique of government: it functions by fostering the contributions of individuals and national audiences in a way that celebrates their diversity, while also engaging in a project to systematically standardize and unify. Examination of the technical elements of Europeana reveals the political imperatives implicit in its technical operations, and how the parameters for audience participation are subsequently defined. In this article, we examine the audiences explicitly and implicitly delimited by Europeana, and then analyze them in relation to the project’s development of the European Data Model (EDM) for the interchange of metadata about cultural heritage objects. The article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about audiences, what Europeana is, and how its various parts work in concert constitute a definitional void. This void is a technique of government in that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague. It involves power relations that are hard to center and render visible, and it is thus difficult to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege. We suggest some tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to the sites of awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the technical framing of Europeana. ",

        "abstract": " This paper traces the little-known history of the London Stage Information Bank, a digital initiative that ran from 1970 to 1978 under the direction of Professor Ben R. Schneider, Jr. at Lawrence University. With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Mellon Foundation, Schneider’s team produced a database from the multi-volume reference work The London Stage 1660-1800 (Southern Illinois University Press, 1960-68). Today, however, most of the project’s outputs are lost or damaged, and its history has been largely forgotten in both theater studies and eighteenth-century studies. This essay traces the history of the Information Bank and my efforts to recover its damaged data and code, offering the project as an object lesson in questions of access, preservation, and institutional memory that digital humanities practitioners continue to confront in 2017. I argue that the project faded into obscurity, not only because of technological obsolescence, but also because the development team was unable to promote the kinds of research questions and behaviors that would enable their tool's widespread adoption and survival. The indifference of literary and theater scholars to the Information Bank throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s demonstrates how vital it is that digital and computational humanities work articulate its meaningfulness within existing intellectual and disciplinary traditions. While digital scholars build new avenues for inquiry that expand and transform humanities research, the survival of these approaches depends on their relationship to current humanities questions, methods, commitments, and epistemologies.

        "abstract": " Collaboration is an ethically charged relationship that challenges traditional modes of authorship attribution, institutional norms, and expectations of teaching and learning. A careful reflection on the needs and expectations of project participants demands an exposure of the seams and social dynamics inherent in research-driven relationships. In this paper, we ask: How does integrating digital scholarship into undergraduate pedagogy challenge systems of evaluation and credit and affect collaboration in research environments tuned to promotion and tenure? Emerging from our participation in the Scholarly Communication Institute (2015) in the Research Triangle of North Carolina, this article presents the findings of a team tasked with evaluating best practices and better understanding how authorship and contributorship models emerge in heterogeneous teams of students, faculty, staff, #alt-ac roles, librarians, programmers, and community partners.We have used the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) to describe our contributions to this article. Please find the full reference of activities here: https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/blob/master/reference/activities.md This taxonomy was brought to our collective attention at the 2015 Scholarly Communication Institute by the Modeling contributorship with TaDiRAH team, comprised of Cassidy Sugimoto, J.

        "abstract": " This paper describes a digital teaching application that approaches the study of language and literary works from a social semiotic perspective and represents an innovative pedagogical model for world language and literature classes. The Golden Age Literature Glossary Online, known by the acronym GALGO, consists of an online glossary of select keywords, from canonical texts of Golden Age Spanish literature, whose multiple connotations illuminate important linguistic and social concepts of the 16th and 17th centuries. GALGO incorporates British cultural historian Raymond Williams’ methodology in his Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society: namely, identifying problem-laden words or keywords, charting their distinct usages across texts, and reflecting critically on clusters of associated words. GALGO seeks to instantiate language as social semiotic by linking the semantic configurations of a literary work simultaneously to the cultural environment, the linguistic system, and the social system. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K. Halliday’s social semiotic model, GALGO’s interpretive apparatus provides the field of discourse or context of situation for the text in which a specific keyword appears. The field of discourse presents clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that describe the social action that is taking place in the text. GALGO also performs an interpretation of the tenor of discourse, highlighting sociological variables connected to class status, gender role and racial category that refine a keyword’s meaning from the perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally, GALGO adds commentary on discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar, syntactic nuances, and figurative language, that surround the keyword in the text. GALGO’s strength resides in the synchronic connectivity that the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of meanings for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the system has the ability to efficiently identify the absolute position of all uses of a keyword across multiple texts, so that large texts can be managed and search times minimized for both users and system administrators. GALGO is constructed in such a way that users can not only access existing analysis within the database, but also can assume, when instructed to do so, the role of the system administrator and contribute their own annotations. A team of faculty and student administrators are currently building the database with research previously collected in Spanish Golden Age literature seminars. Providence College students have utilized the social semiotic methodology underlying GALGO for several years now with successful outcomes both in terms of their growth as language majors and critical thinkers.

        "abstract": " While the massive and difficult task of finding, documenting, and centralizing collections is certainly of great concern to image archivists, and has been the motivating factor for beginning numerous digital humanities projects, strategies and best practices for archiving challenging or offensive visual objects (images that are non-canonical, violent, and ambiguous) remains under-theorized. Using the Pitt Rivers Museum, the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, Harpweek, the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and Visual Haggard: The Illustration Archive as case studies, I address the question of how digital image archivists ought to approach the task of curating objects with the potential to cause trauma. I bring together several critical strands–most importantly visual culture, race theory, and archival science–to question how the structure of a digital archive database might best achieve the goals of educating the public, supporting social justice, and enabling the researches of humanities scholars.

        "abstract": " The formally constrained work of the Oulipo (l’Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle, loosely translated as Workshop of Potential Literature) lends itself particularly well to digital studies, which was quickly recognized by the members of the group. To facilitate its goal of avoiding chance in its literary production, the group was naturally drawn to the determinism of computers, where true chance is simply impossible. In its early years, therefore, the group used algorithmic procedures as a starting point for various texts and also attempted to program these texts on actual computers, creating some of the first electronic literature and embarking on proto-digital humanities work as early as the 1960s and 1970s, later abandoning these efforts and relegating all subsequent activity to a subsidiary group. To understand the Oulipo's forays into computer science and more importantly, why they abandoned them, I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities. The goal was twofold: first, through exploratory programming, I intended to create interactive, digital annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation; more importantly, I hoped that by attempting to reproduce the Oulipo's own algorithmic efforts, I would gain similar insights into the nature of Potential Literature and be able to understand why the group abandoned such efforts after the 1970s. This article describes the content, development, and results of my project. For each of my three Python-based annexes, I offer a historical survey of the Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the Oulipo’s own proto-digital humanities experiments; then, I will talk about my own experiences as a coder-researcher, what learning Python has brought to my project, and how my exploratory programming offered me a new kind of critical reflection. Establishing these annexes forced me to learn to code, a type of work that does not only produce digital texts, but also helped me to reflect on the notion of chance in a more nuanced way. Finally, coding has allowed me to better understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital experimentation.  ",

We set out to solve a set of problems faced by many online cultural heritage collections. These problems are lack of accessibility, limited functionalities to explore the collection through browsing, and risk of less known content being overlooked. The object of our study is the Dutch Folktale Database, an online collection of tens of thousands of folktales from the Netherlands. Although this collection was designed as a research commodity for folktale experts, its primary user group consists of casual users from the general public. We present the new interfaces we developed to facilitate browsing and exploration of the collection by both folktale experts and casual users. We focus on the user-centred design approach we adopted to develop interfaces that would fit the users' needs and preferences. ",

In order to improve the indexing of historical collections, we map entities to the Linked Open Data cloud using a language-independent method. Our evaluation shows that MERCKX outperforms similar tools on the task of place disambiguation and linking, achieving over 80% precision despite lower recall scores. These results are encouraging for small and medium-size cultural institutions since they demonstrate that semantic enrichment can be achieved with limited resources. ",

        "abstract": " This study builds upon previous research that discusses gender and sexual identities and digital narratives by introducing a queer narratological approach to character creation mechanics. First, Lisa Nakamura’s identity tourism and narratological constructs are applied to formalize the concept of the exploration in digital narratives. Second, exploration of gender and sexual identities is demonstrated through a queer narratological analysis of two digital narratives, Always Sometimes Monsters (2014) and Hustle Cat (2016). Third, the development of character creation mechanics in The Sims (2000-2016) series is examined to reflect the advancement toward progressive game designs. Concerns regarding a sexuality blind approach and the downplaying of homophobia are addressed, and Helene Cixous’s poststructuralist other bisexuality as a transgressive product of the fluidity of identities in digital narratives is emphasized. This study elaborates the often-disregarded workings of queer narratology and theory in digital narratives or game designs. ",

This study attempts to compare book covers from different countries with a media visualization tool called ImagePlot. The top 100 bestselling books from 13 Amazon.com’s international sites were identified and their cover images were downloaded. Using ImagePlot, median values of brightness, hue and saturation for each image in the data set were extracted and analyzed. Along with one-way ANOVA tests and the resulting graphs from SPSS, ImagePlot outputs show differences in these graphical properties of bestsellers’ cover images in different countries. From the outputs, with all the book cover images displayed on a single canvas (screen), hidden patterns emerged and findings were clearly confirmed. This study makes a contribution by providing connection between research interests in book cover images and media visualization techniques for further research. ",

        "abstract": " Named Entity Recognition (NER), search, classification and tagging of names and name-like informational elements in texts, has become a standard information extraction procedure for textual data. NER has been applied to many types of texts and different types of entities: newspapers, fiction, historical records, persons, locations, chemical compounds, protein families, animals etc. In general, the performance of a NER system is genre- and domain-dependent and also used entity categories vary . The most general set of named entities is usually some version of a tripartite categorization of locations, persons, and organizations. In this paper we report trials and evaluation of NER with data from a digitized Finnish historical newspaper collection (Digi). Experiments, results, and discussion of this research serve development of the web collection of historical Finnish newspapers.  Digi collection contains 1,960,921 pages of newspaper material from 1771–1910 in both Finnish and Swedish. We use only material of Finnish documents in our evaluation. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of OCR errors; its estimated word level correctness is about 70–75 % . Our principal NE tagger is a rule-based tagger of Finnish, FiNER, provided by the FIN-CLARIN consortium. We also show results of limited category semantic tagging with tools of the Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo) of the Aalto University. Three other tools are also evaluated briefly. This paper reports the first large scale results of NER in a historical Finnish OCRed newspaper collection. Results of this research supplement NER results of other languages with similar noisy data. As the results are also achieved with a small and morphologically rich language, they illuminate the relatively well-researched area of Named Entity Recognition from a new perspective.  ",

        "abstract": " There has been much discussion about digital humanities (DH) both as a discipline and as a community of practice. This paper is based on my talk given to open the Leipzig eHumanities Seminar series and is presented here with many thanks to the organisers for their kind and generous invitation. Thanks also to the DHQ reviewers whose valuable comments have helped me to strengthen this paper. Whatever the balance of opinion, the emergence of digital scholarship in the humanities has undoubtedly had considerable impact on many disciplines; one such discipline is Classics and the study of the ancient world more generally. This article uses the Digital Classicist (DC) as an example of a DH community in a case study which traces its development and growth to examine what might be learned. As a community the DC joins together practitioners interested in the application of innovative digital methods and technology to the study of the ancient world (in its widest sense). How has this come about and perhaps more importantly, how has it been sustained and indeed provided the inspiration for other affiliated communities? What do we understand by a community and the association of individual practitioners separated by distance? It is important that members feel that they are stakeholders, that they have a sense of ownership and derive value from participation and contribution. It is argued here that a community could be seen as a symbolic and intellectual construct, one of perception rather than physicality to facilitate the exchange of ideas and so effect growth and strengthen the discipline.

        "abstract": " Interdisciplinary collaboration brings the benefit of multiple perspectives to a research project, yet it also provides opportunities for reflection on each discipline’s knowledge base. This article presents a case study in interdisciplinary collaboration between two disparate fields, web development and anthropology. We explore the challenges of translating between domains with differing values, aims and methodologies, as well as issues that arose for us during the development of a web application designed to provide a digital output of an ethnographic project. We consider our experience using the Agile style of software development, which emphasises rapid prototyping, iteration and even failure. In the long run, we find negative experiences in web development can be more valuable than the positive ones. The concept of ‘knowledge brokerage’ is a useful term to describe the collaboration between the academics – who were forced to conceptualise their data in new ways – and the developer – who negotiated these transitions between abstract information and binary data, and between academia and a public-facing web application.

The central question this article addresses is: Did Coca-Cola advertisements in Dutch newspapers communicate themes that represented the American way of life? Using two separate workflows, we demonstrate how we combined computational and traditional methods in an iterative and transparent manner. These workflows are systematic descriptions of how we used computational tools to answer this paper’s central research question. ",

        "abstract": " This paper analyzes the design space for crafting systems within games. A crafting system is the collection of game mechanics which enable a player to create virtual objects within a game, with examples ranging from making a pickaxe or placing blocks in Minecraft, to combining ingredients to create items in World of Warcraft, or designing a city in SimCity. Within both game design and game journalism there is no systematic understanding of what crafting means in games — rather, the term is used in an informal I’ll know it when I see it way, with different ideas of what constitutes crafting becoming conventional for different game genres. We aim to create a more systematic analysis and language for virtual crafting, using a design space approach where we identify seven features of crafting systems; any given crafting system is understood in terms of the degree and manner in which it exemplifies these features. The features we identify are: recipe definition (how well-defined are the player steps for creating a virtual object), fidelity of action (how detailed is the player-performed enactment of crafting), completion constraints (how is creation constrained by virtual resources), variable outcome (how much can the result vary when the player performs the same crafting actions), system recognition of outcome (to what degree do other game systems understand and take account of what a player has made), player expressiveness (how big is the creative space provided to the player), and progression (how do the possibilities of crafting change over time). We apply these dimensions to the analysis of 64 crafting systems across 47 example games. This more systematic analysis of the crafting system design space provides a deeper understanding of how games function as a creative and artistic medium for players, and provides a language and framework enabling scholars, critics and developers to more deeply understand existing crafting systems as well as unexplored opportunities for future crafting systems.

        "abstract": " The past twenty years have witnessed a mounting crisis in academic publishing. Companies such as Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, and Taylor and Francis have earned unprecedented profits by controlling more and more scholarly output while increasing subscription rates to academic journals. Thus publishers have consolidated their influence despite widespread hopes that digital platforms would disperse control over knowledge production. Open access initiatives dating back to the mid-1990s evidence a religious zeal for overcoming corporate interests in academic publishing, with key advocates branding their efforts as archivangelism. Little attention has been given to the legacy or implications of religious rhetoric in open access debates despite its increasing pitch in recent years. This essay shows how the Protestant imaginary reconciles–rather than opposes–open access initiatives with market economics by tracing the rhetoric of openness to free-market liberalism. Working against the tendency to accept the Reformation as an analogy for the relationship between knowledge production, publishers, and academics, we read Protestantism as a counterproductive element of the archivangelist inheritance.

        "abstract": " In the emerging field of digital style analysis, scholars have been dwelling on a perceived irreconcilability of distant reading and close reading . This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the paradigm wars in social science, where for years, one could either adhere to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset. Taking seriously both the hermeneutic and the empirical traditions of (digital) stylistic research, the present paper proposes a mixed-methods coalition of approaches. To establish links between the mixed-methods paradigm from Social Sciences  and stylistic practices within Digital Humanities (DH), the present article discusses common methods of distant, close, and ‘scalable reading’ as well as a flexibly adjustable definition of style . In the practical part of the paper, I report a ‘mixed-methods digital stylistics’ study on Franz Kafka’s prose. Scaling the degree of abstraction and contextuality of the data according to particular research questions, I combine (1) quantitative hypothesis testing (examining Kafka’s stylistic uniqueness by means of a stylometric measure); (2) quantitative exploration (analyzing the first hundred statistically overrepresented words in Kafka); and (3) qualitative text analysis (KWIC and close reading to investigate the functions of a particular style marker in the context of Kafka’s The Judgment [Das Urteil]). Generally, for digital stylistics, I propose (a) raising epistemological and methodological awareness within the field, and (b) framing the research within the mixed-method paradigm that in fact seems very well suited to DH.

        "abstract": " We investigate what distinguishes reported dreams from other personal narratives. The continuity hypothesis, stemming from psychological dream analysis work, states that most dreams refer to a person’s daily life and personal concerns, similar to other personal narratives such as diary entries. Differences between the two texts may reveal the linguistic markers of dream text, which could be the basis for new dream analysis work and for the automatic detection of dream descriptions. We used three text analytics methods: text classification, topic modeling, and text coherence analysis, and applied these methods to a balanced set of texts representing dreams, diary entries, and other personal stories. We observed that dream texts could be distinguished from other personal narratives nearly perfectly, mostly based on the presence of uncertainty markers and descriptions of scenes. Important markers for non-dream narratives are specific time expressions. Dream texts also exhibit a lower discourse coherence than other personal narratives. ",

        "abstract": " This article presents a new model for emotion mining, resulting from the research project Embodied Emotions. This project aims: 1. to trace historical changes in emotion expression and in the embodiment of emotions, and 2. to develop methods to trace these changes in sizeable corpuses of digitized texts. Up to now, the mining of sentiments or emotions has mainly been restricted to modern, or even very recent text corpora, such as social media. Sentiment mining techniques are often based on relatively simple emotion models of binary (positive/negative) oppositions, or limited sets of ‘basic’ emotions and are not yet able to deal adequately with the complexity and the historical contingency of emotions and their expression. To meet these challenges, we have developed the Historic Embodied Emotion Model (HEEM), built on a test case of 29 Dutch language theatre plays written between 1600 and 1800 and annotated manually with HEEM labels for emotions and body terms. In this article, we present this model and compare it with other sentiment mining techniques: 1) off the shelf linguistic analysis software LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), 2) a version of LIWC that has been adapted for the analysis of Dutch historical texts, 3) a new Dutch translation of WordNetAffect. We conclude that, although different forms of sentiment mining have their value and use, HEEM provides new opportunities for emotion mining and analysis of embodied emotions in historical texts. ",

We discuss the theoretical grounds for a collection of technological forecasts, at a time when they are largely considered ephemera. We also discuss how tracking the telepathic sublime as a dynamically evolving popular communication phenomenon requires a unique, humanities-based metadata scheme and archival practice. ",

This is a resource-intensive effort necessitating a scalable workflow centered on continuous curation of these texts, from both within and outside the PDL/OPP ecosystem. Key requirements for such a workflow are ease of maintenance and speed of deployment of texts for use by a wide variety of analytical services and user interfaces. Drawing on software engineering best practices, we have designed an architecture meant for continuous integration with customizable services that test individual files upon each contribution made to our public git repositories. The services can be configured to test and report status on a variety of checkpoints from schema compliance to CTS-ready markup designed for flexibility and interoperability. ",

        "abstract": " Collaboration has become a hallmark of Digital Humanities (DH) research. Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g.  ), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3) machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and disciplinary preconceptions are challenged. ",

        "abstract": " Discussions of digital humanities pedagogy have often focused on discussions of scaffolding and play (alternatively, tinkering) approaches, and methods for assessing student work appropriate to both techniques. While these approaches may seem oppositional, we emphasize the need to balance them in most classroom contexts, and explore challenges with integrating new digital humanities platforms in topically-driven humanities classrooms. We examine our experiences as an instructor and a librarian partnering to include a multimedia publishing assignment sequence in a course on the history of children’s literature, and our assessment of our approach to instruction in a distance graduate education context that is not amenable to the lab-based learning usually used in person for DH learning. While discussions of assessment of DH classroom projects generally focus on the question of how to grade student work, we argue that assessment is as important for reflecting on and evaluating pedagogy, including how to balance and iteratively improve scaffolding and play approaches. These issues are important not just for experienced DH instructors, but also humanities instructors without a DH background beginning to integrate digital assignments as a new norm. ",

        "abstract": " This study used three interdependent techniques to help understand the use and distribution of syllabic values of the cuneiform signs during the second half of the third millennium and early second millennium BCE. The results suggest that, during this period, cuneiform syllabaries were variable. That variation can further inform us about the regional, temporal, and dialectical contexts in which they existed. The addition of this research to the wider literature on the early adaptation of cuneiform enhances the field's understanding of how cuneiform syllabic values began to emerge and spread across the ancient Near East, and demonstrates how computational methods of analysis can be applied to research questions in humanities subjects.

        "abstract": " Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (Part I, 1791; Part II, 1792) is one of the most influential political tracts ever written. Recently, Clark (2015) has queried the long-established notion that Part I is the work of a single author, Paine himself. Clark argues that a passage of approximately 6000 words just prior to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizens, near midway through the book, was written by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and inserted by Paine into his book, perhaps with some editing. Clark's assertion rests mainly on judgement of the tone and content of the queried passage, as well as a hint in a letter by Lafayette to George Washington. This paper presents the results of a stylometric study of this question. Three computational approaches to stylistic analysis — one involving a consensus of six attribution techniques — were applied to the text of the Rights of Man, Part I, along with a corpus of comparison texts from the same period. Our findings tend to corroborate Clark's contention, as well as identifying two other short passages in which Lafayette may have had a hand, thus rendering this important document ripe for re-interpretation.

        "abstract": " The William Blake Archive emphasizes accuracy and objectivity. The photographed or scanned images are made faithful to their original objects in scale, color, and detail. The editors’ notes are largely bibliographic and informative. The illustration descriptions consist of precise observations deliberately void of interpretation. The transcriptions are as diplomatic as the digital medium allows. And the explicit relationships between objects in the Archive are material; one can see, for example, copies of prints from the same relief-etched copper plate, or a design carried from a water color drawing to an engraved illustration. The scholar must be free to make his or her own interpretations. Since beginning to redesign the back end and front end of the site, the editors and staff have realized that more kinds of relationship might be made explicit. The challenge has been to decide which ones conform to our emphasis on accuracy and objectivity. In a neutral presentation of art and its contextual information, we can’t tell the scholar that object X relates to object Y because they embody the same theme. That would impose on him or her our own interpretation. But we can say that X relates to Y because they contain some of the same text.  In this paper we discuss the difficult task of digitally presenting more kinds of relationships in the Archive while staying objective. We explain how the task has compelled us to reevaluate Blake’s methods and reencode the connections amongst his works accordingly. We describe planned enhancements to our tools used for representing and displaying these connections--enhancements that would benefit all archives, not just the Blake Archive. And finally we gesture towards further research into the philosophical context of Blake's practice of making related art and into the idea of relationship in archives in general. ",

        "abstract": " Even if digitized and born-digital audiovisual material today amounts to a steadily increasing body of data to work with and research, such media modalities are still relatively poorly represented in the field of DH. Streaming media is a case in point, and the purpose of this article is to provide some findings from an ongoing audio (and music) research project, that deals with experiments, interventions and the reverse engineering of Spotify’s algorithms, aggregation procedures, and valuation strategies. One such research experiment, the SpotiBot intervention, was set up at Humlab, Umeå University. Via multiple bots running in parallel our idea was to examine if it is possible to provoke — or even undermine — the Spotify business model (based on the so called 30 second royalty rule). Essentially, the experiment resembled a Turing test, where we asked ourselves what happens when — not if — streaming bots approximate human listener behavior in such a way that it becomes impossible to distinguish between a human and a machine. Implemented in the Python programming language, and using a web UI testing frameworks, our so called SpotiBot engine automated the Spotify web client by simulating user interaction within the web interface. The SpotiBot engine was instructed to play a single track repeatedly (both self-produced music and Abba’s “Dancing Queen”), during less and more than 30 seconds, and with a fixed repetition scheme running from 100 to n times (simultaneously with different Spotify Free ‘bot accounts’). Our bots also logged all results. In short, our bots demonstrated the ability (at least sometimes) to continuously play tracks, indicating that the Spotify business model can be tampered with. Using a single virtual machine — hidden behind only one proxy IP — the results of the intervention hence stipulate that it is possible to automatically play tracks for thousands of repetitions that exceeds the royalty rule.

This study (1) summarizes the feedback of dozens of technologists, manuscript experts, and curators obtained through survey data and workshop focus groups; (2) provides a state of the field report which assesses the current tools available and their limitations; and, (3) outlines principles to help guide future development. The authors in particular emphasize the importance of producing tool-independent data, fostering intellectual trading zones between technologists, scholars, librarians, and curators, utilizing a code base with an active community of users, and re-conceptualizing tool-creation as a collaborative form of humanistic intellectual labor.

The project developed and tested methods for automatically creating meaningful links and expanding archival television data. In the project, a high level of collaboration was required between scholars from two different disciplines: computer sciences and media studies. The majority of the epistemological encounters between the two disciplines took place in the design of the developed tools and the user studies to test the tools. The article is based on structured conversations between the two central staff members in the project, i.e. the computer science PhD-student and the media studies postdoctoral researcher. By unravelling the research project as a process of confrontation, identification and acknowledgement of situated knowledges, the article shows when and how the boundaries between the two disciplines have been maintained, crossed and blurred. The authors point to the benefits and challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration in the Digital Humanities, and formulate some best practices for future Digital Humanities-projects. ",

Using BigDIVA.org as an example of networked browsing, this paper presents the results of a small usability study that compared how participants (N = 8) engaged with BigDIVA’s networked browsing in comparison to use of a search engine such as Google. In doing so, we situate our study within performative conceptualizations of human-computer interfaces  in order to explore the potential becomings when human and nonhuman machinic component are entangled together. Based on the observations from our usability study, we argue that networked browsing is suggestive of Whitelaw’s (2015) generous interfacing that emphasizes browsing as a tool for exploring relationships between nodes in archives, as well as Shneiderman’s (1996) joyous experience for interfacing with the web.

        "abstract": " Digital humanities have a long tradition of using advanced computational techniques and machine learning to aid humanistic enquiry. In this paper, we concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called predictive analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive analytics has evolved from descriptive analytics, which creates summaries of data, while predictive analytics predicts relationships within the data that also help to explain new data. Predictive analytics uses machine learning techniques but also traditional statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict another target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of features make the target more or less likely. Predictive analytics can thus be considered to be a technique to machine-read data. The paper discusses the background of predictive analytics, its use for predicting the past and finally presents a case study in predicting past gender relations in a historical dataset. Predicting the past is introduced as a method to explore relationships in past data. ",

Commissioned two decades ago by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the work is just back on view to the public after a major restoration. It seems timely to consider Cheang’s artwork: a collaboration between the artist and a network of programmers, designers, authors and other contributors that offers a creative platform for remembering and engaging with histories and issues of identity from the LGBTQ+ community. In the spirit of the piece, this article is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between a curator, a media art conservator, a computer scientist, and a scholar of the digital liberal arts, which brings together these different areas of expertise to offer an innovative and multi-faceted consideration of one artwork from a digital humanities perspective.

In fact, starting as early as 1949, he collaborated with IBM to perform experiments using suites of punched-card machines. These punched-card data systems—with their plug-board setups, clacking machinery, and flurries of perforated rectangular cards—were developed for business accounting and tabulating, and adapted for government censuses, defense calculations, archival management, and information processing of all kinds. The first decade of humanities computing can more accurately be described as an era of humanities data processing—in the historically specific and contextually rich sense of the term. This essay describes an ongoing collabroative project that aims to reverse engineer that center in the attempt to understand better this important site in the history of technology and humanities computing.

        "abstract": " The fate of the medieval Aesop during the early age of print reveals the tensions that arise between corporeal and proprietary understandings of artistic production. Building upon the highly accumulative, various, and expandable Aesopic tradition that thrived in the Middle Ages within scholastic manuscripts, the fifteenth-century fables of Robert Henryson and William Caxton confront movements to consolidate and transform Aesop’s sprawling literary corpus into a singular printable property. At the same time that a single series of Aesop’s fables, now known as the elegiac Romulus, became increasingly standardized within printed books, woodcut illustrations and textual descriptions increasingly beautified Aesop’s body, transforming him from an inarticulate slave to an eloquent aristocrat. The simultaneous metamorphosis of Aesop’s poetic and visual corpus reveals the premodern underpinnings for current efforts by publishing industries to immunize digital work from rogue acts of appropriation, mashup, and remix, practices which had previously defined Aesopic textuality. As a response to this textual vulnerability, the collapse of Aesopic work into a singular entity reimagines the allegorical relationship between the author or publisher and the work as proprietary, not corporeal. Rather than an extension of a generative, deeply somatic, and grotesque process of multiple fabular authors and commentators, the modernized Aesop obtains value as a property, paving the way for the notion that creative corpuses can be owned, effectively stealing away corporeal features from intellectual production.

        "abstract": " The history of human-environment interaction is embedded in stone. Stones are essential components of daily life and their various usage characterize certain areas or chronological periods. The form of a stone object is the result of a long chain of interactions with distinct bodies but the intangible life story of any artefact is partially registered in its original material properties and gradual physical alteration. Digital systems can be adopted for collecting these invisible records and tracing a stone’s history. Chemical imaging and portable spectroscopy are quick and non-destructive remote sensing techniques that can be used to gather empirical data and track production and use of stone artefacts over time. This article reviews the application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy as a method for geochemical characterization of objects and as a tool for provenance studies within the Mobima project, carried out by an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists and chemists at University of Umeå, Sweden. Near Infrared Spectroscopy can be used for acquiring and processing spectral information directly in the field, modelling datasets of big assemblages and classifying objects. Making stones’ biographies visible will help understanding the entanglement of past societies and their geological landscapes. ",

        "abstract": " Over the past decades the advancement of technology and its subsequent introduction to the humanities has led to the development of several applications that enhance study and research in areas such as Classics, archaeology, epigraphy, and linguistics. The focus of digital humanists and other humanities scholars has turned to the efficient storage of information that facilitates search, comparative studies, accessibility, and consequently research. The common point of reference for the aforementioned applications is that they do not involve the need for the scholar to physically be in a virtual space. In areas, such as archaeology and epigraphy, the creation of projects that provide access to 3D models of the artifacts as well as to virtual replications of ancient sites has resulted in the opening of new areas of research and reconsideration of traditional research issues. Also,  argue that digital visualizations may make the ancient world more accessible to a larger audience. One may comprehend the structure of a vase and analyze its artistic patterns by zooming and relighting it. A problem that is yet to be considered, though, is how a scholar and a student are to perceive Classical drama, the theatrical space, the distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the logistics of the performance, and the cultural aspects at play. This paper discusses the importance of experiential learning and the use of virtual reality as a means of promoting traditional edification methods, virtually recreating the actuality of the stage, and presents the Magic Mirror Theater, a web application designed to facilitate the study of Classical drama.

        "abstract": " With the increasing proliferation of digital technologies into our daily routines, long-standing debates have resurfaced on the potential of prosthetic devices to extend our cognitive capacities and distribute intelligence across human and non-human agents. This article will propose ways in which we, as educators, can harness the distractions that new technologies can pose to teaching and research towards productive models of distributed attention and collective intelligence. By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through critical theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and collaborative learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of Digital Humanities that Holly Willis terms as the cinematic humanities. Remixing, recontextualization, and the non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us with new modes of distributed attention and critical making in the digital age. This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative projects for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses (adjustable to other subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social and locative media, and augmented reality into experimental modes of connected and collaborative learning. The first assignment is a live film scoring remix, where students collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks to early silent films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new ways of using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information System) and AR (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to civic engagement and local/online activism. The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital humanities should or should not be, and other issues that often undermine the potential contributions to digital humanities that derive from the intellectual and material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and distributed classroom. The remix aesthetic, the unfinished and makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to this kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the digital humanities and other disciplinary cross-pollinations.

        "abstract": " Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this paper argues that annotation software provides students with the opportunity to perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates knowledge transfer and encourages intersectional critical approaches to texts. As hypertext editions and online reading communities have proliferated, scholars have theorized that these layered, interactive modes of reading produce distracted readings of texts, especially in pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however, researchers and students have the opportunity not just to consume these distracted readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation software assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students than simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to annotate a particular text, students’ distributed modes of attention are re-focused on the text itself, pulling disparate threads of thought together. ",

        "abstract": " Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This loose hold on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a true distraction, and managed accordingly.  In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text, image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholar’s understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes tenuous, and largely undiscovered. This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of epistemic emotions as a valid research input, but also to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment might be and how to get below the level of that work.

        "abstract": " Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, but this is heightened in the contemporary moment both because of the way the environments in which we read are changing so radically. For Katherine Hayles reading is  a powerful technology for reconfiguring activity patterns in the brain , a view representative of attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading with age old practices of literary endeavour. For Sven Birkerts, however,  the Internet and the novel are opposites , a view that suggests that a hierarchy of reading that locks digital readers out of higher order thinking and literary experience. Meanwhile, Anne Mangen finds that electronic reading environments  negatively aﬀect emotional aspects of reading . But these approaches tend to understand reading as something static that occurs in one space or another. However, in practice our reading is increasingly distributed. Reading can occur in multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the one text or reading experience. A novel begun in print can be read online in a born-digital format and concluded in a scanned digital format, for example. These journeys across platform require deeper investigation. If we think of the printed book as an interface between two orders of thinking, we need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized version of a formerly printed and bound book alters literary reception and student experience. How does the experience of reading across different technological platforms change the reader’s relationship to the content? As more and more electronic reading platforms take on the physical attributes of material reading experiences either by retaining material traces or by emulating them, we might question what experience How do the material traces left on digitised works impact the reading process for reading in literary studies? The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the material into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats and interfaces, raises valuable questions about the future of the book, reading in the twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that centuries of material text production casts over Google Books’ electronic utopia. This paper uses both book history and new media interface theory to consider the multitude of diverse experiences that is literary reading across different platforms in and out of the classroom and to consider whether distracted reading can be better understood as distributed reading. It considers critical infrastructure studies as a useful framework through which to think about reading in the digital age. ",

        "abstract": " The advent of handheld digital devices has proved to be revolutionary for the teaching of art history. They make it possible to supplement, even replace, the traditional format of lecturing and communal viewing of a single screen. On their personal screens, students can enter a searchable world of thousands of virtual images: what the radical art theorist and novelist André Malraux, more than half a century ago, called the imaginary museum. For several years, I have been experimenting with my art history classes, showing my students how to use their laptops, tablets and phones to become active viewers and collaborators. Multiple virtual images transform the content, as well as the environment, of learning art history. Rather than being restricted to the illustrations in a textbook, students can use their devices to engage with online image sources such as museum websites, image databanks, and auction houses. Portable digital technology can turn the art history classroom into a collaborative and dynamic experience inconceivable a short time ago. Malraux himself, who believed in the power of art to transcend time and space, might be amazed at what is now not only possible, but commonplace. ",

        "abstract": " In this essay, I examine the use of laptops in the classroom through the lens of boredom. Now that we can carry around an incredibly powerful little computer in our pockets or bring a lightweight laptop to class, boredom is a feeling that we almost never have to face anymore. We instantly alleviate the slightest hint of impatience or aimlessness with a single glance at our screens. But what introspective capacities do we neglect when we reflexively give ourselves over to the distractions of the outside world? What might dwelling within our boredom open up to students? Using my undergraduate Introduction to Digital Media course as a case study, I argue that a humanistic approach to digital media provides STEM students in particular with a means of contextualizing technical detail within larger sociopolitical systems, and that a focus on individual habits of attention can provide an important hinge between the granular and the global. Next, I reflect on the pressures produced by the very devices we studied on the classroom environment, and frame our experiences within some of the most influential writings on boredom as a historically and technologically conditioned mood. I then conclude with some speculations on planning for boredom within a laptop policy that is capable of accounting for a range of learning styles.  ",

It reports on courses taught at NC State University and elsewhere which use digital humanities pedagogy under the aegis of studying transformations in reading. With attention to the mediation of attention itself, these courses can cultivate habits of self-reflection to aid students in any disciplinary pathway. Furthermore, digital humanities pedagogy can offer a transferable project-based model of instruction, helping students to develop metacognitive skills as well as to acculturate to different environments across campus. Ultimately, this essay underscores the need to articulate strategies of educational transfer in digital pedagogy. ",

We propose that new technologies may be used to engage the other senses in the act of reception, and specifically here we focus on kinaesthesia, or the sense of self-movement.

It was necessary for the performers to develop a range of translational strategies in order to communicate their movement to the system, entailing what we term distributed reception, in which the ultimate recipient of ancient source-material is not a human actor but rather the machine with which s/he is in collaboration.

        "abstract": " This paper proposes a new listening methodology that lies, in some sense, between Charles Bernstein’s close listening and Tanya Clement’s distant listening. While it’s tempting to think of these approaches as presenting an integral of scope, Bernstein’s work proposes the use and tuning of the human ear for understanding the sonic materiality of the phonotext, while Clement’s work, following its namesake of Moretti’s distant reading, calls for a form of surrogate listening — using the machine in place of the ear. Building on Bernstein’s work and toward Clement’s, I suggest Machine–Aided Close Listening as a methodology that uses data visualization as a prosthetic extension of the ear. This is to say that by considering three dimensions of the phonotext — 1) the textual manifestation of the poem, 2) the audio of the poet performing it, and 3) a visualization of that audio — the reader–listener can empirically confirm the ear’s impressions and expose new facets of the sonic materiality of the performed poem. In support of this methodology, I will demonstrate a new digital tool for aligning these three facets of the phonotext. ",

Since technologies have illocutionary force, we should ask of any representation of history, In what ways are the associated technologies conveying meaning?

The goal is to better understand how textual technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow capture or obscure the material history of their texts. The article proceeds in two main parts. First, two kinds of technologies commonly used are examined and compared: the non-digital book and its familiar digital counterparts. Second, we will consider ways in which augmented reality and virtual reality have been used and might be used to represent texts. It will be suggested that these new technologies may overcome some of the limitation of previous book technologies in capturing a text’s history. In conclusion, practical suggestions will be made for those who read, study, or produce digital textual objects.  ",

        "abstract": " This paper presents findings from a set of contextual inquiry sessions completed in 2016 as part of the four year Digital Scholarly Workflow project (2012-2016) conducted at the Pennsylvania State University and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Studying humanists’ workflows through contextual inquiry enabled us to gain valuable empirical insights into digital scholarship from the perspective of individual scholars. This small-scale observational study (N=8) supplemented findings from our larger scale (N=196) and medium scale (N=23) studies previously completed in the project, allowing us to develop deeper qualitative understanding of how humanists’ research practices change in the encounter with digital technologies. Through close contextual analysis of information-based research activities we illustrate how humanists build rich personal collections of digital sources, which become important information resources in their work. We also examine how adoption of digital tools transforms the established methods of managing primary and secondary sources, bringing hastier digital workflows to traditionally more methodical work. Finally, we show that efficiency cannot be qualified as a neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools, independent of scholars’ practices, since scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts determines what constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar’s workflow. We conclude that in humanists’ workflows digital and analog tools and resources do not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant position. They rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid workflow that comes to our respondents as an organic manifestation of their work, and as an illustration of the bricolage character of humanists’ digital workflows.

        "abstract": " The proliferation of tools that enable anyone to create visualizations of their data, even with limited experience or skills, has made data visualization more accessible than ever before. This is true in its use in both teaching and learning, as data visualization has increasingly taken on an important pedagogical role in the classroom and in scholarly research. However, with this proliferation of tools there has been a concomitant awareness that visualization needs to be employed through a critical lens that acknowledges its constructedness as explanatory medium and as a product of situated knowledges. Here, I describe one approach to teaching this notion of constructedness via a framework oriented around information literacy, which encourages critical engagement with data, the tools we use to interrogate them, and the visualizations we design to represent them. I describe this approach through a collection of critical dichotomies used to evaluate the authority and value of visualizations, which are mapped to a subset of the core information literacy competencies defined in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education. To put these dichotomies into practice, I further describe an interactive activity called Choose Your Own Adventure, with Data Visualization, in which participants are given paper and markers to create booklets in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure books and asked to consider the relationship between active choices in the design process of a visualization and how a given visualization is interpreted. In the process, I explore how this framework can encourage us all, as critical practitioners of visualization, to think about the practical relationship between data visualization and information literacy more generally.

        "abstract": " Data visualization has rapidly become a standard approach to interrogating and understanding the world around us in domains that extend beyond the technical and scientific to arts, communications and services. In business settings the Data Scientist has become a recognized and valued role . Journalism has re-oriented itself around data-driven storytelling as a potential saviour for an industry in peril . Governments are moving to more data-driven decision making, publishing open data portals and pondering visualization as an opportunity for citizen participation . This journal itself has numerous examples that use visualization tools and techniques within the digital humanities as a tool for exploration  . This boom in attention has led large new populations of learners into the field. Formal educational settings have rushed to create new approaches and introductions to this content, but often they fall back on traditional approaches to things such as scientific charting and graphing  . Many view data visualization as a new technology, which runs the risks of replicating old approaches without acknowledging the unique affordances and domains that data visualization relies upon. Data visualization is not simply another technology to integrate into education. It is visual argument and persuasion, far more closely associated with rhetoric and writing than spreadsheets . In this paper we present novel approaches to learning technologies and activities, focused on novice learners entering the field of data driven storytelling. We begin with a deeper dive into the problems we see with introducing new learners into a field characterized by inequality, continue with a discussion of approaches for introducing technologies to education, and summarize the inspirational pedagogies we build on. We then offer some design principles and three activities as examples of the concept of creative data literacy. We assert that creative approaches grounded in constructionist educational theories are necessary to empower non-technical learners to be able to tell stories and argue for change with data. ",

        "abstract": " For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liu’s call for critical digital humanities. Projects such as #TornApart/Seperados and #PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities? , All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave , and Beyond the Margins: Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities have paved the way for socially conscious developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from administrators, institutions, and funding agencies often discourage critical engagement in favor of tool development and/or high tech projects . As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together. So, how should teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities framework in the classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I assert that one effective strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate topics such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status through the careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches students to think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them to participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of harmful narratives and power structures. While this approach differs from the tool-based pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis on knowledge production, critical thinking, digital literacy, and social justice gives students proficiency in socially conscious methodologies that can be applied to any project. Linking curation to making and breaking, two digital humanities approaches to meaning-making, provides a method for interrogating archives of humanity and developing a pedagogy grounded in cultural critique and social justice .

This paper focuses on visualization aesthetics and perception by making the case for using graphic design techniques and design languages to understand and create more aesthetically pleasant and functionally effective information design and visualization. It uses cross-disciplinary reviews of background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design principles and methods in the realm of visualization education. A user-centered design framework and student projects are discussed by adapting graphic design elements into the visualization process. It shows that the practice of developing a visualization should be executed with an understanding of graphic design basics in mind, and with a balanced consideration of tangible and conditional design elements, as well as how these design elements fulfill the purpose of the objective, context, content, audience, and the knowledge of the design outcomes.

        "abstract": " The use of new technologies, media and computational methods in Humanities may evolve and indeed it is already changing the contents and forms of contemporary education, opening new scenarios previously unimaginable. Nowadays Visual Mobile Devices, smartphones, tablets, etc, contribute to a range of computer-mediated activities, which are related to specific locations and times. But for such critical reflection, we need a closer look to deeper layers of our culture to unveil the characteristics of new technologies and devices. This paper describes some emerging aspects of the teaching use of visual communication techniques in primary and secondary schooling. In particular it reviews the evidence of the efficiency of visual communication for learning both in varied curriculum disciplines and of transversal socio-ethical affective skills necessary for the promotion of health and the construction of a planetary citizenship. The paper illuminates the didactic applicability and unique potential of images for the epistemological peculiarities of different disciplines, highlighting how educational use of images in creative pedagogy can be more focused given the function they perform in the more general cognitive process of individuals. The theoretical analysis of the teaching validity of the use of visual communication, as reported in the international literature, seems to receive confirmation from a case study, which provides detailed analyses of how this technique can enhance specific projects and demonstrates its significance for wider practitioners.

Of the projects inherited by the lab, about half are either of exceptionally high quality or seminal in other ways but almost all of them struggled with funding and technical issues that threatened their survival. By taking a holistic approach to infrastructure, and software engineering and maintenance, the lab has resolved the majority of the issues and secured the short to medium term future of the projects in its care. This article details the conceptual, procedural, and technical approaches used to achieve that, and offers policy recommendations to prevent repetition of the situation in the future. ",

        "abstract": " Over the past few decades, the ever-expanding media of the digital world, including digital humanities endeavors, have become more reliant on the results of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Yet, unfortunately, medievalists have not had as much success with using OCR software on handwritten manuscripts as scholars using printed books as their sources. While some projects to ameliorate this situation have emerged in recent years, using software to create machine-readable results from medieval manuscripts is still in its infancy. This article presents the results of a series of successful experiments with open-source neural network OCR software on medieval manuscripts. Results over the course of these experiments yielded character and word accuracy rates over 90%, reaching 94% and 97% accuracy in some instances. Such results are not only viable for creating machine-readable texts but also pose new avenues for bringing together manuscript studies and digital humanities in ways previously unrealized. A closer examination of the experiments indicates regular patterns among the OCR results that could potentially allow for use cases beyond pure text recognition, such as for paleographic classifications of script types.

        "abstract": " We present findings from interdisciplinary research at the intersection between literary studies, information visualization, and interface design. Despite a growing interest in text visualization among literary scholars, so far, narrative visualizations are not designed to support the particular tasks involved in narratological analysis and often fail to reveal nuanced narratological features. One major outcome of our iterative research and design process is Narrelations, a novel visualization technique specifically suited for analyzing and interpreting narrative levels of a story and temporal aspects of its narrative representation. The visualization provides an overview of the nesting and distribution of narrative levels, integrates the representation of temporal phenomena, and facilitates the examination of correlations between these aspects. With this research we explore how collaboratively designed visual encodings and interaction techniques may allow for an insightful analysis at a high level coupled with a close inspection of text passages. We discuss prior work relevant to our research objectives and explain the specific characteristics of narrative levels and temporal aspects of narrative representation. After describing the research process and design principles, we apply the visualization on a test corpus of eight annotated German short stories and demonstrate its heuristic value for literary analyses and interpretations. In particular, we explore the intricate connections between the literary content of the novellas and their narrative form. ",

This research utilises as a case study the Battle of Mount Street Bridge of the Irish Easter 1916 Rising, in which the number of British casualties has been fiercely debated. The research is framed within the theory and practice of digital scholarly editions, which provides a new paradigm for approaching virtual worlds in a contextualized and annotated environment. This paper also discusses the challenges of creating virtual worlds for online environments in which there is rapid obsolescence of software and platforms and an absence of standards. ",

        "abstract": " This short essay describes the difficulties and impromptu workarounds that emerged when using the video game Minecraft as the central teaching tool in several professional writing seminars. More specifically, the author discusses a key moment in the semester where students needed to move between university and non-university technology infrastructures in order to create multiplayer gamespaces that were accessible to their peers. In narrating this experience, the author will demonstrate how a discourse of access can be used to examine the oft-invisible policies, procedures, and restrictions that shape the way we compose, circulate and make visible digitally-native work. Furthermore, the author will discuss how a critical emphasis on access can help teachers and students better mediate the relationship between internal or university-supplied technological infrastructures and external platforms when creating interactive digital projects. The underlying motivation of this essay is not to lambaste universities for lack of institutional support nor is it to champion commercial organizations as saviors for helping teachers successfully use digital platforms in the classroom. Instead, the goal of this brief essay is to spur discussions surrounding the following questions: how might we use issues regarding access to better examine and navigate the hard-to-define boundaries that separate university-sanction technology use from non-university sanctioned technology use? How might calling students' attention to access refine the larger learning objectives for Digital Humanities or DH-related courses? ",

        "abstract": " This essay responds to two questions at the heart of the Invisible Labor in the Digital Humanities 2016 symposium at Florida State University: (1) what is at stake in making unseen work visible, and (2) how can DH projects equally distribute and value the labor involved in their construction? For us, the answer to these questions lies in privileging the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this collaborative labor. By drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories, we highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as a tool for teaching undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible. We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the traditional About page to make visible all participants in the project. Third, we turn to an open discussion of the challenges faced in the politics of attribution when working with university, governmental and private historical organizations, including domain names and the use of organizational logos.

        "abstract": " Academic libraries have an important role to play in supporting digital humanities projects in their communities. Librarians at Stony Brook University Libraries host Open Mic events for digital humanities researchers, teachers, and students on campus.  Inspired by a desire to better serve digital humanists with existing projects, this event was initially organized to increase the visibility of scholars and students with nascent projects and connect these digital humanists to library supported resources and to one another. For the Libraries, the Open Mic was an opportunity to understand the scope and practices of the digital humanities community at Stony Brook, and to identify ways to make meaningful interventions.   An open mic is a uniquely suitable event format in that it embodies a dynamic, permissive, multidisciplinary presentation space that is as much for exercising new and ongoing research (and technologies) as it is for making discoveries and connections.  The success of these events can be measured in the establishment of the University Libraries as a nexus for digital humanities work, consultations, instruction, workshops, and community on a campus without a designated digital humanities center.   The digital humanities Open Mic event at Stony Brook University locates the digital humanities within the library’s repertoire, while signaling that the library is — in a number of essential ways — open.

        "abstract": " This article illuminates the ways that digital humanities labs might foster experiences for graduate students that fulfill what Alexander Reid (2002) postulates as the central task of the digital humanities graduate education. We argue that while the digital humanities lab as an institutional economic model does not necessarily promote a focus on graduate student professionalization, it uniquely has the capacity to push back against competing discourses of neoliberal vocationalism, funding and labor precarity on one hand, and technological utopianism and tool fetishization on the other, to train students agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to enter technologically-mediated workplaces and lives. To begin, we review the discussion of digital humanities labs in the literature: digital humanities institutional models, how these models are practiced, lab funding, and the resultant position of labs as sites of training for graduate students. From there, we offer a teaching case from the Lab’s fall 2015 “Stories from Data” workshop in order to render visible a set of principles to guide professionalization of graduate students in the digital humanities lab. We conclude with reflections on how these principles might alter current discussions of the success or failure of the Mellon Foundation and NEH ODH digital humanities funding initiatives in the United States.

The research reveals that the collective navigated institutional requirements and resources, the risks inherent in the tensions between the personal and the collective, and affective presence as part of the creation of the records that form the archive.

From this connection, we bring to light a hidden compositional structure, heretofore unidentified, in Cézanne’s Bathers as a series. Using computer-assisted systems such as DIAS and DENDRON allowed us to detect relatedness in these paintings not necessarily visible to the human eye. With DIAS and DENDRON, we generated dendrograms that clustered paintings related in brightness, saturation, complexity, and color. After studying color, we applied DIAS to the study of Cézanne’s composition. Because Cézanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding paintings in his conversations and letters, we programmed DIAS to compute axial lines and golden sections according to the dimensions of the square or rectangular painting under scrutiny. Using DIAS we identified the golden rectangle for Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana, Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux and Ingres’ La Source (another likely model for Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux). From the similarities and differences between the three paintings we identified, regarding their use of axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated a new approach to seeing Cézanne’s composition in his Bather series.   Cézanne’s noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as awkward and composed with baffling imbalance, we can now see as golden.

Thousands of volunteers are using LibriVox to collaboratively produce free audiobook versions of texts in the US public domain. The work of finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be digitized and published in audio form is complex and slow, and not all of this labor is ultimately visible, valued, or rewarded. Drawing on an ethnographic study of 12 years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of Anne of Green Gables have come into being, watching for ways in which policies and infrastructure have been influenced by variously visible and invisible forms of work. Making visible the intricate, unique, archived experiences of the crowdsourcing community of LibriVox volunteers and their tools adds to still-emerging discussions about how to value extra-institutional, public, distributed digital humanities work.

The author examines how we define digital humanities activism and how we frame its histories. Relying primarily on examples from Caribbean-oriented digital work, the author argues for a broad definition of DH activism that allows for a variety of projects and intended audiences. In particular, the essay responds to the tendency to focus on DH in the moment (projects that can be done quickly and yield a high social impact) as the primary form of activism, arguing that alongside such projects we include as activist projects that have a more cumulative and less immediate effect. Recently, we have begun to ask not just what the digital humanities does, but what the digital humanities does for others. This essay considers why it is that this has become a key question in this DH moment. ",

        "abstract": " This article articulates a digital adaptation of enumerative bibliography and argues for its recuperative potential in feminist literary history. Digital enumerative bibliography uses bibliographical structures within a relational database that allows researchers to track more relevant metadata such as geographical location of subject matter, language, and time period. Whereas traditional enumerative bibliographies use a hierarchy of textual data, a relational database creates a nexus that facilitates new kinds of research queries. As an example, we offer our digital project the Women in Book History Bibliography and use its 1,550 citations as a dataset to trace what is women’s book history. We then advocate for digital enumerative bibliography as a form of feminist recovery efforts that recovers not only primary texts but scholarship about them.  ",

        "abstract": " Our libraries are full of manuscripts, many of them modern. However, the digitisation of these unique documents is currently very expensive. How can we reduce the cost of encoding them in a way that will facilitate their study, annotation, searching, sharing, editing, comparison and reading over the Web? Unlike new documents prepared for the Web, historical manuscripts frequently contain internal variation in the form of erasures, insertions, substitutions and transpositions. Variation is also often expressed externally between copies of one work: in successive print editions, in manuscript copies or successive drafts. Current practice is to prepare separate transcriptions of each physical document and to embed internal variation directly into the transcribed text using complex markup codes. This makes the transcriptions expensive to produce and hard to edit, limits text reuse and requires that transcriptions be first disentangled via customised software for reading, searching, or comparison. An alternative approach, described here, is to separate out the internal variation of each document into notional layers. This is done primarily in order to facilitate the recording of revisions at any one point. The move is, of course, counter-intuitive since these document-wide layers were not intended by the author as texts to be read. But it proves itself in practice by radically simplifying the tasks of editing, searching and comparison. Versions, on the other hand, are higher-level constructs that do represent the state of a text as it was left at some point in time by an author or scribe. By employing layers to record complex revisions, the task of computing differences among intra-document layers and against versions of the same work in multiple documents may be delegated to the machine rather than having to be recorded laboriously by hand. The ensuing simplification of markup reduces transcription and editing costs, boosts text reuse and searching, and, by removing the need for customised software, increases the longevity of digital transcriptions.

        "abstract": " This article offers a methodological contribution to manually-assisted topic modeling. With the availability of vast amounts of (online) texts, performing full scale literary analysis using a close reading approach is not practically feasible. The set of alternatives proposed by Franco Moretti (2000) under the umbrella term of distant reading aims to show broad patterns that can be found throughout the entire text collection. After a survey of literary-critical practices that combine close and distant reading methods, we use manual annotations of a thread on Reddit, both to evaluate an LDA model, and to provide information that topic modeling lacks. We also make a case for applying these reading techniques that originate in literary reading more broadly to online, non-literary contexts. Given a large collection of posts from a Reddit thread, we compare a manual, close reading analysis against an automatic, computational distant reading approach based on topic modeling using LDA. For each text in the collection, we label the contents, effectively clustering related texts. Next, we evaluate the similarity of the respective outcomes of the two approaches. Our results show that the computational content/topic-based labeling partially overlaps with the manual annotation. However, the close reading approach not only identifies texts with similar content, but also those with similar function. The differences in annotation approaches require rethinking the purpose of computational techniques in reading analysis. Thus, we present a model that could be valuable for scholars who have a small amount of manual annotation that could be used to tune an unsupervised model of a larger dataset. ",

The sheer quantity of Tang poetry preserved in the Quan Tang shi (over 50,000 poems and poem fragments) exceeds the human-scale perspectives of close reading. To make sense of the corpus as a whole, we will show how two related forms of distant reading — topic modeling and divergence measures — allow us to reframe and rethink these literary historical questions and provide a new perspective on what it means to read Tang poetry.

In this paper we reflect on the difficulties posed by this work, and we argue that it is a serious challenge which ought to be taken up within the digital humanities and related efforts to computationally support scholarly practice. Network analysis, bibliometrics, and stylometrics, essentially leave out the fundamental humanistic skill of charitable argument interpretation because they touch very little on the meanings embedded in texts. We present a problematisation of the design space for potential tool development, as a result of insights about the nature and form of arguments in historical texts gained from our attempt to locate and map the arguments in one corner of the Hathi Trust digital library.

        "abstract": " With The Library of Digital Latin Texts (LDLT), the Digital Latin Library (DLL) is set to publish critical editions as sets of data independent of a presentational format. These datasets are meant to be reused for a variety of purposes and in a variety of presentational formats, including the DLL’s own user edition viewer and data visualization applications. It is thus vital to have a way of certifying the data as published in accordance with the DLL’s policies and procedures, central to which are its provisions for peer review. Accordingly, to facilitate the use of an edition’s data in different settings, and to promote a high degree of confidence in the quality of the data, we have introduced the DLL Review Registry Service. The DLL Review Registry Service offers a way of associating peer reviewed status with the text data rather than within any particularly visualization of that data. Any visualization of text data can consult this service and discover whether or not this data has been reviewed. In this way, we free the imprimatur from its association with any particular presentation and allow the indicators of quality to travel with the data and be communicated to end users in a plurality of visualizations.

I have found the number of songs that reached the Hot 100 per year more than halved between 1966 and 2002, which indicates a loss in diversity. I have also found that the variation of valence (or level of pleasantness) in the songs’ lyrics and the variation of a sampled Type Token ratio (an indicator for lexical complexity) decreases over time. This indicates that lyrics of popular songs become more similar and again signify a loss of diversity. ",

While other scholarly literature has considered collaborations between these groups via surveys or interviews with small project teams, the present study will provide a large-scale analysis of collaborations using survey responses from more than 500 scholars, librarians, and archivists. Questions sought to determine the extent to which these groups collaborate with one another on project teams; how these collaborations unfold and who initiates them; whether IPs have begun to adjust and adapt their work to support specific DH projects, or to make their content more appealing and easy for potential future DH projects; and what administrative hurdles are faced during the collaboration. The survey also address how information professionals and DH scholars view the success of the collaboration after completing their work, and whether they intend to collaborate in future. To conclude, the article will consider what these responses tell us about how best to support all members of these collaborations. ",

A new multi-dimensional ontology-based approach was applied to explore the geographic, temporal, actor- and subject-based distribution of censorship events. We adopted an ontology-based approach to apply statistical analysis on the metadata of censored Hebrew manuscripts for estimating the scope and quantifying the extent of the known facts on the censorship activity and its various characteristics over the years. In addition, we revealed some previously unknown phenomena and trends. Particularly, we analysed the relationship of censorship on other types of events in manuscripts’ lifecycle and compared the distribution of censored vs. non-censored manuscripts in different dimensions. We also devised a set of rules to complete the missing locations of over 50% of censorship events, which has substantially changed the big picture of spatial distribution of censorship activity. From the temporal perspective our findings demonstrate that censorship was conducted in waves and there was a decrease in the creation of new manuscripts in periods of high censorship activity. Certain subjects, such as Kabbalah and Philosophy were censored significantly more than others, and the locations and script types’ distribution in censored manuscripts differs from the non-censored manuscripts.

        "abstract": " This article describes a collaboration between two tenured faculty members (one in the library and one in a department of modern languages) at a large, land-grant institution who sought to introduce a mixed undergraduate and graduate seminar in French literature to DH methods in the second-language classroom culminating in a digital mapping project. Lacking explicit previous training in DH, faculty drew on second language (L2) pedagogy, new literacies, and DH pedagogy to develop an inclusive approach to course design and implementation. The approach focused on students’ development of agency and authority as rising scholars while underscoring conceptions of labor and professional development in the humanities. There is limited scholarship addressing implementing DH in a L2 classroom. However, implementing a combined approach where one pedagogy influenced the other afforded the opportunity to critically consider the role of multilingualism and multiculturalism in a global, open DH context. We adopted this approach in concert with lessons drawn from theories of information literacy and new literacies. This transdisciplinary method encouraged careful consideration of design and implementation given that how information is processed, acquired, and communicated are key concerns in both L2 classrooms and new literacies.

        "abstract": " This essay discusses the process of editing a rather simple playtext, the English traveling players' Fortunatus, with a quite complex history of circulation and performance and a vast network of sources and influences. Since the traveling theater was contingent (context-based) and extemporaneous, the associated playtexts, collaborative adaptations and translations of English works, present unique challenges for editors and scholars. In fact, their printed form often misrepresents the kind of theater practiced. I raise the question of how the textual remnants of this theater shaped critical attitudes regarding the travelers, and I suggest that capabilities of digital publication can illuminate the episodic and modular characteristics of early modern performance.

        "abstract": " Historians have regularly debated whether advertisements can be used as a viable source to study the past. One of their main concerns centered on the question of agency. Were advertisements a reflection of historical events and societal debates, or were ad makers instrumental in shaping society and the ways people interacted with consumer goods? Using techniques from econometrics (Granger causality test) and complexity science (Adaptive Fractal Analysis), this paper analyzes to what extent advertisements shaped or reflected society. We found evidence that indicates a fundamental difference between the dynamic behavior of word use in articles and advertisements published in a century of Dutch newspapers. Articles exhibit persistent trends. Contrary to this, advertisements have a more irregular behavior characterized by short bursts and fast decay, which, in part, mirrors the dynamic through which advertisers introduced terms into public discourse. On the issue of whether advertisements shaped or reflected society, we found particular product types that seemed to be collectively driven by a Granger causality going from advertisements to articles. Generally, we found support for a complex interaction pattern, analogous to Cowan’s concept of the consumption junction. Finally, we discovered noteworthy patterns in terms of Granger causality and long-range dependencies for specific product groups. All in, this study shows how methods from econometrics and complexity science can be applied to humanities data to improve our understanding of complex cultural-historical phenomena such as the role of advertising in society.

        "abstract": " The Palatine Anthology (PA) Project, coordinated by the Canada Research Chair on digital textualities directed by Marcello Vitali-Rosati, collaborates with several international partners, including Italian and French schools, in order to establish a collaborative critical digital edition and a multilingual translation of all the PA's epigrams. In particular, our project aims to further develop this edition of the PA, thereby demonstrating the philological, editorial and pedagogic challenges involved in compiling the diverse fragments of this collection of Greek epigrams. Since its discovery in 1606 by Claude Saumaise in the Palatina Library of Heidelberg in Germany , the PA manuscript (Codex Palatinus 23) has considerably influenced literature and art. As we know it today, the Anthology is the result of successive compilations, modifications, additions, and rearrangements by the compilers. Meleager's collection is a collection of epigrams compiled in the first century B.C., which represents the original source of what is known today as the Greek Anthology . This collection, called The Garland, was not randomly arranged, but according to a series of particular organizational principles .  The PA challenges the concept of an oeuvre – as a unified and cohesive body of work –, insofar as it brings together 4 000 epigrams written by more than one hundred different authors from over sixteen centuries of literary production (from the Byzantine empire to the 10th century AD). If we cannot consider the Anthology as a unified and cohesive work, how do we account for it in an edition? To these questions, the digital environment presents tools and possibilities allowing us to organize our research, and ultimately work towards finding some answers. In an attempt to provide tangible solutions to the difficulty of assembling such a fragmented body of work the PA Project harnesses digital tools. We have created an open database searchable via an API that allows one to transcribe the manuscript, propose translations, align translations, transcribe scholia, and link epigrams both to each other and to external literary and artistic references. We aim to demonstrate the importance of philological approaches to texts; redefine the boundaries between scholarly and amateur practices; connect contemporary readers and scholars with Classical texts; supplement the Perseus project; and harness the potential of semantic web technologies. We aim to shed light on the many ways to engage with textual objects, to conceive of a multiple reception of the anthological imaginary . The interface of our digital platform does intend for users to propose such reading pathways and weak ties , because it enables them to associate an epigram with a reference (textual, iconographic, musical, cinematographic, and others) and thereby demonstrate a collective engagement with the epigram . This demonstrates how collective imaginaries are able to enrich our understanding of the anthological material. By enabling the users to engage with this otherwise elusive literary object, the Greek epigrams, and with a cultural object, our project enables contemporary readers to engage with the digital possibilities in order to visualize a collective imaginary or topoï , and to contribute to philological research on the origins and influences of the PA .

Using insights developed by critical algorithm and critical archival studies, it analyzes how JSTOR’s topics repeatedly misrepresent and erase work in women’s, African diasporic/African American, and Native American and settler colonial histories. The article discusses concerns over the power of metadata, the need for transparent and domain-expert-involved indexing processes, and digital providers’ responsibilities to accurately categorize scholars’ work. It particularly focuses on the potentially disproportionate harm done to traditionally marginalized fields of study through seemingly racist or sexist topical labeling that impedes knowledge discovery.

        "abstract": " Semantic Web technologies provide the ability to more effectively connect and integrate structured data by disclosing their intended meaning and therefore making explicit their description, context and provenance. Thanks to their nature, Semantic Web technologies have produced insights into the challenges associated with standardizing metadata for manuscripts. Scholars depend on highly specific catalogue records in order to understand a manuscript and raise research questions which take into account either its physicality or its nature of evidence for all aspects of life in the medieval period. However, the heterogeneity of codicological-paleographical records in terms of metadata and terminology is weakening the integration and interoperability within the community. Ontologies in particular have been evaluated as a clever approach towards a better communication. The employment of knowledge representation in the field of medieval manuscript descriptions is still narrow, though. Against the state of the art, this paper attempts to add some evidence: it analyses the impact of a top-level ontology designed for modelling cultural objects, namely CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, on a set of fifteen Italian manuscript descriptions encoded in TEI standard using the online platform ManusOnLine. In this case study, the semantics underlying the selected TEI XML-encoded manuscript descriptions were visually explored according to a subset of CIDOC CRM’s classes and properties. In doing so, the process of the creation of a manuscript was split and analysed in its internal phases in accordance with the CIDOC CRM event-modelling principle. Within the dataset, tags as <date> and <name> are used sporadically to encode factual information; however, this case study shows that events and relations can be generally deduced from the XML structure of a manuscript description, although they are not expressively identified. Overall, the analysis demonstrates that CIDOC CRM can represent a valuable aid to overcome manuscripts-related issues — i.e. granularity, contradictory knowledge and terminology — and potentially create an interlinked data platform which could greatly enhance the study of human culture.

        "abstract": " Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on contemporary and historical data is still in the focus of many researchers. Especially historical prints require book specific trained OCR models to achieve applicable results  . To reduce the human effort for manually annotating ground truth (GT) various techniques such as voting and pretraining have shown to be very efficient  . Calamari is a new open source OCR line recognition software that both uses state-of-the art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented in Tensorflow and giving native support for techniques such as pretraining and voting. The customizable network architectures constructed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers are trained by the so-called Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm of Graves et al. (2006). Optional usage of a GPU drastically reduces the computation times for both training and prediction. We use two different datasets to compare the performance of Calamari to OCRopy, OCRopus3, and Tesseract 4. Calamari reaches a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.11% on the UW3 dataset written in modern English and 0.18% on the DTA19 dataset written in German Fraktur, which considerably outperforms the results of the existing softwares.

This contrasts with the wealth of potential opportunities that could arise from closer collaborations. We argue that more efforts are needed to make NLP tools work for DH datasets so that that NLP research applied to humanities data receives more attention, leading to the development of evaluation approaches tailored towards relevant research questions. This has the potential to bring methodological advances to NLP, while at the same time confronting DH datasets with powerful state-of-the-art techniques. ",

        "abstract": " Digital editions are easily modified after they are first published — a state of affairs that poses challenges both for long-term scholarly reference and for various forms of electronic distribution and analysis. This article argues that producers of digital editions should assign meaningful version numbers to their editions and update those version numbers with each change, allowing both humans and computers to know when resources have been modified and how significant the changes are. As an examination of versioning practices in the software industry reveals, version numbers are not neutral descriptors but social products intended for use in specific contexts, and the producers of digital editions must consider how version numbers will be used in developing numbering schemes. It may be beneficial to version different parts of an edition separately, and in particular to version the data objects or content of an edition independently from the environment in which it is displayed. The article concludes with a case study of the development of a versioning policy for the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and includes an appendix surveying how a selection of digital editions handle the problem of recording and communicating changes.

This paper focuses on the work of cultural heritage institutions, which are increasingly offering collections as data. This paper outlines the collections as data project and examines specific examples of cultural institutions active in this space. The paper then details the practices of data brokers, and explores how the data broker model can frame the use of data in cultural heritage institutions. In closing a number of experiments are described that might help mitigate the harm that data in cultural institutions might cause.

As a part of this work the materials that were produced by the project have been made available as Linked Open Data (LOD): translated into RDF, and served through an RDF Server. This article explains what it means to present the material as Linked Open Data by means of working, interactive examples. DPRR didn't do some of the work which has been conventionally associated with Linked Open Data. However, by considering the two conceptions of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data as proposed by Tim Berners-Lee one can see how DPRR's RDF Server fits best into the LOD picture, including how it might serve to facilitate new ways to explore its material. The article gives several examples of ways of exploiting DPRR's RDF dataset, and other similarly structured materials, to enable new research approaches. ",
