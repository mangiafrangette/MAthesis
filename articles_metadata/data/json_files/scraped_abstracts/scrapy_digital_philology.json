I use this controversy as a point of departure from which to re-examine the nineteenth-century myth of nationalism that casts the Armagnacs, supporters of Charles VII, as protonationalists. If the type of nationalism that the Armagnacs represented possesses any didactic force today, it is as a negative exemplum. Based on contemporary chronicle representations of the faction revealing how it understood itself and how it was viewed by its enemies, I argue that the Armagnacs are better seen as members of a feuding faction than as early nationalists to conclude that recent debate over national identity would be well served by acknowledging from the outset the fictive nature of what the History of France relates about the trajectory towards national unity and the perennial disagreement over who is French and who is not.\n    </p>"]},

At the same time, it will be stressed that stylometry’s application to medieval texts is currently not without problems: many attribution techniques are still controversial and do not account for the specific nature of medieval text production. Throughout this paper, I will tentatively apply two well-established attribution techniques (principal components analysis and Burrows’s Delta) to a number of case studies in Middle Dutch studies.

Increasingly diverse ethnicity in nation states alters the status of once dominant vernaculars—what Dante called the <i>parlar materno</i>—as factors of cultural and social cohesion. Language and religion, rather than nation, now serve as elective markers of identity. Inevitably, however, to assert global status for a language conveys overtones of linguistic, and thus cultural, hegemony.\n    </p>", "<p>\n      From this perspective, Carl Schmitt’s dictum that “all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts,” resonates in the sphere of language. For when Schmitt refers to modern concepts of state as theological in origin, his thought speaks directly to the concept of global language. For “global” is only a slightly attenuated variant of “universal,” whose totalizing connotation we find somewhat embarrassing today. And yet, historically, the myth of a lost universal language has played an important role in traditional cultures that value creation accounts. The latter evoke a mythic moment, <i>in illo tempore</i>, when all humans spoke a common language for the simple reason that the origin of the one implicated the emergence of the other.\n    </p>", "<p>\n      Perhaps no one thought so profoundly about the question of global or universal language in this sense as Dante Alighieri in his philosophical treatise on the illustrious vernacular, the <i>De vulgari eloquentia</i> (c. 1304 CE, <i>DVE</i>). Unlike proponents of global language today who seek to extrapolate a (pre)dominant language from among hundreds of dialects, Dante recognized multilingualism as an historical contingency, a product of the linguistic fall at Babel. At that point, universal language—the speech co-created by God and the first man in Genesis—disappeared, fractured into linguistic shards representing the diversity of human culture.\n    </p>", "<p>\n      Dante’s anthropology of language thus imitates the division of the first human into an infinite series, each unit different from others, but all containing an originary “DNA,” identified in Genesis 1:26–27 as divine similitude. Likewise, Dante proposes that all human language possess a common “deep structure,” a set of principles for a universal grammar that act as the formal cause of language. Dante calls this capacity for language the <i>forma locutionis</i>, the innate capacity for speech, which defines humans. For Dante, only the vernacular or mother tongue can embody this essence. Jointly created by God and the first man, it has the potential to incarnate the highest aspiration of human speech, the <i>volgare illustre</i> or illustrious vernacular.\n    </p>", "<p>\n      Although Dante lays out his anthropology of the vernacular in <i>De vulgare eloquentia</i>—arguing that one must look to the most refined vernacular poetry for examples—he defers demonstrating the concept fully until <i>Purgatorio</i> and <i>Paradiso</i>. There he deploys text networks invoking Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and diverse vernacular poets and philosophers to showcase the <i>volgare illustre</i> as a universal vernacular—a <i>forma locutionis</i> in which the meaning, aura, and affect of speaking take precedence over language of origin.\n    </p>"]},

Common practice dictates that behind every text, a patron-figure looms, typically identified as a member of nobility for whom the text was composed. Many medieval texts promote this view by spotlighting extratextual relations in dedication materials or by folding into the narrative itself the story of its inception. Regardless of the source of these narratives, scholarship places under the patronage umbrella a large spectrum of exchanges said to have fostered the literary enterprise while excluding other partnerships that are seen to destabilize the system. Thus, transactions as distinctive as Guillaume de Machaut’s <i>Confort d’amy</i>, presented as an unsolicited text intended to comfort the imprisoned Charles of Navarre; Jean Froissart’s fictive account of literary collaboration with a prince in the <i>Prison amoureuse</i>; Christine de Pizan’s biography of Charles V, identified in the prologue as a commission ordered by the duke of Burgundy; and Geoffrey Chaucer’s dedication of <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> to fellow poet John Gower and the lawyer Ralph Strode are presented as forms of patronage with little thought to the implications of the relational variations. At the same time, a number of transactions are sidelined in patronage studies because they seem to transgress the boundaries of expected exchange, even though they reproduce many of the same dynamics; hence, regifting, seizure of books, multi-copy dissemination of a single work, and purchase of a book from a third party regularly fail to figure into analysis. To date, scholars have avoided interrogating these arbitrary boundaries that define patronage studies. Critical avoidance of the heterogeneity of literary support networks is further exacerbated by a generalized failure to interrogate the impact of time, place, or cultural practices on sponsorship, not to mention possible manipulations of this exchange based on political, economic or personal concerns.</p>"]},

Editions, transformed from single textual occurrences into fluid, communal, and unfolding processes, can uncover a complex notion of medieval hypertextuality by linking texts, images, and tunes. They can then even trace the reception of a given text.

This paper analyzes the influence of Hegel’s philosophy of history on Auerbach’s conceptions of literary history, reality, and truth, as evidenced in <i>Mimesis</i>’s famous first chapter, “Odysseus’ Scar.” Auerbach chose the Hegelian concept of reality (<i>Wirklichkeit</i>) as the subtitle of his book to advance its main thesis, opposing realism to myths and legends, rationality to the flight from reason. He refutes the claim that classical Greek myths, legends, and heroes inaugurated Western culture’s representation of reality and, hence, conception of history. Instead, he finds their origins in the Old Testament, with its formulation of world, universal history, and “concept of the historically becoming,” an important Hegelian concept according to which the temporal becoming and unfolding of the life of human beings is meaningful, intelligible, and should be thought of as evolutionary progress toward a certain goal or end.\n\t</p>"]},

I use Deleuze's and DeLanda's discussions of assemblage theory to consider how Arabic versions of the tale link heterogeneous fields and genres of knowledge into a fantasy of feminine, enslaved omnicompetence, and also how the tales' global transmigrations create a network of multifaceted and larger-than-Eurocentric research, informed but not deliminated by colonialism and decolonization.</p>"]},

How might the royal photograph be both sacred and secular? How are premodern understandings of kingship, including the taboo on the monarchy's public representation, reconciled with the contemporary hypervisibility of the monarchy?

Our light notation moves the bulk of markup into a separate &lt;standoff&gt; element, grouping layers of related textual features encoded via existing TEI elements (e.g., &lt;name&gt; or &lt;corr&gt;) into individual &lt;stf&gt; elements; furthermore, our proposed notation provides a schema for referencing the transcription using the xml:id attribute. This approach is illustrated through a variety of examples. Our proof-of-concept transformation package works directly on the stand-off markup without the necessity of reducing it back to inline TEI for parsing, querying, and visualizing.</p>"]},

This essay argues that Magriço (Álvaro Gonçalves Coutinho), the protagonist of \"The Twelve of England,\" embodies a larger theme in the epic of national belatedness that is integral to the poem's engagement with the temporalities of empire and cultural inheritance. But the <em>Lusiads</em>'s utility as a cultural artifact celebrating the rise of new forms of knowledge and power also provides the conceptual basis for its symbolic appropriation by Portugal's imperial rivals, Spain and England. The essay concludes by examining representations of Camões in twentieth-century Brazilian <em>folhetos</em> (\"leaflets\"), or <em>literatura de cordel</em>, to show how the <em>Lusiads</em>'s anxieties about textual survival and generativeness provide a discursive frame for Camões's later textual incarnations.</p>"]},

Part of this trend is looking beyond circulation in Europe to circulation across south-south boundaries, or even from south to north, the latter of which I have done much to try to forward. In this essay, however, I consider an instance of ostensible Europe-to-Africa textual transfer: the body of folktales that circulated around the medieval world about miracles performed by Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus. The Ethiopian Marian tales, which appear in a compilation text titled <em>Täˀammərä Maryam</em> (Miracles of Mary), are sometimes mistakenly said to have arisen solely in Europe. To explore the issue of influence, I examine a Marian tale innovated in Ethiopia titled \"The Cannibal of Qəmər\" (or \"The Miracle of the Man-Eater\" or \"The Story of Belai\"). Reading the cannibal tale diachronically, relationally, allegorically, and intertextually reveals much. The Marian tale template first devised in the Levant persists across multiple boundaries yet was radically adapted in Ethiopia, underscoring why care is required when discussing African narrative adaptation of outside texts.</p>"]},

This paper explores the notion of vulnerability through the lens of leprosy. Medieval society regarded the leper as being touched by God, a physical manifestation of an inward transgression. Ami, as a leper, incites both fear and longing: the disease excludes him from society due to its contagious and incurable nature. Concurrently, it provides the opportunity for charity by tending to the sick and lowly. In this case, it allows Amile and his children to perform charitable Christian sacrifices to save Ami: Amile murders his own children for the blood cure, while the children die for the benefit of another. Their sacrifices are rewarded as the children are restored to life and Amile is forgiven the infanticide, revealing a logic of vulnerability that applies to the characters as well as the political and social institutions in place. In the end, it is vulnerability that permits ultimate redemption and allows secular personages to achieve spiritual elevation.</p>"]},
