The present study addresses the influences of wind flow structure, as an important denudation factor, on the site and its famous monuments: the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx. Three-dimensional CFD simulations have been performed based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for the cases of the northwest wind, at the average wind speed over the year, and the southwest windstorms. In addition, the wind-driven sand was considered for the same cases. Particular attention was paid to the Great Sphinx and the Pyramids to investigate their parts most vulnerable to the wind, which is contributing to the erosion of these monuments. The Great Sphinx was buried by sand and it was cleared several times throughout its history. In this study, we also address the less understood, yet important, burial mechanism of the Great Sphinx. The present work may give more insight to the effect of wind around the Giza Plateau when developing a global plan for conserving and protecting the site.</p></div></div>"

Interest in the semantic Web has revived the dream, but many are sceptical. This article offers a breakthrough to problems of semantic interoperability and defends the feasibility of a global knowledge network against traditional counterarguments. It offers a new approach based on (i) interdisciplinary research of scholarly and scientific discourse, (ii) a generic global ontological model based on relations and co-reference rather than objects, (iii) semi-automatic maintenance of co-reference links, and (iv) public engagement in the creation and development of the network.</p></div></div>"

Information is modeled here with an ontology based on the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model (ISO 21127). When instantiated with some realistic examples taken from the field of biodiversity (collecting, determination, type creation, expedition, and observation events), the formal specification of semantic concepts makes scientific activities commonly understandable. Ontologies not only allow one to describe the results of scientific activities, such as a description of a biological species, but they can help to clarify the path by which the goal was reached. In particular, they provide a high-level uniform representation of transdisciplinary research activities and results. Ontologies as knowledge representation tools will therefore have strong impact on methodological questions and research strategies for different domains such as biology, archaeology, art history, and socio-economy. They can be regarded as semantic glue between and within scientific and scholarly domains as demonstrated in a series of examples. Following this approach, some requirements for research and development of integrated IT environments between memory instutions are derived.</p></div></div>"

We describe IGP images using the discrete symmetry groups theory. Our model contains the three following steps. (1) By noting that these patterns fall into three major categories, we begin our indexation process by classifying every pattern into one of these categories. The first pattern category describes all the patterns generated by translation along one direction. Every pattern of this category can be classified into one of the seven Frieze groups. The second type of pattern contains translational symmetries in two independent directions. Patterns of this category can be classified into one of the seventeen Wallpaper groups. The last type, called rosettes, describes patterns which begin at a central point and grow radially outward. We use rosette symmetry groups to classify patterns of this latter category. (2) For every pattern, we extract the symmetry features, namely, the symmetry group and the fundamental region, which is a representative region in the image from which the whole image can be regenerated. But for rosette groups, we can also compute the number of folds. (3) Finally, we describe the fundamental region by a simple color histogram and build the feature vector which is a combination of the symmetry feature (defined in the second step) and histogram information. Experiments show promising results for either IGP images' classification or indexing. Efforts for the subsequent task of classifying Islamic geometrical patterns' images can be significantly reduced.</p></div></div>"

This article presents a unified approach to illustrating four-dimensional data concerning a cultural heritage site. The proposed framework provides a semi-automatic approach to both reconstructing the environment and bringing all the time-dependent models into an intuitive visualization package. For each time period considered for reconstruction, the system requires a set of building footprint maps depicting the layout of the environment plus a few statistics. The statistics govern the construction of three-dimensional building models, allowing each building's architectural style, typical building height, and roof style to be altered. This information is automatically processed and converted into a form that can be visualized. By integrating high quality landmark buildings from laser scanning or interactive modelling packages into the automatically generated scene, the cultural heritage site is realized both in a spatial and temporal context. The visualization is achieved via a 4D navigable movie which is presented using two concrete implementations written using Flash and OpenGL. The OpenGL-based implementation allows a collection of 3DS Max scenes to be automatically visualized requiring only a set of camera paths identified by the user.</p></div></div>"

Taking the cleaning of impressionist paintings as a case study, survival analysis is carried out on metadata from conservation records for the Tate, UK, the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, and the National Trust, UK. Currently the only guidance available is offered by the National Trust. Based on cost-benefit analysis, it suggests an interval of 25 years for light surface cleaning and 100 years for major treatment. The majority of paintings held by the National Trust are pre-20th century, with a varnish layer protecting the paint surface. Arguments are put forward that this guidance cannot be applied to unvarnished paintings with exposed ground and a fragile paint layer. The cleaning process for these types of paintings poses a greater risk as it inevitably causes some loss of paint. Any cleaning of paintings in this category is more akin to a major conservation treatment. The Kaplan Meier Product Limit estimator uses metadata collected from the conservation records to estimate an average inter-cleaning period for the Tate, UK, and National Gallery, Oslo. The result of the theoretical analysis, although highly dependent on the quality of conservation records available, is supplemented by evidence from practical experience. Current views on acceptable frequency of cleaning and the associated risks of treatment are sought using a survey of conservators with experience of treating impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. This is applied to a case study of the Munch paintings in the University Aula, Oslo, that are currently unacceptably dirty. In the past, these paintings have been cleaned on average once every 14 years, which is clearly too often. The results suggest that the intercleaning period should be increased by a factor of three. Criteria are discussed for improving the environment within the University Aula, Oslo, to achieve this goal.</p></div></div>"

Recent technologies have proven a powerful tool for a better understanding of our cultural heritage through which to attain a glimpse of the environments in which our ancestors lived.

This is particularly evident in extreme lighting conditions, such as bright light or dark environments. However, a major portion of the visible spectra captured by our visual system cannot be represented in most display devices. High dynamic range imagery is a field of research which is developing techniques to correct such inaccuracies. This new viewing paradigm is perfectly suited for archaeological interpretation, since its high contrast and chromaticity can present us with an enhanced viewing experience, closer to what an inhabitant of that era may have seen.</p><p>In this article we present a case study of the reconstruction of a Roman site. We generate high dynamic range images of mosaics and frescoes from one of the most impressive monuments in the ruins of Conimbriga, Portugal, an ancient city of the Roman Empire. To achieve the requisite level of precision, in addition to having a precise geometric 3D model, it is crucial to integrate in the virtual simulation authentic physical data of the light used in the period under consideration. Therefore, in order to create a realistic physical-based environment, we use in our lighting simulations real data obtained from simulated Roman luminaries of that time.</p></div></div>"

A set of assumptions concerning the actions the artists might have taken in order to create the spiral themes is stated and supported. These assumptions refer to the existence of a draft plan, the sequence of brush strokes, the placement of the brush on the wall, as well as the possible form of the apparatus. These conjectures are evaluated and tested by means of curve fitting and image analysis methods developed by the authors. The results indicate that all drawn contour parts optimally fit along a single prototype linear spiral with fitting error of less than 0.4mm, supporting existence of a very advanced culture for the era of geometric guide. It is statistically rejected that this guide could have the form of a stamp. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the painter might have used a draft plan of the spiral themes to prepare the final drawing and that the linear spiral guide has been used by alternating its placements in order to form the internal and external spiral contour.</p></div></div>"

Nevertheless, especially in low-end cameras integrated flash lights are considered as not reliable for high-quality images, due to known artifacts (sharp shadows, highlights, uneven lighting) generated in images. Moreover, a mathematical model of this kind of light is difficult to create. In this article we present a color correction space which, given some information about the geometry of the pictured scene, is able to provide a space-dependent color correction for each pixel of the image. The correction space can be calculated once in a lifetime using a quite fast acquisition procedure; after 3D spatial calibration, the obtained color correction function can be applied to every image where flash is the dominant light source. We developed this approach to produce better color samples in the application framework of color mapping on 3D scanned models. The correction space proposed presents several advantages: it is independent from the kind of light used (provided that it is bound to the camera), it gives the possibility to correct some artifacts (for example, color deviation) introduced by flash light, and it has a wide range of possible applications, from image enhancement to material color estimation. Moreover, once that the inverse photo-to-geometry transformation is known, it allows the easy estimation of the flash light position and permits to identify and remove other annoying artifacts, like highlights and shadows. The resulting approach allows to gather in an easy manner a better and more consistent color information and to produce higher-quality 3D models.</p></div></div>"

Current argumentation models are either not analytical enough or restricted to formal logic. For that purpose, we seek a model of human argumentation in which reasoning may not only consist of falsification or verification but more generally of strengthening or weakening hypotheses, and a way to connect this model to an ontology of the domain of discourse. We have studied examples of factual argumentation in empirical research in archaeology. Based on this and other empirical material, we propose an innovative integrated model of factual argumentation that includes evolution, composition, and revision of arguments. It makes explicit both the processes of argument-making and the states of belief at a particular point in time in a composite inference, and connects explicitly to a domain ontology, free of tacit background knowledge. We have implemented the model in a more restricted form and tested it with published archaeological examples. Future work may generalize the model to other kinds of argumentation.</p></div></div>"

Modern scanning devices enable very detailed geometry to be acquired, but it is usually quite hard to apply these technologies to large artifacts. In this article we present a project aimed at virtually reconstructing the impressive (7×11 m.) portal of the Ripoll Monastery, Spain. The monument was acquired using triangulation laser scanning technology, producing a dataset of 2212 range maps for a total of more than 1 billion triangles. All the steps of the entire project are described, from the acquisition planning to the final setup for dissemination to the public. We show how time-of-flight laser scanning data can be used to speed-up the alignment process. In addition we show how, after creating a model and repairing imperfections, an interactive and immersive setup enables the public to navigate and display a fully detailed representation of the portal. This article shows that, after careful planning and with the aid of state-of-the-art algorithms, it is now possible to preserve and visualize highly detailed information, even for very large surfaces.</p></div></div>"

The surveys were performed with a new photogrammetric technique, Spherical Photogrammetry, developed by Gabriele Fangi [2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]. The method is based on so-called spherical panoramas. These are obtained by stitching together several pictures taken from the same point and covering 360°, which are then mapped in a plane with an equi-rectangular projection. This technique is normally used to produce QuickTime movies which have already proven to be very useful for the documentation of cultural heritage. One panorama can replace many normal photographic images. Ease, rapidity, low cost, and completeness of the documentation are the main advantages of this technique.</p><p>The Abbey of San Galgano is an important example of Gothic architecture in Italy. The church is empty and without its roof, which fell towards the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The photogrammetric survey was done in November 2009. Thirty-four panoramas were taken outside, around the perimeter of the complex, and 22 were taken inside the church. The Roman theatre of Sabratha, built in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD, was rebuilt in the years between 1930-1940 at the command of the Italian governor of Libya, Italo Balbo, as a rememberance of the past Roman Empire. The project was handled by two Italian archaeologists Caputo [1953] and Guidi [1935]. The photogrammetric survey was done in August 2009 with 22 panoramas taken around and inside the monument. These two projects are limited in their scope, not covering the geometry of the entire monuments. The time and the available resources did not permit a complete survey. The purpose of the two projects was not to satisfy the needs of a client, but only to demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of the approach. In these two projects accuracy tests were not made, but in other projects accuracy was found to be on the order of 1/1000 the object distance, say one centimeter every ten meters of distance from the object [Fangi 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2009, 2010].</p></div></div>"

Previous computer methods for this task provided scoring functions based on a variety of properties of potential matches, including color and geometric compatibility across fracture surfaces. However, they usually consider only one or at most a few properties at once, and therefore provide match predictions with very low precision. In this article, we investigate a machine learning approach that computes the probability that a match is correct based on the combination of many features. We explore this machine learning approach for ranking matches in three different sets of fresco fragments, finding that classifiers based on many match properties can be significantly more effective at ranking proposed matches than scores based on any single property alone. Our results suggest that it is possible to train a classifier on match properties in one dataset and then use it to rank predicted matches in another dataset effectively. We believe that this approach could be helpful in a variety of cultural heritage reconstruction systems.</p></div></div>"

However, while the human eye and brain can perceive visual art and notice the differences, similarities, and influential links between painters, computers employing artificial intelligence find this task far more challenging. In this article we show that computers can automatically analyze paintings of different artists and different schools of art in an unsupervised fashion. Experimental results show that the automatic computer analysis can group artists by their artistic movements, and provide a map of similarities and influential links that is largely in agreement with the analysis of art historians. These results demonstrate that machine vision and pattern recognition algorithms are able to mimic the complex cognitive task of the human perception of visual art, and can be used to measure and quantify visual similarities between paintings, painters, and schools of art.</p></div></div>"

Musicians, and also choreographers, have long been able to express their creative choices using logical symbolic structures (music notation and dance notation), yet those working in the movie industry have to rely on cartoons and verbal description. Development of a successful notation becomes appropriate today because of its dependence upon the parallel development of effective notation-based software tools such as visualisation (automatic animated storyboard generation), production budget estimation, and automated rough editing of dailies. Directors maintain complete control of their creative decisions when using DN. It is an artistic language supported by technical tools for planning and analysis. The notation is not merely a graphical user interface for these tools, and the tools are never intended to make decisions for the director. This article introduces DN, argues its great cultural significance, provides market research results showing directors' interest in using it, and reports on two controlled experiments confirming its effectiveness—including its usability in a practical context and its ability to represent and communicate the necessary information.</p></div></div>"

This article gives an authoring framework that aims to provide structured support, from content design to final implementation. In particular, we have abstracted a conceptual model—the SandBox Serious Game - which relies on a generalization of task-based learning theory. The model invites players to perform cognitive tasks contextually while exploring information-rich virtual environments. We consider it particularly suited for cultural heritage entertainment applications. The model defines games that are set in realistic virtual worlds enriched with embedded educational tasks, which we have implemented as minigames. This approach simplifies the authoring work, which can easily be supported by visual authoring tools for ontology-based urban 3D modeling and implementation tasks, thus allowing an approach similar to the mind-maps concept. We propose a top-down methodology for content preparation, starting from a city-level analysis down to the single points of interest and associated tasks, which are instances of simple predefined minigame/quiz typologies. We provide examples and discuss criteria for selecting task typologies according to the authors' cognitive targets. Finally, we discuss the results of a user test, which took place in a lab, aimed at verifying the acquisition of cultural heritage knowledge in a pleasant and engaging way. Games appear particularly suited for supporting the study of images, especially of iconography. Compared to reading text, a game forces the player to focus more strongly on problems, which favors knowledge acquisition and retention. Learning complex concepts requires an investigative attitude, which can be spurred by well-designed games. Good design involves usability, graphic appeal, appropriate content, and the presence of connections which a player must discover in the content. Players should be asked to pay attention to and reason about their whole game activity - including the relationships between the game content, the brief introduction, and concluding texts. More comprehensive tests are needed to better investigate the educational effectiveness—however, the first results are promising, especially in terms of user motivation and creation of new opportunities for learning about CH.</p></div></div>"

Our main application is reconstruction of archaeological artifacts based on line drawings. The problem is challenging due to five reasons: the small number of orthogonal views of the object, the sparsity of the strokes, their ambiguity, their large number, and their interrelations. We partition the reconstruction problem into two subproblems. First, we reconstruct the underlying smooth base of the object from the silhouette. Assuming that the variation of bases belonging to the same class of objects is relatively small, we create the base by modifying a similar base retrieved from a database. Second, we reconstruct the relief on top of the base. Our approach can reconstruct the relief from a complex drawing that consists of many interrelated strokes. Rather than viewing the interdependencies as a problem, we show how they can be exploited to automatically generate a good initial interpretation of the line drawing. Even though our algorithm is generic, its strength is demonstrated by the reconstruction of artifacts from manual drawings taken from real archaeological reports. These drawings are highly challenging, since artists created very complex and detailed descriptions of artifacts regardless of any considerations concerning their future use for shape reconstruction.</p></div></div>"

Sherds that are found in the field usually have little to no visible textual information such as symbols, graphs, or marks on them. This makes manual classification an extremely difficult and time-consuming task for conservators and archaeologists. For a bunch of sherds found in the field, an expert identifies different classes and indicates at least one representative sherd for each class (training sample). The proposed technique uses the representative sherds in order to correctly classify the remaining sherds. For each sherd, local features based on color and texture information are extracted and are then transformed into a global vector that describes the whole sherd image, using a new bag of words technique. Finally, a feature selection algorithm is applied that locates features with high discriminative power. Extensive experiments were performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique and show very promising results.</p></div></div>"

After outlining relevant research from within and outside the heritage domain, we present our project, FINE (Fluid Interfaces for Narrative Exploration), an effort to develop such a system. Based on content from Wendy James' archive of anthropological research material from the Sudan/Ethiopian borderlands, the FINE project attempts to use structural and thematic metadata to drive exploratory interfaces which link video, images, audio, and text to relevant narrative units. The interfaces also benefit from the temporal and spatial variety of the collection to provide opportunities to discover contrasts and juxtaposition in the material across place and time.</p></div></div>"

The newly excavated remains as well as remains of the Roman city, which had already been excavated in 1954, exhibit structural damages. While at first deficiencies in the construction were assumed to be the cause of the damages, in 2003 a seismogenic origin was suggested. To further test this hypothesis of seismically induced slope movements and other possible causes, a multidisciplinary project was started. One step in this project is the documentation of the damages using a 3D laser scanner, followed by a quantitative damage analysis. This article presents the 3D documentation and the quantitative damage analysis of a recently excavated medieval cesspit. The 8.3m-deep cesspit was mapped during 11 campaigns using a phase-based 3D laser scanner. Due to the static conditions of the cesspit, the structure could not be excavated in its entirety. After the excavation of every 1-2m-section, restoration work had to be done to avoid a collapse of the construction. The laser scanning technique offered the possibility of working parallel to the excavation so the original conditions of each section could be documented before the restoration. The resulting models were used to identify, classify, and quantify the structural damages of the cesspit.</p></div></div>"

Content-based recommender systems analyze features of artworks previously rated by a visitor and build a visitor model or profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, based on those features. For example, the profile of a visitor might store the names of his or her favorite painters or painting techniques, extracted from short textual descriptions associated with artworks. The user profile is then matched against the attributes of new items in order to provide personalized suggestions. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution has changed the game for personalization from “elitist” Web 1.0, written by few and read by many, to Web content potentially generated by everyone (<i>user-generated content</i> - UGC). One of the forms of UGC that has drawn most attention from the research community is <i>folksonomy</i>, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags.</p><p>In this work, we investigate the problem of deciding whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests in the context of recommending digital artworks.

The introduction of an automated image-based coin classification system could assist numismatists in their everyday work and allow hobby numismatists to gain additional information on their coin collection by uploading images to a respective Web site. For Roman Republican coins, the inscription is one of the most significant features, and its recognition is an essential part in the successful research of an image-based coin recognition system. This article presents a novel way for the recognition of ancient Roman Republican coin legends. Traditional optical character recognition (OCR) strategies were designed for printed or handwritten texts and rely on binarization in the course of their recognition process. Since coin legends are simply embossed onto a piece of metal, they are of the same color as the background and binarization becomes error prone and prohibits the use of standard OCR. Therefore, the proposed method is based on state-of-the-art scene text recognition methods that are rooted in object recognition. S<span class=\"smallcaps smallerCapital\">ift</span> descriptors are computed for a dense grid of keypoints and are tested using support vector machines trained for each letter of the respective alphabet. Each descriptor receives a score for every letter, and the use of pictorial structures allows one to detect the optimal configuration for the lexicon words within an image; the word causing the lowest costs is recognized. Character and word recognition capabilities of the proposed method are evaluated individually; character recognition is benchmarked on three and word recognition on different datasets. Depending on the S<span class=\"smallcaps smallerCapital\">ift</span> configuration, lexicon, and dataset used, the word recognition rates range from 29% to 67%.</p></div></div>"

It also provides valuable information for ensuring the long-term preservation of cultural heritage artifacts. Consequently, as more museums develop online three-dimensional (3D) collections, curators and scholars are demanding online tools that enable them to document and interpret variances and similarities between related 3D digital objects. This article describes a system that was developed to enable museum curators and/or scholars to document relationships between multiple 3D digital representations of museum objects using web-based annotation tools. The 3D Semantic Association (3DSA) system enables users to annotate relationships between multiple whole objects, parts of objects, or features on objects (surface features or volumetric segments). The annotations are stored on a server in an interoperable format that can be shared, discovered, browsed, and retrieved through a web browser interface. This approach not only improves scholars’ capabilities to undertake cultural heritage research but also enables researchers to document, share, discuss, and compare alternative hypotheses about the relationships between artifacts.</p></div></div>"

Digital technology has been understood as merely an apparatus that can be utilized for transferring nondigital historical content to novel digital products. These products, including types such as multimedia shows, games, Web sites, and online course environments, are targeted at juvenile audiences, who are typically considered to be the primary users of such new media forms. For decades, the changes and new continuities in both mediated content and the technology of mediation were mostly hidden in the shadow of educational goal-attainment. This article draws inspiration from ideas on media archaeology and the cultures of history. In this article we suggest an approach of internal and external cultural heritage of games cultures. We introduce a four-fold table regarding the relationship between cultural heritage (or history) and digital technology. The four-fold table consists of the dimension of a researcher's comprehensive/applied goal-attainment and the dimension of the internality/externality of history and cultural heritage in regard to the digital game cultural context. Within these cultures, there are several alternative ways of discussing the relationship between history, cultural heritage, and digital technology, separate from the traditional edutainment perspective. The dimensions are illustrated with practical examples, including a typologization of historiographical computer games, retrogaming, and educational workshops on game classics.</p></div></div>"

We propose a systematic method for the domain experts to construct, with minimal effort, the knowledge base from a set of unstructured philosophy texts, and we design an algorithm to build a conversational agent emulating the conversation ability of a famous Chinese philosopher. We also report two evaluation studies on the prototype we developed, showing encouraging results on the feasibility and benefits of our approach. By automating part of the answer-finding task using natural language processing and information retrieval technology, the system is able to find answers dynamically, without the need to manually author large amounts of question and answer pairs. Our proposed method could potentially be used to create other conversational agents for educating and promoting cultural values to the general public in a natural and appealing way.</p></div></div>"

The technique described here focuses on pairwise matching of flat fragments (typically fresco fragments), and it is intended to be the core of a larger system for artifact reconstruction. Global registration techniques are challenging due to the combinatory explosion that happens in the solution space: the goal is to find the best alignment among all possible ones without an initialization. This fact defines the duality between performance and correction that we face in this work. The proposed technique defines a cost function to evaluate the quality of an alignment based on a discrete sampling of the fragments that ensures data alignment. Starting from an exhaustive search strategy, the technique progressively incorporates new features that lead to a hierarchical search strategy. Convergence and correction of the resulting technique are ensured using an optimistic cost function. Internal search calculations are optimized so the only operations performed are additions, subtractions, and comparisons over aligned data. All heavy geometric operations are carried out by the GPU on a preprocessing stage that only happens once per fragment.</p></div></div>"

The photo-realistic presentation of interactively inspectable virtual surrogates is one of the most challenging problems in this field. For this purpose, we seek to employ not only a 3D geometry but also a powerful material representation capable of reproducing the full visual appeal of an object. In this article, we propose a WebGL-based presentation framework in which reflectance information is represented via Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). Our approach works out-of-the-box in modern Web browsers and allows for the progressive transmission and interactive rendering of digitized artifacts consisting of 3D geometry and reflectance information. We handle the huge amount of data needed for this representation by employing a novel progressive streaming approach for BTFs, which allows for the smooth interactive inspection of a steadily improving version during the download. We demonstrate an interesting use-case of this technique at a cross section of Cultural Heritage, medical education, and research and provide an evaluation of the capabilities of our framework in the scope of BTF compression and transmission.</p></div></div>"

Written musical scores have transmitted basic performance information to musicians over the ages; however, these scores only provide skeletal instructions that must be fleshed out in performance, as musical notation describes phrasing, articulation, dynamics, accentuation, and other ornamentations in generalized and ambiguous forms. Consequently, musical performances derived from the same notation can vary widely from each other in the same manner that a written text may be spoken with intense emotion or in flat monotone. Prior to the advent of recording technology, musical performances were ephemeral, only occurring once, never to be heard again in exactly the same rendition. As a result, musical interpretations were informed only by live listening. Now, with more than a century of recorded performance practice, musicians can delve deeper into the history of their aural art to gain inspiration and insight from sources that would otherwise have been inaccessible. Performers have become interested in giving performances inspired by recordings of the past, which often obey a musical common sense alien to the standards of modern practice, and it is useful for historically informed performers to describe, analyze, emulate, and internalize the performance styles of the past through the detailed study of recordings. Although much can be learned by listening, a visual interface may reveal potentially inaudible details of a recording. Because performers interact daily with traditional musical notation—a sophisticated, if ambiguous, multidimensional visualization of musical information—one approach to the design of such an interface leverages performers' existing knowledge by reducing the gap between data visualization and traditional musical notation as much as possible. Using Abjad, a Python-based tool for musical composition, the symbols of conventional staff notation are augmented to illustrate the intensity and temporal proximity of performed musical events graphically, thus facilitating the comparison of individual performances and the study of changes in performance aesthetics over time.</p></div></div>"

Commonly used techniques include hyperspectral imaging, 3D scanning, and medical computed tomography imaging. However, viewing most of this digital image data frequently requires both specialized software, which is often associated with a particular type of acquisition device, and professional knowledge of and experience with each type of data. In addition, many of these software packages are focused on particular applications (such as medicine or remote sensing) and do not permit users to access and fully exploit all the information contained in the data. In this paper, we address two practical barriers to using high-tech digital data in art conservation. First, users must deal with a wide variety of interfaces specialized for applications besides conservation. We provide an open-source software tool with a single intuitive interface consistent with conservators' needs that handles various types of 2D and 3D image data and preserves user-generated metadata and annotations. Second, previous software has largely allowed visualizing a single type or only a few types of data. The software we present is designed and structured to accommodate multiple types of digital imaging data, including as yet unspecified or unimplemented formats, in an integrated environment. This allows conservators to access different forms of information and to view a variety of image types simultaneously.</p></div></div>"

A new descriptor characterizing point features for identifying corresponding points in datasets is presented. The merging process is based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which enables calculation of the geometric transformation between point clouds based on a set of interest points that includes incorrect samples, called outliers. The proposed processing path is designed to integrate many directional measurements, which are acquired with a 3D scanner and are represented as unsorted point clouds (x, y, z) with color information (R, G, B). Exemplary measurements shown in this article represent sections of ceiling in the King's Chinese Cabinet of the Museum of King Jan III's Palace at Wilanow in Warsaw, Poland, as well as some more complex objects. Experimental verification confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in integrating directional measurements of objects with detailed texture, particularly if they have no unique geometric features.</p></div></div>"

These knowledge and skills constitute intangible cultural heritage and refer to the fruit of diverse expertise founded and propagated over the centuries thanks to the ingeniousness of the gesture and the creativity of the human spirit. Nowadays, this expertise is very often threatened with disappearance because of the difficulty to resist globalization and the fact that most of those “expertise holders” are not easily accessible due to geographical or other constraints. In this article, a methodological framework for capturing and modeling gestural knowledge and skills in wheel-throwing pottery is proposed. It is based on capturing gestures using wireless inertial sensors and statistical modeling. In particular, we used a system that allows for online alignment of gestures using a modified Hidden Markov Model. This methodology is implemented into a human--computer interface, which permits both the modeling and recognition of expert technical gestures. This system could be used to assist in the learning of these gestures by giving continuous feedback in real time by measuring the difference between expert and learner gestures. The system has been tested and evaluated on different potters with rare expertise, which is strongly related to their local identity.</p></div></div>"

We conceive a virtual reconstruction as a digital ecosystem, whose main peculiarities are (1) 3D reconstruction, (2) inclusivity, and (3) interactivity. A virtual reconstruction, in a wide sense, should integrate different levels of visualization, both realistic and symbolic; 3D models; metadata; storytelling; behaviors; and tools of visualization and interaction, in order to “reconstruct” and communicate a cultural context, an ecosystem where all the information is integrated. Despite the great advancements of the last years in the digitization process, computer graphics techniques, and archiving strategies, a basic limit of most of virtual museums is that they do not fire up the attention and the involvement of the public: they lack stimulating activities for visitors, narratives metaphors, and emotional impact. The interaction interfaces are not always simple to understand and to control in a few minutes, and they can generate a sense of frustration that causes users to abandon the application after a short and superficial approach. No gap should exist between knowledge and communication. But how can we translate the complexity of the knowledge in appealing to users and into simple applications that fit with the public's need? This article focuses on some communication rules and criteria that are often considered of minor importance by the researchers working in the field of digital cultural heritage but that are really essential to cultural transmission, especially inside museums. We believe that a stronger collaboration between research institutions and museums and among different disciplines would be recommended. Given this premise, we present the Etruscanning EU project, developed in 2011--2013, focused on the virtual reconstruction of two important Etruscan tombs of the Orientalizing period: the Regolini-Galassi tomb in Cerveteri and the tomb n.5 of Monte Michele in Veii.</p></div></div>"

Most of the developments concern metrical and colorimetric characteristics of the objects studied. These developments, surrounding the practice of architectural survey, tend to respond primarily to the requirements of completeness. In this context, it seems necessary to assess the impact of these instruments on the cognitive value of architectural representation. With a strong technological presence, the study of the built heritage is facing a problem of “information overload.” Indeed, this strong technological presence fails to strengthen representation in its role as a vehicle of knowledge. Confronted with the intelligibility deficit, this article proposes an original approach for reading morphological features of an artifact by using a bottom-up approach: the meaning of elements (i.e., their semantic layouts) come from a statistical analysis of the major shape discontinuities of a collection of instances. The idea is to rely on data accumulation to render apparent high-level semantic structures from the comparative analysis of common low-level geometric features. The principles introduced are illustrated by the study of 31 columns of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa. To summarize, the first objective is to understand how digital technologies can help us in the analysis of artistic and technical production of Romanesque columns. The second objective is to automatically identify the common semantic articulations of the entire collection to build a reference model for the future assessment of each artifact.</p></div></div>"

In this article, we present the work done in the framework of the “Visionary Cross” project, starting from the digitization of the Ruthwell Cross to the creation of a web-based digital edition of <i>The Dream of the Rood</i>, as it is carved on the Cross. The 3D data has been collected and processed with the explicit aim of creating a multimedia framework able to present the highly detailed digital model acquired with 3D scanning technology, together with the transcription and translation of the runes that can be found on its surface. The textual and spatial information are linked through a system of bidirectional links called Spots, which allow the users to navigate freely over the multimedia content, keeping the 3D and textual data synchronized. The present work discusses the different issues that arose during the work, from digitization and processing to the design of a tool for the integration of three-dimensional content in the context of the presentation on the web platform of heterogeneous multimedia data.

This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont’e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports.

Digitization plays an important role in the process of creating, preserving, and accessing objects in digital space. Up to the present day, industrial scanners are used for this task, which focus mainly on the detailed reconstruction of the object’s geometry only. However, particularly important for a faithful digital presentation of the object is the appearance information—that is, a description of the used materials and how they interact with incident light. Using the world’s first full-spherical scanner, we propose a user-friendly reconstruction process that is specifically tailored to the needs of digitizing and representing cultural heritage artifacts. More precisely, our hardware specifically addresses the problem that invaluable or fragile artifacts may not be turned over during acquisition. Nevertheless, we can digitize the object completely, including its bottom. Further, by integrating appearance information into our digitization, we achieve a far more faithful digital replica with a quality comparable to a real picture of the object. But in contrast to a static picture, our representation allows one to interactively change the viewing and lighting directions freely. In addition, the results are very memory efficient, consuming only several megabytes per scanned object. In cooperation with museums and a private collector, we digitized several cultural heritage artifacts to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed process.</p></div></div>"

However, only a small fraction of the total production of texts from ancient Greece and Rome has survived up to the present, leaving many gaps in the historiographic records. Epigraphy, which is the study of inscriptions (epigraphs), helps to fill these gaps. In particular, the goal of epigraphy is to clarify the meanings of epigraphs; to classify their uses according to their dating and cultural contexts; and to study aspects of the writing, the writers, and their “consumers.” Although several research projects have recently been promoted for digitally storing and retrieving data and metadata about epigraphs, there has actually been no attempt to apply data mining technologies to discover previously unknown cultural aspects. In this context, we propose to exploit the temporal dimension associated with epigraphs (dating) by applying a data mining method for novelty detection. The main goal is to discover relational novelty patterns—that is, patterns expressed as logical clauses describing significant variations (in frequency) over the different epochs, in terms of relevant features such as language, writing style, and material. As a case study, we considered the set of <i>Inscriptiones Christianae Vrbis Romae</i> stored in Epigraphic Database Bari, an epigraphic repository. Some patterns discovered by the data mining method were easily deciphered by experts since they captured relevant cultural changes, whereas others disclosed unexpected variations, which might be used to formulate new questions, thus expanding the research opportunities in the field of epigraphy.</p></div></div>"

The main goal is to create an ad hoc packaging software solution by combining the use of 3D scanning and 3D milling technologies. Traditionally, packaging for this kind of object is made manually, creating custom supports and boxes adapted to the specific needs and particularities of each case. This process is time consuming and fully depends on the conservator’s skills. On the other hand, the proposed solution provides a faster execution and a standard solution adapted to every object. The process starts with the acquisition of 3D digital models of the original artifacts and uses an interactive GPU-accelerated algorithm to assist the conservator in the construction of the package. The final result is a CNC program that is sent to a low-cost milling machine to produce the housing for the selected artifact. Unlike 3D printers, milling machines allow working with lots of different materials, which is a key aspect for this kind of package: chemical stability and shock absorption are mandatory. Given that during the design process original artifacts are only manipulated in the acquisition stage, risks of damaging them are also reduced. Since the whole process is considered in the same application, intermediate calculations are performed considering manufacturing and user-defined restrictions. This way, together with a GPU implementation, achieved results are very fast, providing a real-time application with visual feedback.</p></div></div>"

However, information reliability evaluation is discussed in many disciplines such as history, Arabic storytelling, and computer science. Although these disciplines share common principles, they differ in many aspects, which are studied in this article. However, we mainly focus on two disciplines. On the one hand, Arabic storytelling stands by rigid rules for transmitting information and inspecting sources and contents. On the other hand, the characteristics of the Web as a collaborative, open and vast area for information sharing has caused changes in our evaluation of information. This article studies related works to enumerate the main principles and steps that constitute guidelines for automatic information reliability evaluation. Finally, these guidelines are applied to Arabic storytelling, and experimental results are presented.</p></div></div>"

In most cases, however, the description is qualitative. An improvement of the study of archaeological pottery needs a more objective approach with quantitative analysis. In classical scientific literature, the structural features and mineralogical composition of pottery are carried out on thin sections by means of transmitted polarized light microscope. The determination were obtained through observations with and without cross polarizator (nicols). The quantitative measurements are normally achieved with tedious and time consuming table with point counter. In this article the attention has been focused on the automatic identification of structural and textural components of the potteries through optical microscopy. Image analysis techniques have been then used to automatically classify the image components. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach: petrographic data collection becomes faster with respect to the traditional method providing also quantitative information useful for fabric recognition.</p></div></div>"

Understanding the knowledge and practice of textile production as a form of cultural heritage is particularly relevant in the Andean context due to erosion of clothing traditions, reuse of traditional textiles on commodities targeted at the tourism market, and loss of knowledge embedded in textile production. “Weaving Communities of Practice” was a pilot project that aimed to create a knowledge base of Andean weaving designed to contribute to curatorial practice and heritage policy. The research team gathered data on the chain of activities, instruments, resources, peoples, places and knowledge involved in the production of textiles, relating to over 700 textile samples. A major part of the project has been the modelling and representation of the knowledge of domain experts and information about the textile objects themselves in the form of an OWL ontology, and the development of a suite of search facilities to be supported by the ontology. This paper describes the research challenges faced in developing the ontology and search facilities, the methodology adopted, the design and implementation of the system, and the design and outcomes of a user evaluation of the system undertaken with a group of domain experts.</p></div></div>"

Different methods have been adopted up to now for the automatic detection of dust and scratches; each method has pros and cons, and a limited field of effectiveness. The use of infrared radiation and the spatiotemporal image analysis are among the most effective methods, although they have their limits. The infrared radiation only works for dye-based material, while the spatiotemporal image analysis is not applicable for still images and is limited due to motion in the scene. The present work defines in detail a set of methods for optical dust and scratches detection applicable on any type of transparent photographic material (silver-based as well as dye-based material, still images as well as moving images). The term “optical” refers to the fact that the considered methods seek physical evidence of the presence of foreign bodies or irregularities on the film; this allows avoiding the typical digital artifacts produced by “nonoptical” methods, for which certain elements of the scenes are erroneously obliterated because they resemble dust grains or scratches. “PDD” (Polarized Dark-field Detection) detects the flaws using an image acquired in a polarized dark-field setup; “DCD” (Dual Collimation Detection) takes advantage of the Callier effect to locate the flaws; “<i>n</i>-MDD” (Multiple Direction Detection) entails the acquisition of <i>n</i> images in dark-field setups with different directions of illumination, and the extraction of the differences between the images through multivariate analysis. A numerical evaluation of the performances of the MDD method with an eightfold acquisition (8-MDD) is carried out by comparing its flaw detection with the flaw detection provided by commercial software based on spatiotemporal image analysis.</p></div></div>"

The proposed framework utilizes Image-Based Rendering (IBR), which enables users to freely change their viewpoint in a real-world virtualization constructed using precaptured images. This framework combines the offline rendering of virtual objects and IBR to take advantage of the higher quality of offline rendering without the additional computational cost of online processing; that is, it incurs only the cost of online lightweight IBR, which is simplified through the pregeneration of structured viewpoints (e.g., at grid points).</p></div></div>"

The aim of this article is to present some consideration on factors that could facilitate cultural learning in virtual heritage environment. Cultural learning in the context of this study refers to the acquisition of knowledge that encourages cultural awareness and appreciation. In this study, we explore virtual heritage environment design features, and cultural information characteristics and presentation formats that are important to facilitate cultural learning, from the casual user's perspective. We conducted experiments that required users to explore virtual heritage environments (focusing on architectural heritage) from selected heritage-related websites, followed by interview sessions. Four contributing factors were identified: information design, information presentation, navigation mechanism, and environment setting. The results suggest the need to reduce users’ cognitive load when exploring virtual heritage environments while simultaneously presenting information that adds value to their understanding. The results also suggest that the inclusion of cultural information in virtual heritage environments is essential for cultural learning to take place.</p></div></div>"

These are particularly interesting problems in archaeology, as pottery comprises a great volume of findings in archaeological excavations. Indeed, the analysis of potsherds brings relevant cues for understanding the culture of ancient groups. In particular, we develop a new local shape descriptor for 3D surfaces, called the <i>histogram of spherical orientations</i> (HoSO), which we use in combination with a bag-of-words approach to compute visual similarity between 3D surfaces. Given a point of interest on a 3D surface, its local shape descriptor (HoSO) captures the distribution of the spherical orientations of its neighboring points. In turn, those spherical orientations are computed with respect to the point of interest itself, both in the azimuth and the zenith axis. The proposed HoSO is invariant to scale transformations and highly robust to rotation and noise. In addition, it is efficient, as it only exploits the information of the position of the 3D points and disregards other types of information like faces or normals. We performed experiments on a set of 3D surfaces representing potsherds from the Teotihuacan civilization and further validations on a set of 3D models of generic objects. Our results show that our methodology is effective for describing 3D models and that it improves classification performance with respect to previous local descriptors.</p></div></div>"

In fact, the preservation of archaeological objects has always been an issue of concern for the research community. On the one hand, the fragility of the objects limits their study. On the other hand, such objects are housed in museums, libraries, and institutions worldwide, locations that significantly limit their accessibility. Different survey methods have been carried out in these attempts to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Among them, the MicMac open source software was used in this work to survey and process the dense correlation of the hieroglyphics inscriptions engraved on archaeological stones. Relatively standard workflows have led to depth maps, which can be represented either as 3D point clouds or shaded relief images. This article shows the application of this method in two epigraphic survey case studies.</p></div></div>"

This article studies two types of shape representations in a bag-of-words-based pipeline to recognize Maya glyphs. The first is a knowledge-driven Histogram of Orientation Shape Context (HOOSC) representation, and the second is a data-driven representation obtained by applying an unsupervised Sparse Autoencoder (SA). In addition to the glyph data, the generalization ability of the descriptors is investigated on a larger-scale sketch dataset. The contributions of this article are four-fold: (1) the evaluation of the performance of a data-driven auto-encoder approach for shape representation; (2) a comparative study of hand-designed HOOSC and data-driven SA; (3) an experimental protocol to assess the effect of the different parameters of both representations; and (4) bridging humanities and computer vision/machine learning for Maya studies, specifically for visual analysis of glyphs. From our experiments, the data-driven representation performs overall in par with the hand-designed representation for similar locality sizes on which the descriptor is computed. We also observe that a larger number of hidden units, the use of average pooling, and a larger training data size in the SA representation all improved the descriptor performance. Additionally, the characteristics of the data and stroke size play an important role in the learned representation.</p></div></div>"

Our focus is a common architectural type in Mediterranean sites, the Doric column drum, which we investigate at one of the earliest Doric temples in the Greek world, the Hera temple at Olympia. The 3D modeling and analysis of this building by the Digital Architecture Project since 2013 has revealed new insights into the construction history of its stone colonnades. This paper concerns the analysis of the 3D models of the <i>in situ</i> material, using the almost 100 fallen drums and capitals to reconstruct the colonnade digitally. In order to accomplish this, we propose two novel methods for training the machine to estimate the dimensions of a fragmentary column drum. One approach is a modification of ICP, where the fragment is compared to an ideal model of an intact drum, which is resized iteratively until concluding with a satisfactory fit. Another approach recasts the scan data into polar coordinates and uses RANSAC to identify the exterior profiles of the piece and remove points likely to belong to damaged areas. The filtered points are then examined by the algorithm to estimate the radii and taper of the drum. Besides saving a great deal of time in the field, these methods are also accurate to within 0.2% of the total radius for well-preserved material, and 1% for even the most fragmentary drums at Olympia. These data have allowed the digital reconstruction of 80% of the displaced drums and all of the capitals from the temple. Our algorithms can be used to measure any fluted column drums, and we discuss the potential value of our approach for other categories of archaeological artifacts.</p></div></div>"

We present a rule-based approach for generation of ancient Chinese architectures from the Song dynasty. Based on the special module system and the hierarchical topology of structural patterns in traditional Chinese architectures, the approach parameterizes the wooden elements of buildings and formalizes the construction rules for different architecture styles. In the approach, XML-based description files are generated for displaying the construction process. What the approach generates are standard architectures that strictly follow the ancient Chinese governmental manual. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, architectures in different styles have been generated based on their corresponding rules. The fundamental difference between our approach and previous works is that we apply and implement the module system in digitalization of ancient Chinese architecture.</p></div></div>"

With technology resources and the convergence of media such as text, data, maps, charts, pictures, and virtual models, among others, cultural heritage can be celebrated, contemplated, and admired more easily. However, creating an application for reactivation of cultural heritage by citizens remains a challenge because there is no clear methodology to be followed for its development. As far as we know, no one has proposed a methodological framework for applications in this field to determine which aspects should be considered and which tools should be used to successfully develop a cultural heritage application. This article proposes a methodological framework that allows a developer to categorize the type of cultural heritage application to develop and determine which types and quality of resources should be used in the application to provide good usability while fitting project requirements. The methodology is applied for the reactivation of Cisneros marketplace at Medellin, in Colombia, as a case study for testing the framework proposed.
