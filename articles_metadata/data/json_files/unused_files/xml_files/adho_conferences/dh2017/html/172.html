<p><span class="font3">Understanding narrative structure at a large scale remains a challenging problem within the field of cultural analytics and computational linguistics. Our aim&nbsp;with this project is to develop novel methods to study&nbsp;the pacing of narrative scene changes and the overall&nbsp;distribution of different plotlines within novels. Being&nbsp;able to analyze such narrative features at large scale&nbsp;can give us insights into the way different genres,&nbsp;time periods, or cultures favor different modes of storytelling. In this project we formalize definitions of&nbsp;narrative scenes and implement new methods of detection and clustering using computational methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The project involves three steps: creating an operational concept of a narrative frame; the algorithmic segmentation of narratives by frames; and the predictive clustering of frames into larger-scale “plotlines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We define a “frame” as a significant shift of three variables in a given text window: entities, actions, and&nbsp;objects, which we represent using POS tagging as&nbsp;proper names, verbs, and nouns. We measure significant lexical shift of our three primary variables in a&nbsp;sliding textual window of 1000 words with increments of 100-word shifts. We test window-size and&nbsp;variable selection relative to human annotation to&nbsp;determine the best performing model. We resolve&nbsp;frames into “plotlines” using hierarchical clustering,&nbsp;also demonstrated in our poster. “Frames” serve as&nbsp;inferred textual units and “plotlines” as aggregated&nbsp;clusters of frames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have tested the performance of different combination of variable selection on nine 12,000-word passages from novels of different genres from a range&nbsp;of time periods (from 1818 to 2011). To date, our algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art in&nbsp;Hearst's Texttiling algorithm (1994; 1997) when it&nbsp;comes to placing breaks in the narrative event progression. The performance of our system relative to&nbsp;human performance on the same task (F1 82%, Precision 81%, Recall 86%), shows an F1 score of 69%&nbsp;with 71% precision and 67% recall, where % annotators agreement is considered to be a true frame&nbsp;boundary. Hearst's method applied to the same problem performs at a significantly lower rate (F1 18%,&nbsp;Precision 18%, Recall 19%). While the overall problem remains challenging we show significant improvement over state of the art systems at detecting&nbsp;narrative segments. Nevertheless, the imperfect accuracy suggests that scene changes have a number of&nbsp;subtle variables that are not exclusively tied to vocabulary or character shifts, which indicate further avenues for future research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our poster will present our formalization of narrative events, the results and approach of the segmentation task and the clustering models used. We see this project as a crucial contribution to the larger study of&nbsp;narrative form across different literary genres and&nbsp;time periods.</span></p>
