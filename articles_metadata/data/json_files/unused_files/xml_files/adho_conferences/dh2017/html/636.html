<p><span class="font1">How can text mining further explore and challenge our conception of how the style of British travel writing changed from 1700 to 1830? In this poster, drawn&nbsp;from the first chapter of my dissertation, I use text&nbsp;mining methods to explore the purported coming&nbsp;forth of the self in eighteenth-century travel writing,&nbsp;examining texts ranging from instructions for gentlemen and antiquarian accounts to the documents of&nbsp;New World explorers and the journals of female travelers. Increasing public demand for travel-related&nbsp;texts and the genre's potential for experimenting and&nbsp;examining social, philosophical, and aesthetic ideas elevated travel literature to one of the most important -and popular - genres of the century. Despite the modern broadening of the definition of travel literature&nbsp;and analyses that use the lenses of feminism and postcolonialism, however, overviews of travel writing still&nbsp;primarily use close readings and representative samples of texts to make claims about the genre as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My project, however, will use a corpus of more than 3500 texts (curated through a combination of existing&nbsp;bibliographies and machine learning methods) to examine and challenge our received literary histories of&nbsp;the genre. In particular, this presentation focuses on&nbsp;the “I” and autobiography in narration. In the first half&nbsp;of the eighteenth century, authors crafted travel texts&nbsp;to have a balanced amount of personal narration: the&nbsp;voice of the narrator was required to provide order,&nbsp;entertainment, and authority in the narrative, but with&nbsp;an over-emphatic voice, the author would appear egotistical, fantastical, and unreliable. By the middle of the&nbsp;century, however, scholars identify a trend of authors&nbsp;increasingly writing in a first-person voice and interpolating their detached, factual observations with&nbsp;their personal experiences and reflections. Around the&nbsp;turn of the century, when many locations, particularly&nbsp;Grand Tour destinations like France and Italy, had&nbsp;been described multiple times, readers desired more&nbsp;original writing and critics used personal narration as&nbsp;evidence that the author had actually travelled. Still,&nbsp;authors often felt they had to justify writing in a distinctive voice: Mary Wollstonecraft, when she found&nbsp;she could not “avoid being continually the first per-son—‘the little hero of each tale,'” became “determined to let [her] remarks and reflections flow unrestrained” (3). In this poster, therefore, I seek to examine this purported coming forth of the self in eighteenth-century travel literature. Tracking distributions&nbsp;of pronouns, such as “I,” “me,” and “you,” and other&nbsp;narrative signifiers will reveal the shifting trends of&nbsp;personal narration in my corpus. Analyzing the words&nbsp;used in titles—such as “Observations,” “Reflections,”&nbsp;and epistolary markers, among others—may provide&nbsp;further insight into how authors and publishers conceptualized and marketed the relationship between&nbsp;the author, the narrator, and the reading public. In examining such patterns, I seek to answer questions&nbsp;such as whether the pieces we consider more “literary” use the first-person voice more often or more experimentally, whether particular sub-genres or texts&nbsp;in my corpus are more likely than others to follow this&nbsp;trend, and whether any other shifts in grammar and&nbsp;vocabulary accompanied this new privileging of firstperson narration. A corollary question is whether</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sterne’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sentimental Journey</span><span class="font1"> is, as several critics contend, truly a catalyst for this trend, and how the influence of Sterne and other significant authors manifest in my corpus. In particular, I will pay close attention to&nbsp;female writers and authors of colour, following the&nbsp;work of critics such as Elizabeth Bohls, in order to see&nbsp;how they subvert and support the trends of travel&nbsp;writing at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This first chapter on the self, along with my dissertation’s examinations of descriptive language and subgenre, will provide an extensive understanding of eighteenth-century British travel writing. My approach encourages both breadth and depth in subject&nbsp;material, from patterns across hundreds of texts to significant paragraphs, sentences and words. This mixture of distant and close reading will offer a reformulation of the massive genre by, for the first time, analyzing a significantly larger corpus than was previously possible. My findings and methodology (shared&nbsp;through Github and other public forums) will provide&nbsp;critical resources and frameworks for future investigations of the language and genre of other forms of&nbsp;eighteenth-century literatures.</span></p>
