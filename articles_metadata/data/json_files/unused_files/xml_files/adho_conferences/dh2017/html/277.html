<p><span class="font6">Since fall 2001, the Chicago Public Library (CPL) has chosen fiction and nonfiction around which to&nbsp;organize city-wide public events, book discussions,&nbsp;and other creative programming. This “One Book One&nbsp;Chicago” (OBOC) program has been a successful&nbsp;ongoing civic initiative with great public visibility,&nbsp;with participants ranging from the Mayor of Chicago&nbsp;to countless book group volunteers across the city. Our&nbsp;“Reading Chicago Reading” project—supported by the&nbsp;National Endowment for the Humanities Office of&nbsp;Digital Humanities and Microsoft—works to discover&nbsp;how text characteristics, library branch demographics,&nbsp;and promotional activities are linked variables that&nbsp;can be used to predict patron response to future OBOC&nbsp;titles. The OBOC program acts as a recurring&nbsp;experiment in data capture, for each chosen work&nbsp;represents a probe into library usage and, by&nbsp;extension, a window onto the elective reading&nbsp;behavior of the diverse patrons of a major American&nbsp;city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This paper will report comparative circulation data for three recent OBOC choices that are Chicago-centered and three that are not Chicago-centered. The&nbsp;three Chicago-centered books are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Augie March</span><span class="font6"> (1953) by&nbsp;Saul Bellow</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Warmth of the Other Suns</span><span class="font6"> (2011) by&nbsp;Isabel Wilkerson</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Third Coast</span><span class="font6"> (2014), by Thomas Dyja</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The three recent non-Chicago OBOC choices are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Book Thief</span><span class="font6"> (2007) by Markus Zusak</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(2000) by Michael Chabon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</span><span class="font6"> (2010) by Yiyun Li</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are keen to answer whether a Chicago setting and, more particularly, particular measures of&nbsp;linguistic sentiment about Chicago people and places,&nbsp;have measurable influence on the popularity of books&nbsp;across Chicago. Specifically, we are interested in&nbsp;examining the question of whether “Chicago” books,&nbsp;fictional and nonfictional, checked out in greater&nbsp;numbers when they feature characters, events, and&nbsp;places situated close to the readers’ own&nbsp;neighborhood library branch? (We use CPL library&nbsp;branch as a proxy for patron home address, which we&nbsp;cannot know from the library system’s anonymized&nbsp;checkout data.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The results of this analysis have the potential to provide empirical answers to long-standing questions&nbsp;in digital humanities research: in his Atlas of the&nbsp;European Novel 1800-1900, for example, Franco&nbsp;Moretti speculated that perhaps “fictional spaces are&nbsp;particularly suited to happy endings,” but did not have&nbsp;hard numbers to judge one way or the other at the&nbsp;time (18 n.6). More recently, in The Bestseller Code,&nbsp;Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers argue that “while it&nbsp;does matter whether an author chooses a city or the&nbsp;wilderness, the specific city does not matter all that&nbsp;much when it comes to bestselling” (227). Our&nbsp;sentiment analysis findings will contribute to open&nbsp;research questions: maybe in fact the city matters&nbsp;when readers are in that city, and when the places and&nbsp;people in that same city are written about in particular&nbsp;linguistic registers. If literary form and real geography&nbsp;do have detectable ties to one another, our project&nbsp;ought to be able to capture the effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To compare the circulation pattern of non-Chicago and Chicago-related OBOC books, we used one year of&nbsp;city-wide circulation data for each book, starting with&nbsp;the date of the title’s public announcement as the&nbsp;OBOC choice. This data was normalized by dividing the&nbsp;circulation raw numbers with the total number of&nbsp;visitors for that year and multiplying the result by&nbsp;1000. Normalizing by the number of circulated copies&nbsp;was sometimes difficult because some branches did&nbsp;not have any copies (but could borrow them from&nbsp;other branches). Given that libraries oftentimes&nbsp;allocate books based on the size of the library and&nbsp;based on the number of visitors, we decided to</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font6">normalize by the overall number of visitors. Distribution patterns for Chicago and non-Chicago&nbsp;related sets of books are represented through the&nbsp;histograms and QQ plots in Figure 1. As this analysis&nbsp;indicates, the circulation distribution across 79&nbsp;Chicago library branches does not follow bell-shape&nbsp;distribution and is positively skewed. The Wilcoxon&nbsp;signed rank test was used to test to what degree the&nbsp;difference in the distribution for these two sets can be&nbsp;attributed to chance.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font3">1000 visitors for non-Chicago related and Chicago related books. Below, the QQ plots for non-Chicago and Chicago&nbsp;related books checkouts.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font6">Results indicate that the probability that the difference in the circulation distribution across 79 Chicago&nbsp;library branches for the two (paired) sets of books can&nbsp;be attributed to chance is very low (p &lt; .01).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div><img src="277_files/277-4.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:188pt;"/>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 2. The y-axis indicates the difference in the checkouts (1-year of circulation data) for three Chicago related and three non-Chicago related books.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font6">The y-axis in Figure 2 represents the difference between the checkouts per 1000 visitors for Chicago&nbsp;related and non-Chicago related books. Figure 2&nbsp;indicates that the three non-Chicago related books</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font6">circulated more than the set of Chicago related books in some library branches in the Chicago area (where&nbsp;the line drops into negative difference). In some&nbsp;branches, however, the difference is almost minimal.&nbsp;The plot also indicates that, in some branches, the&nbsp;OBOC Chicago-related choices had, in fact, more&nbsp;checkouts than the non-Chicago OBOC choices (where&nbsp;the difference is positive). Although it is difficult to&nbsp;establish which factors contribute to this difference in&nbsp;circulation and although we cannot attribute this&nbsp;difference between the two distributions to the mere&nbsp;fact that one set contains references to Chicago&nbsp;whereas the other does not, we plan to represent the&nbsp;library branches that are associated with a larger&nbsp;number of checkouts for Chicago non-related books&nbsp;and those that are associated with a larger number of&nbsp;related books on the Chicago map and analyze them&nbsp;against the sociodemographic and socioeconomic&nbsp;characteristics of different branches (obtained from&nbsp;the American Community Survey data). In the future,&nbsp;we plan to add more Chicago related books to the&nbsp;analysis and observe how this may affect this observed&nbsp;pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A further question of interest to us is, do the sentiment measures for these texts map in consistent&nbsp;ways for different neighborhoods? To examine these&nbsp;questions, we rely on Stanford CoreNLP natural&nbsp;language processing capabilities (Manning et al., 2014,&nbsp;<a href="http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/</a>). Given that&nbsp;the identification of places and locations is important&nbsp;for our analysis, we use a tool that has consistently&nbsp;achieved good rankings and, in general, boasts&nbsp;superior accuracy rates when compared to other&nbsp;named entity recognizers (Rodriquez et al., 2012;&nbsp;Atdag &amp; Labatut, 2013): the Stanford Named Entity&nbsp;Recognizer, a part of the CoreNLP suite of tools. Before&nbsp;running the named entity recognizer, the text is first&nbsp;tokenized into sentences using the NLTK sentence&nbsp;tokenizer (<a href="http://www.nltk.org/">http://www.nltk.org/</a>). The CoreNLP&nbsp;program then tokenizes sentences into words,&nbsp;identifies lemma for each individual word, uses the&nbsp;Penn Treebank part of speech information (Toutanova&nbsp;&amp; Manning, 2000), and also notes Persons, Locations,&nbsp;Time Reference, and Numbers in the sentences (Finkel&nbsp;et al., 2005). We are specifically interested in locations&nbsp;as this category would not only identify Chicago as a&nbsp;location but also its streets and landmark buildings.&nbsp;For sentiment analysis, we are using the Stanford&nbsp;sentiment analysis tool (Socher et al., 2013)—also&nbsp;part of the Stanford CoreNLP—to annotate each&nbsp;sentence with the sentiment score on the following&nbsp;scale: Very Positive, Positive Neutral, Negative, Very&nbsp;Negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Preliminary analysis on the sentiment associated with sentences that contain the word Chicago in the&nbsp;three Chicago-related books is indicated in Figure 3:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sentiment association of the sentences that contain the word 'Chicago'</span></p><img src="277_files/277-5.jpg" style="width:175pt;height:133pt;"/>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 3 Sentiment distribution of sentences that contain the word Chicago in Augie March, The Warmth of Other Suns,&nbsp;and The Third Coast</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The raw count of sentences with their sentiment ratings was normalized by the total number of&nbsp;sentences that contain the word Chicago. Noticeable in&nbsp;Figure 3 is that although these three books differ&nbsp;according to genre, and although they differ in terms&nbsp;of topical coverage and date of publication, we see a&nbsp;rather similar sentiment score pattern with respect to&nbsp;sentences that contain the word Chicago. We suspect&nbsp;that this overall similarity pattern will start to change&nbsp;as we dig deeper into the location data: we must note&nbsp;here that this initial analysis above does not yet take&nbsp;into account local references such as Pizzeria Uno,&nbsp;Pullman, the South Side, Monroe Street, and the like,&nbsp;but do not also use the word Chicago in the sentence.&nbsp;We plan to obtain a set of place names associated with&nbsp;Chicago through resources such as Open Street Maps&nbsp;and GeoNames and search for all the occurrences of&nbsp;Chicago place names. Additionally, we plan to use the&nbsp;indexes in the back of some of the books as trusted&nbsp;sources of local place names.</span></p>
