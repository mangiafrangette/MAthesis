<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This paper reports on efforts to integrate cultural critique into a DH project that analyzes a corpus of&nbsp;book-length comics, or graphic narratives. We argue&nbsp;that the analysis of issues such as gender, race, and&nbsp;class should be central to digital scholarship that&nbsp;aims to become accessible to the public and appear&nbsp;relevant to the humanities at large. Therefore,&nbsp;cultural criticism needs to be integrated into digital&nbsp;projects from the very beginning. Our research takes&nbsp;up calls to “design for difference” and to develop&nbsp;visualizations that “enact [the] humanistic&nbsp;properties” of complexity and contradiction&nbsp;(McPherson and Drucker, 242). Part I looks at the&nbsp;construction of a corpus of graphic novels, memoirs,&nbsp;and non-fiction. Basing our corpus on academic&nbsp;databases, international comics awards, literary&nbsp;histories, and online booksellers provides insight&nbsp;into institutional gender and racial biases, as well as&nbsp;the opportunity to address them. Part II takes up&nbsp;Drucker's criticism of network analysis as reductive&nbsp;and static. We present networks of a pilot corpus&nbsp;that pay attention to social inequality and replace&nbsp;reductive edges with distinct forms of&nbsp;communication. Part II exemplifies our intention to&nbsp;make DH scholarship relevant to a wider public. The&nbsp;broad appeal of comics presents an ideal point of&nbsp;entry for people who might not otherwise be&nbsp;interested in digital research. We apply the popular&nbsp;Bechdel Test (proposed by Alison Bechdel in a comic&nbsp;strip but used mainly to study film and TV), to&nbsp;highlight the male bias of graphic narratives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Corpus Analysis of Institutional Gender and Racial Bias</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The traditional canon of literary studies has long been criticized for its exclusion of female, non-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Western, and minority authors. As a much younger field, comics studies lacks the extensive canons and&nbsp;bibliographies produced by literary historians. This&nbsp;does not mean that similar biases are absent,&nbsp;however. As part of a larger project, we have built a&nbsp;monitor corpus of book-length comics by drawing on&nbsp;sources that include academic databases (JSTOR,&nbsp;MLA), international comics awards, literary and&nbsp;cultural histories of comics, news media coverage,&nbsp;and Amazon.com (Dunst et al.). Of 220 titles&nbsp;included in the corpus by fall 2016, 84 per cent were&nbsp;written by male authors and 73 per cent were&nbsp;identified as white. Biases are unevenly distributed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gender per Source</span></p><img src="047_files/047-1.jpg" style="width:215pt;height:126pt;"/>

<p><span class="font1">Figure 2: Ethnicity of issue's author grouped by book's source</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The absence of reliable bibliographies means that the size, gender and racial make-up of the population&nbsp;remains uncertain. Yet given the considerable&nbsp;differences between sources, institutional biases&nbsp;appear likely. To address these existing biases, two&nbsp;steps were undertaken. A survey sent to comics&nbsp;scholars (five female, five male) asked them to&nbsp;suggest between five and ten graphic narratives&nbsp;written by women that should be included in the&nbsp;corpus. Of a total of 53 suggestions by nine&nbsp;respondents, nine volumes were listed by more than&nbsp;one scholar and 12 had already been included in the&nbsp;corpus, while 14 fell outside of the sampling frame.&nbsp;16 new works were added, bringing the ratio of&nbsp;female author to slightly less than 22 per cent. The&nbsp;second step includes a comparison of the monitor&nbsp;corpus and collections held at the Library of&nbsp;Congress and the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library at</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ohio State University. By checking authors in these</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">collections against a </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">list of names</span><span class="font6"> that were assigned genders by the US Social Security Administration, we&nbsp;compare their gender make-ups and will potentially&nbsp;add to our corpus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Gender and Interaction Types in SemiAutomatic Networks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Network analysis has steadily grown as an area of research since Franco Moretti's visualization of&nbsp;Shakespeare's </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span><span class="font6"> (Moretti). Scholars have&nbsp;focused on automatic extraction and statistical&nbsp;analysis of data from novels, plays, and intellectual&nbsp;networks (Elson, Dames &amp; McKeown; van de Camp &amp;&nbsp;van den Bosch). Recent efforts include computing&nbsp;main characters and operationalizing dynamic&nbsp;networks (Jannidis et al; Karsdorp &amp; van den Bosch;&nbsp;Xanthos et al). While these networks answer some of&nbsp;Drucker's criticism, the approaches remain&nbsp;reductive. Limiting interactions to undifferentiated&nbsp;edges appears particularly unsatisfying for visual&nbsp;media, in which communication takes visibly&nbsp;different forms: characters may look at and touch&nbsp;each other, or appear together in a panel. Despite&nbsp;recent advances, computer vision has trouble&nbsp;recognizing non-perspectival drawings and applying&nbsp;OCR to handwritten comics fonts remains fraught&nbsp;with difficulty (Dunst et al; Rigaud 2013 &amp; 2015). As&nbsp;the automatic extraction of network data is some&nbsp;way off for comics, we focus on networks that are&nbsp;semantically enriched via manual annotation to&nbsp;engage with the central questions posed by cultural&nbsp;studies. The following network (Figure 3) of Karasik&nbsp;and Mazzuchelli's </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">City of Glass</span><span class="font6"> combines different&nbsp;types of interaction with gender assignations:</span></p><img src="047_files/047-3.jpg" style="width:229pt;height:201pt;"/>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Figure 3: Interactions and gender assignations in City of Glass</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These networks and the SSA name database allow us to study the relation between authors'&nbsp;gender and its fictional representation. Male&nbsp;characters are consistently more central to works by&nbsp;male authors. Notably, female characters show&nbsp;higher betweenness centrality in narratives written&nbsp;by women, as Figure 4 shows.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Semi-Automated Bechdel-Test for GNML-Annotated Graphic Narratives</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Efforts to automate the Bechdel Test have been limited to plays and film scripts and led to poor&nbsp;results (Lawrence; Agarwal et al). Three conditions&nbsp;need to be met to pass the test: 1. At least two female&nbsp;characters appear in the story. 2. There is at least one&nbsp;conversation between women. 3. The conversation is&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">about a man. Our XML-annotation language&nbsp;GNML, an extension of John Walsh's CBML, allows for&nbsp;automatically checking if graphic narratives fail</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><img src="047_files/047-4.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:170pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">female</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 4: Centralities of character's genders by author's gender</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">criteria 1 and 2, and aids evaluation of whether the remaining narratives pass criteria 3. We decided not&nbsp;to rely on error-prone full automation but to use&nbsp;semi-automatic processes that aid human&nbsp;annotators/analyzers in retrieving quality results.&nbsp;GNML annotations contain information on all&nbsp;character occurrences, the gender of a character, and&nbsp;their interactions. As discussed by Agarwal, even&nbsp;sophisticated machine learning approaches lead to&nbsp;unreliable results in deciding whether a&nbsp;conversation centers on a man. Therefore, for&nbsp;criteria 3, we simplify decision-making by providing&nbsp;the annotator with a ranked list of dialogues, based&nbsp;on the number of male names or male personal&nbsp;pronouns per conversation. Significantly, even if a&nbsp;conversation's focus on a male character could be&nbsp;identified automatically, the test would still be error-prone. Conversations may span several panels or&nbsp;pages and automatic separation of these&nbsp;conversations remains difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions and Future Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We present corpus metadata and semantically-enriched networks of a widely popular but understudied medium that is only beginning to&nbsp;attract attention by DH researchers. These methods&nbsp;are used to analyze gender and racial biases and&nbsp;suggest ways in which DH can appeal to scholars in&nbsp;cultural studies and the wider public. Future work&nbsp;includes expanding pilot studies to cover our entire&nbsp;corpus by integrating advances in OCR and computer&nbsp;vision and thus working towards fully-automatic&nbsp;extraction and analysis. In the meantime, our&nbsp;networks may function as conceptual models&nbsp;exploring how humanistic forms of complexity can&nbsp;be introduced into network analysis. Analyzing and&nbsp;addressing racial biases against minority authors&nbsp;presents hurdles of a different sort. A repeat of our&nbsp;survey for minority authors appears unproblematic&nbsp;but assigning racial identity to names or authors&nbsp;could be viewed as unethical and, given the&nbsp;international nature of our corpus, would have to&nbsp;consider the complex relationship of racial, national,&nbsp;and regional identities.</span></p>
