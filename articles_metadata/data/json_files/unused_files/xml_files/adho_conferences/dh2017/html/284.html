<p><span class="font3">How can DH regional communities best be cultivated and sustained? This panel explores US-based digital humanities collectives that foster active&nbsp;communities of practice. Regional consortia are a&nbsp;growing phenomenon in US digital humanities,&nbsp;offering opportunities for loosely organized groups of&nbsp;DHers to share workshops, events, datasets,&nbsp;conferences, and news with one another. Such&nbsp;arrangements have the benefits of addressing&nbsp;institutional barriers to DH work and enabling sharing&nbsp;that can help address, at least in a small way, funding&nbsp;and infrastructural inequities that can make it hard for&nbsp;newcomers to begin DH work. According to John&nbsp;Theibault, regional consortia “can be distinguished&nbsp;from, on the one hand, state and national digital&nbsp;humanities groups that organize conferences and edit&nbsp;journals and require paid membership, as well as&nbsp;digital humanities centers located in a single&nbsp;institution or formally constituted groups with explicit&nbsp;criteria for admission, and, on the other hand, not&nbsp;visibly organized interactions in active digital&nbsp;humanities regions, even if those interactions are&nbsp;frequent in practice” (2016). Theibault identified 11&nbsp;self-organized regional consortia not affiliated with a&nbsp;larger organization such as EADH, mostly in the US.&nbsp;Such consortia can serve an important need in&nbsp;connecting researchers from a range of institutions&nbsp;and building community more expansive than a&nbsp;campus and more localized than a national or&nbsp;international scholarly organization. As Rebecca Frost&nbsp;Davis and Bryan Alexander have pointed out, “largescale multi-institutional projects aimed at building&nbsp;resources and pooling expertise . . . [can be]&nbsp;constructed to match the needs of both small liberal&nbsp;arts colleges and large research institutions.” The&nbsp;building out of regional consortia, then, can help&nbsp;broaden the impact and audience for digital&nbsp;humanities work while simultaneously addressing&nbsp;infrastructural needs and allowing institutions to&nbsp;share complementary strengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This panel will consider how a range of regional DH groups have organized their communities, many of&nbsp;them through the free WordPress-based platform&nbsp;Commons In A Box, to build active and lasting&nbsp;communities of DH practice. Presentations will cover&nbsp;the contours and plans of specific regional&nbsp;communities as well as the guidance such examples&nbsp;may offer to academic communities just beginning to&nbsp;organize themselves. Attention will be paid to shared&nbsp;commonalities across regional organizations as well&nbsp;as distinctive areas of focus. Included in the panel will&nbsp;be a discussion of software tools that communities can&nbsp;use to build regional DH organizations, with a&nbsp;particular focus on the Commons In A Box software&nbsp;used by many of the groups represented on the panel.&nbsp;The panel will also delve into the challenges of&nbsp;organizing and sustaining a regional consortium,&nbsp;including rewarding the volunteer labor that such&nbsp;organizations depend upon, raising awareness of the&nbsp;consortium, and developing an appropriate&nbsp;governance model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though this panel focuses on US-based regional organizations, it is hoped that the panel will stir&nbsp;conversations on an international level about shared&nbsp;models of community sustenance and infrastructure.&nbsp;Out of this exchange, the panel hopes to build an&nbsp;informal network of regional DH consortia that can&nbsp;serve as the basis for the ongoing development of DH&nbsp;communities.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CBOX Development and NYCDH</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1">Matthew K. Gold</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">This presentation will discuss the design, implementation, and future plans for Commons In A&nbsp;Box (CBOX), with a particular focus on how it is being&nbsp;used in the NYCDH community to foster community&nbsp;among New York City DH researchers and&nbsp;practitioners. In NYCDH, a CBOX site has been used to&nbsp;create groups around discrete topics such as “Digital&nbsp;Art History,” “Librarians In DH,” and the “Digital&nbsp;Antiquity Working Group.” Each of these groups were&nbsp;started by members of the site and are used, along&nbsp;with larger public groups such as “Announcements,” to&nbsp;foster connections across a range of NYC institutions.&nbsp;In recent years, the site has facilitated the planning&nbsp;and implementation of an annual conference that&nbsp;includes a week of workshops on DH subjects offered&nbsp;across the NYC area by a range of institutions, and an&nbsp;annual prize for the best graduate student DH project.&nbsp;The site includes a shared calendar that is populated&nbsp;by members and member institutions, so that it&nbsp;provides a quick sense of DH events in the region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Commons In A Box is a free software project supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan&nbsp;Foundation and maintained by the Graduate Center of&nbsp;the City University of New York. Commons In A Box&nbsp;has two elements: a plugin manager and a default&nbsp;theme. The plugin manager enforces version&nbsp;dependencies between a collection of WordPress&nbsp;plugins, ensuring that all such plugins work&nbsp;seamlessly and without conflict—a technical&nbsp;innovation for the WordPress plugin ecosystem. For&nbsp;the end-user, the experience of installing Commons In&nbsp;A Box is extremely smooth; upon activating CBOX, the&nbsp;plugin manager automatically performs what would&nbsp;otherwise be dozens of manual steps, including plugin&nbsp;installation, activation, and configuration. The CBOX&nbsp;theme, which is based on the design of the CUNY&nbsp;Academic Commons, can also be installed; when&nbsp;activated, it creates a Commons space that features&nbsp;image sliders, community elements such as lists of&nbsp;members and recently updated blogs in the sidebar,&nbsp;and group-related functionality such as “reply-byemail” group forum functionality that has been crucial&nbsp;to community building on the CUNY Academic&nbsp;Commons. The result, and the key technical innovation&nbsp;of the CBOX project, is the transformation of a&nbsp;complicated set-up and customization procedure into&nbsp;an easy, streamlined installation process. CBOX is&nbsp;currently used by a number of organizations, including&nbsp;the Modern Language Association, NYCDH, Texas DH,&nbsp;Virginia DH, and Florida DH, to build Commons spaces&nbsp;for DH communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under the aegis of an NEH Implementation Grant, Commons In A Box - OpenLab is a new version of CBOX&nbsp;dedicated specifically to teaching and learning, called&nbsp;CBOX-OL. In this presentation, we will describe how&nbsp;integrating a suite of teaching-centered digital tools&nbsp;for content sharing and annotation into the core code&nbsp;of CBOX and bundling it with a core set of DH&nbsp;pedagogical tools ensuring that CBOX-OL communities&nbsp;meet accessibility standards. We will also partner with&nbsp;OER initiatives at partner institutions to create ways&nbsp;of sharing open-access humanities content within and&nbsp;across Commons environments that promote and&nbsp;reinforce sound citation practices. Finally, we have&nbsp;secured a commitment from Reclaim Hosting, a&nbsp;popular hosting service for educational institutions&nbsp;and digital humanities projects, to integrate CBOX-OL&nbsp;into its suite of easily installable software packages.&nbsp;Included in the new version of CBOX will be a set of&nbsp;teaching-related plugins as well as a suite of DH-related WordPress tools in the areas of scholarly&nbsp;communication, such as Braille, which translates&nbsp;English text into Braille; Anthologize, which enables&nbsp;bloggers to create eBooks from their posts; DiRT&nbsp;Tools, which helps community members identify the&nbsp;tools from the DiRT Directory they use; and&nbsp;PressForward, which can be used by teachers to&nbsp;collect content, and then to assign the selection,&nbsp;evaluation, and re-publication of that content with an&nbsp;introduction as an activity to encourage students to&nbsp;connect their classroom discussion with ongoing&nbsp;contemporary debates. All of these plugins will benefit&nbsp;the digital humanities humanities via their potential to&nbsp;enable open learning and exchange, emphasizing&nbsp;scholarship as an open, process-based activity, rather&nbsp;than a closed, solitary one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Commons spaces don’t build themselves; rather, they are cultivated and energized by participation and&nbsp;leadership from members. Technical development&nbsp;lays the foundation on which such work can happen,&nbsp;but the growth, evolution, and sustainability of such&nbsp;platforms require vision, commitment, and&nbsp;resourcefulness from members of the communities&nbsp;where they launch. This presentation will close with a&nbsp;consideration of the ongoing personal, institutional,&nbsp;individual, consortial, and infrastructural support&nbsp;needed to foster and maintain flourishing&nbsp;communities of active practitioners.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The CUNY Academic Commons</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1">Micki Kaufman and Lisa Rhody</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The CUNY Academic Commons is an academic network built at the City University of New York&nbsp;(CUNY) by and for faculty, graduate students,&nbsp;administrators, staff, postdocs, and alumni across the&nbsp;24-campus system. The site serves to foster&nbsp;community and promote scholarship across our&nbsp;twenty-four campuses. With over 7,293 members and&nbsp;well into its seventh year, the Commons continues to&nbsp;evolve as a vibrant space where members connect,&nbsp;create, collaborate, and explore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the site has grown and matured, user outreach has become an increasing focus. In addition to&nbsp;webinars and one-to-one engagement with users and&nbsp;administrators of Commons groups, the team has most&nbsp;recently established Commons Faculty Fellowships to&nbsp;assist faculty in setting up Commons sites and&nbsp;customizing the platform to provide the right teaching&nbsp;tool for class needs. In conjunction with CUNY campus&nbsp;Teaching and Learning Centers, these outreach efforts&nbsp;are helping to promote the benefits of the Commons as&nbsp;a teaching tool across the 24 campuses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A significant focus of the Commons development has been on personalization of the user experience.&nbsp;With the addition of attractive, customizable public&nbsp;profiles, members can now create beautiful online&nbsp;portfolios for their work. The high-impact header&nbsp;section provides an elegant profile synopsis and&nbsp;collapses as one scrolls down the page. Social media&nbsp;icons and website links help connect user profiles to a&nbsp;range of services on the web. Our sophisticated profile&nbsp;builder makes it easy to create an online CV using freeform and specialized widgets designed to highlight&nbsp;positions, education, publications, and interests, and&nbsp;the new RSS feed widget helps members include&nbsp;excerpts of recent posts. Likewise, the addition of&nbsp;Quick Links gives user profiles, blogs and groups&nbsp;customizable shortened links, easy to remember and&nbsp;ideal for business cards and CVs. Using the cuny.is/&nbsp;URL shortener helps Commons users to personalize&nbsp;their site and to more effectively communicate their&nbsp;relationship to CUNY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Commons allows users to create and join as many groups and websites as they want. This allows&nbsp;users to administrate departments, teach classes,&nbsp;discuss and share resources on a selected topic, and&nbsp;connect with people sharing common interests on the&nbsp;Commons. Features of the Commons include the&nbsp;ability to have groups be public, private, or hidden and&nbsp;can include a host of functions including discussion&nbsp;forums, file storage and document collaboration, and&nbsp;rich email integration that allows a more email-driven,&nbsp;‘listserv-like’ interaction with the Commons. Sites&nbsp;created by Commons users take many forms including&nbsp;personal blogs, research projects, department, class,&nbsp;event or conference sites, journals, reviews and news&nbsp;commentaries, and photo blogs, and are configurable&nbsp;using hundreds of themes and plugins for a wide range&nbsp;of visual presentations. Users also have free access to&nbsp;the Commons community’s WordPress Help group to&nbsp;get help building their sites and managing&nbsp;accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Commons also now includes Social Paper, a networked writing environment that enables students&nbsp;to compose and share all forms of their written work&nbsp;across classes, disciplines, semesters, and publics.&nbsp;Likewise, students can browse and comment on the&nbsp;papers of their peers. Unlike many learning&nbsp;management systems or course blogs, Social Paper&nbsp;gives students full control over the sharing settings of&nbsp;each individual piece of writing. Students may choose&nbsp;to share a paper with a professor, a class, a writing&nbsp;group, the public at large, or alternately, keep it private&nbsp;as part of their personal, in-progress, reflective&nbsp;writing portfolio. Additionally, while composing,&nbsp;students can post comments on their writing with&nbsp;questions mentioning other users in order to solicit&nbsp;peer feedback or interest. By giving students a&nbsp;centralized space to manage the totality of their&nbsp;writing, students can easily change privacy settings as&nbsp;they mature as writers and thinkers, develop&nbsp;audiences for their growing body of work, and&nbsp;reflectively build off prior writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the Commons continues to grow, and as its development team continues to release updated&nbsp;versions of Commons In A Box, the site will endeavor&nbsp;to continue serving the needs of faculty, students,&nbsp;administrators and alumni across the 24 CUNY&nbsp;campuses -- and in the process exemplifying how an&nbsp;academic social network can be sustained across a&nbsp;university system with multiple campuses.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Texas Digital Humanities Consortium</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1">Lisa Spiro</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Even as digital humanists at Texas colleges and universities are creating significant digital humanities&nbsp;projects, we face common challenges, such as finding&nbsp;collaborators, learning new skills and developing&nbsp;educational programs. In the fall of 2013, Lisa Spiro&nbsp;(Rice), Cameron Buckner (University of Houston), and&nbsp;Laura Mandell (Texas A&amp;M) discussed establishing a&nbsp;statewide digital humanities consortium to connect&nbsp;digital humanists across the state and foster&nbsp;collaborations. The University of Houston hosted the&nbsp;first Texas Digital Humanities Consortium (TxDHC)&nbsp;conference, co-sponsored by Rice and Texas A&amp;M, in&nbsp;April of 2014. At the conference, we held an open&nbsp;business meeting to plan the TxDHC, which attracted&nbsp;19 participants from colleges and universities across&nbsp;the state. We discussed common needs, including to&nbsp;support faculty, graduate, and undergraduate training&nbsp;in DH; to build community so that members are aware&nbsp;of projects, opportunities and potential collaborators&nbsp;across the state; and to gain access to infrastructure&nbsp;(such as Omeka) for projects (Spiro 2014). To meet&nbsp;these needs, we planned to develop a website, hold an&nbsp;annual peer-reviewed conference, and provide&nbsp;informal opportunities to interact, such as by&nbsp;publicizing visiting speakers at our home institutions.&nbsp;We also explored creating internship opportunities for&nbsp;graduate students and advocating for DH. Rather than&nbsp;establishing formal structures, we decided to operate&nbsp;as a “coalition of the willing,” with decision-making by&nbsp;consensus. To gather additional input, TxDHC used an&nbsp;online survey, which had 14 respondents between&nbsp;April and September of 2014. Respondents ranked the&nbsp;following as the leading “high” priorities: foster&nbsp;networking (92.9%); identify researchers in Texas&nbsp;with common interests (71.4%); and facilitate&nbsp;collaborative research (64.3%).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Informed by the input received from the meeting and survey, Spiro set up a founding steering&nbsp;committee (SC) for TxDHC, inviting representatives&nbsp;from Texas universities and colleges to serve. Current&nbsp;SC members include Spiro (chair), Jennifer Hecker&nbsp;(University of Texas), Laura Mandell, Rafia Mirza (UT-Arlington), Laurel Stvan (UT-Arlington), Toniesha&nbsp;Taylor (Prairie View A&amp;M), Andrew Torget&nbsp;(University of North Texas), and Dillon Wackerman&nbsp;(SMU); representatives from Southwestern University&nbsp;and University of Houston have also served on the&nbsp;committee.The Steering Committee meets via video&nbsp;conferencing several times each year to discuss the&nbsp;ongoing development of consortium and events such&nbsp;as conferences and webinars; we also communicate&nbsp;fairly regularly through email. Our mission is to “&nbsp;promote digital research in the humanities disciplines&nbsp;and facilitate interaction amongst researchers&nbsp;working in the digital humanities both within the&nbsp;state, nationally, and internationally” by connecting&nbsp;people, facilitating training and knowledge sharing,&nbsp;and raising the visibility of DH work. Membership in&nbsp;TxDHC is open to anyone who sets up a profile on the&nbsp;organization’s website. Currently there are 58 “active”&nbsp;members and 116 members signed up for&nbsp;announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This presentation will explore TxDHC’s history, initiatives, challenges and future plans. TxDHC’s core&nbsp;activities focus on building community across the&nbsp;state, including through:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our website. </span><span class="font3">Texas A&amp;M’s Initiative for Digital&nbsp;Humanities, Media, and Culture (thanks&nbsp;particularly to the work of former staff member&nbsp;Matthew Christy) installed and hosts the&nbsp;TxDHC’s website ( <a href="http://www.txdhc.org/">http://www.txdhc.org/</a> ),&nbsp;using Commons in a Box to encourage&nbsp;collaboration. The website includes member&nbsp;profiles, groups focused on topics such as&nbsp;Training and Metadata Standards, and a&nbsp;calendar. We have also implemented the DiRT&nbsp;Tools plugin to identify tools used by TxDHC&nbsp;members ( <a href="http://www.txdhc.org/tool/">http://www.txdhc.org/tool/</a> ).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">State-wide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conferences. </span><span class="font3">TxDHC has</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sponsored two multi-day conferences: its inaugural conference at the University of&nbsp;Houston in 2014 and its second conference at&nbsp;UT Arlington in 2015. While these conferences&nbsp;boasted strong programs, recruiting Texas&nbsp;institutions to host the event has proven&nbsp;challenging, especially since TxDHC lacks&nbsp;resources beyond endorsing the conference,&nbsp;publicizing it, and enlisting steering committee&nbsp;members to assist with it. In 2016, TxDHC&nbsp;shifted to a strategy of partnering with other&nbsp;Texas digital humanities/ digital library&nbsp;conferences to hold post-conference events,&nbsp;avoiding duplication of efforts, making it more&nbsp;convenient for people to attend both events, and&nbsp;taking advantage of cross-publicity. Recently we&nbsp;organized&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one-day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hybrid</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">unconference/mini-conference following the Texas Conference on Digital Libraries in Austin&nbsp;and a THATCamp following Digital Frontiers in&nbsp;Houston. The mini-conference combined the&nbsp;best of THATCamps and more formal&nbsp;conferences by giving speakers fifteen to twenty&nbsp;minutes to set the context, then devoting the&nbsp;rest of the hour to discussion. While attendance&nbsp;at THATCamp Digital Frontiers was fairly small,&nbsp;the event connected participants from Rice, the&nbsp;University of Houston, UT Arlington, UT Austin,&nbsp;and local museums and explored topics such as&nbsp;creating an introduction to DH course and&nbsp;reviving DH projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Webinars: </span><span class="font3">TxDHC runs occasional web-based&nbsp;workshops on topics such as OpenRefine, DPLA,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and using tools like Omeka or Hypothes.is in the classroom. To encourage interaction and build&nbsp;community, we employ a video conferencing&nbsp;platform so that participants can see each&nbsp;other’s faces, and we try to set aside time at the&nbsp;end of each event for information sharing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TxDHC faces several challenges:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Raising awareness of its existence. </span><span class="font3">At the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">recent Digital Frontiers conference, it became clear that many attendees didn’t know about&nbsp;TxDHC. The organization is primarily publicized&nbsp;through its events, website, word of mouth, and&nbsp;Twitter, but more outreach to DH groups across&nbsp;the state is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Accomplishing its vision with few resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lacking a budget or staff, TxDHC depends on the time and commitment of its hard-working&nbsp;volunteers, particularly its steering committee&nbsp;members. Of course, these volunteers face&nbsp;competing demands on their time, so&nbsp;consortium work is fit in as it can be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping the website updated and&nbsp;encouraging people to make full use of it.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Ideally, members of TxDHC would add events to&nbsp;the calendar and participate more actively in&nbsp;online groups, but those hopes haven’t yet&nbsp;materialized. Focused outreach may increase&nbsp;participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Developing a governance model</span><span class="font3">. Initially we&nbsp;operated without clearly defined roles, which&nbsp;allowed for flexibility but also meant that&nbsp;members didn’t necessarily get recognized for&nbsp;their contributions and weren’t tied to&nbsp;particular responsibilities. Moreover, we would&nbsp;like to develop a more coherent and transparent&nbsp;method for bringing new members onto the&nbsp;steering committee and rolling senior members&nbsp;off. In December of 2015, members of the&nbsp;steering committee came together for a daylong retreat at Rice University, where we&nbsp;discussed the need to spread out the work and&nbsp;ensure that all are recognized for their&nbsp;contributions and sketched out more defined&nbsp;roles. We are working on bylaws to formalize&nbsp;the organization’s operations and are in the&nbsp;process of implementing plans made at the&nbsp;retreat. At the same time, many SC members are&nbsp;sympathetic to the lightweight organizational&nbsp;approach taken by NYCDH, which several&nbsp;Steering Committee members learned about&nbsp;during a recent presentation by Alex Gil and&nbsp;Kimon Keramidas at Digital Frontiers 2016.&nbsp;Focusing on partnerships and fostering&nbsp;communication across Texas DH organizations&nbsp;seems like a sound strategy for a small, allvolunteer organization like TxDHC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Dealing with geographical distance: </span><span class="font3">Since Texas is the second largest state in the US, it can&nbsp;be difficult to connect people across such a&nbsp;significant distance. To cope with this distance,&nbsp;we have organized state-wide events and online&nbsp;gatherings, but we also hope to encourage&nbsp;members to use the website to promote events&nbsp;and activities within a particular city or region&nbsp;within Texas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By working together, regional consortia can learn from each other, explore developing common&nbsp;infrastructure (as we have already benefited from&nbsp;CUNY’s work on Commons in a Box), and facilitate&nbsp;broader collaborations around research and teaching.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Florida Digital Humanities Consortium</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1">Scot French</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">My presentation will explore the opportunities and challenges involved in creating a geographically&nbsp;extended, self-governing regional consortium&nbsp;(FLDH/Florida Digital Humanities Consortium) that&nbsp;depends, for its intellectual labor and technology&nbsp;support infrastructure, on academic institutional&nbsp;sponsorship while promoting free, open access to&nbsp;academic networks and DH resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Founded at THATCamp Florida 2014, FLDH’s mission “is to provide a platform for studying and&nbsp;discussing digital tools, methods, and pedagogies as&nbsp;well as for educating teachers, faculty, and the public&nbsp;about the multiple, interdisciplinary ways humanities&nbsp;research and computing impact our world. It meets&nbsp;annually to identify issues of interest and to set goals&nbsp;for future collaboration and digital humanities&nbsp;research.” At present the group has 12 institutional&nbsp;members, ranging from large research institutions to&nbsp;small liberal arts colleges: University of Florida&nbsp;(Gainesville), University of Central Florida (Orlando),&nbsp;Florida State University (Tallahassee), University of&nbsp;South Florida (Tampa), University of Miami, Florida&nbsp;International University (Miami), Rollins College&nbsp;(Winter Park), New College of Florida (Sarasota),&nbsp;Florida Southern College (Lakeland), Eckerd College&nbsp;(St. Petersburg), and the Florida Humanities Council.&nbsp;Inspired by NYCDH and the CUNY Academic&nbsp;Commons, group organizers adopted the Commons In&nbsp;a Box (CBOX) academic commons social networking&nbsp;platform as a virtual space in which to foster&nbsp;community and share resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An internal grant from the University of Central Florida funded an organizational meeting in Orlando&nbsp;at which representatives of participating schools and&nbsp;the Florida Humanities Council established an&nbsp;Executive Council with two representatives from each&nbsp;institution. A five-member elected Steering Committee&nbsp;drafted a mission statement and set of by-laws,&nbsp;established short- and long-term goals, and began&nbsp;planning for two major initiatives: Hosting HASTAC17&nbsp;in Orlando (scheduled for November 2017) and&nbsp;submitting a proposal to host a southeast regional preconference workshop on visualization tools through&nbsp;the National Endowment for the Humanities’&nbsp;Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Humanities.&nbsp;Working on these initiatives has placed new demands&nbsp;on FLDH’s leadership structure, and prompted a shift&nbsp;from volunteer initiative to a more active chair and&nbsp;working group/subcommittee organizational&nbsp;framework.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To date, all of our discussions about how best to build and organize our statewide/regional consortium&nbsp;have been internal to the group. We seek to expand the&nbsp;conversation to representatives of similar groups,&nbsp;particularly those using the CBOX platform developed&nbsp;by Matthew K. Gold and his project team at CUNY. Out&nbsp;of this exchange we hope to build an informal network&nbsp;of regional DH consortia for purposes of information&nbsp;sharing that can be expanded and formalized as&nbsp;needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper/presentation will raise issues of general interest to the DH community and of&nbsp;particular concern to members of the FLDH Executive&nbsp;Council (which I chair) and Steering Committee (on&nbsp;which I serve as a founding member).</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Leadership/Self-Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structures</span><span class="font3">.</span></h4>

<p><span class="font3">As chair of the FLDH Executive Council and a member of the Steering Committee I will conduct an informal&nbsp;member survey to solicit other potential topics for&nbsp;discussion during this session. Ideas generated by this&nbsp;panel will be shared with the Executive Council and&nbsp;serve as the basis for discussion and action at an FLDH&nbsp;organizational meeting during the Orlando HASTAC&nbsp;conference in November 2017.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SD|DH: Building and Strengthening DH Teaching and Learning through a Regional&nbsp;Network</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font1">Erin Glass and Jessica Pressman</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">How can DH regional networks work to spread resources to underserved student populations, foster&nbsp;digital literacy and confidence in educators without&nbsp;DH institutional support, and strengthen local,&nbsp;humanistic forms of social advocacy? This&nbsp;presentation will focus on the development and future&nbsp;plans of the San Diego Digital Humanities (SD|DH)&nbsp;regional network, a collective comprised of faculty&nbsp;(and some staff and graduate students) from seven&nbsp;different local higher education institutions ranging&nbsp;from a R1 university to community colleges. While San&nbsp;Diego is not prominently known for humanities&nbsp;research—let alone DH—we recognize that its&nbsp;location on the border of Mexico, and the diverse&nbsp;student body of its institutions, make it an&nbsp;exceptionally rich site for socially-engaged,&nbsp;participatory forms of DH activity. By pooling&nbsp;resources, expertise, experience, perspectives, and&nbsp;moral support, SD|DH embraces the power of diversity&nbsp;as our chief value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SD|DH has been working together for the last three years to share experiences and resources, plan events,&nbsp;apply for funding, and seek collegial support for our&nbsp;endeavors. We work from different institutional&nbsp;situations and relationships to digital humanities: a&nbsp;campus pursuing a grass-roots and ground-up&nbsp;approach to digital humanities research and teaching&nbsp;but lacking funding for institutional infrastructure, a&nbsp;campus administration wanting to implement digital&nbsp;humanities from a top-down structure, and a campus&nbsp;successfully implementing digital humanities projects&nbsp;within a specific department but lacking the&nbsp;leadership to build out from there. We have been&nbsp;successful in different ways at different campuses, but&nbsp;we now have a full-blown DH initiative at SDSU and an&nbsp;emerging program at USD, and we continue to use our&nbsp;individual campus efforts to bolster the region</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our first goal in forming SD|DH was to assess the barriers to implementing DH across a wide spectrum&nbsp;of institutions and diverse student populations, and&nbsp;develop work-around strategies for implementing DH&nbsp;by drawing upon the resources of multiple institutions&nbsp;within a single region. From the start, these efforts&nbsp;have been voluntary, but we were able to expand our&nbsp;efforts and visibility with the generous support of a&nbsp;National Endowment for the Humanities Level I Digital&nbsp;Start Up Grant for our project “Building and&nbsp;Strengthening Digital Humanities through a Regional&nbsp;Network.” This grant supported a series of workshops&nbsp;that focused on distributing DH to institutions and&nbsp;student populations usually left out of DH. It also&nbsp;helped encourage educators to explore new DH&nbsp;techniques for teaching within the safety net of a&nbsp;supportive community. Educators engaged in a wide&nbsp;range of DH methods such as text analysis and game&nbsp;design as well as DH-inspired techniques to creative&nbsp;re-imagine uses of everyday software and tools for&nbsp;pedagogical purposes. We met several times&nbsp;throughout the year to discuss challenges and&nbsp;successes, share expertise, and brainstorm new&nbsp;possible projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this presentation, we will discuss our methods for developing and facilitating these workshops and&nbsp;pedagogical engagements as well as some of the&nbsp;relevant issues concerning coordination, labor,&nbsp;administrative support, technical resources, and&nbsp;transportation. We will also share lessons learned&nbsp;throughout our experience thus far and suggest&nbsp;protocols that could potentially be re-used and repurposed by other institutions. Finally, we will argue&nbsp;for the need to collectively and creatively&nbsp;communicate the value of multi-institutional&nbsp;collaboration to administrators in order to increase&nbsp;administrators’ receptivity to these efforts going&nbsp;forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to discussing projects already carried out, we would like to share our plans for moving&nbsp;forward. As part of deepening and expanding our&nbsp;community’s ties, SD|DH is working towards&nbsp;launching a multi-institutional digital commons&nbsp;powered by Commons in a Box (CBOX) hosted at&nbsp;UCSD. While some SD|DH campuses could ostensibly&nbsp;run and host their own CBOX we have decided to&nbsp;experiment with creating a single commons for our&nbsp;community so that all participating SD|DH institutions&nbsp;can take advantage of the many affordances of CBOX.&nbsp;We are planning to use this Commons in multiple&nbsp;ways. First, we will use it to facilitate communications&nbsp;for the SD|DH group as a list serv, events calendar,&nbsp;member directory, and showcase of SD|DH projects.&nbsp;However, we will also invite all students, faculty, and&nbsp;staff of SD|DH institutions to use the Commons for&nbsp;networking across institutions, building websites&nbsp;related to research and teaching (for any discipline),&nbsp;and creating interest groups that cut across disciplines&nbsp;and institutions. Finally, we also hope to implement&nbsp;Social Paper, a collaborative writing tool developed at&nbsp;The CUNY Graduate Center for CBOX through the&nbsp;generous support of a NEH Digital Start Up Grant. We&nbsp;are currently discussing the possibility of designing&nbsp;multi-institutional synchronous courses that will&nbsp;engage students in thinking through the role of&nbsp;collaboration in their respective disciplines by&nbsp;collaborating with students outside of their&nbsp;institutions through Social Paper.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
