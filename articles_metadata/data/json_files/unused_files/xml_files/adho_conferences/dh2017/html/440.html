<p><span class="font2">The question of change over time is central for historians as they trace the contours of people,&nbsp;communities, organizations, and states. But&nbsp;computationally tracing changes in discourse over&nbsp;time is not a straightforward process with our current&nbsp;algorithmic tools and methods. While charting topics&nbsp;over time can give a general picture of the prevalence&nbsp;of ideas or discourses at various points, Benjamin&nbsp;Schmidt and others have raised concerns regarding&nbsp;the ways existing tools and methods model change&nbsp;over time. Most text-mining algorithms assume that&nbsp;time is linear and progressive, is experienced as such,&nbsp;and that the data is generally consistent over time. As&nbsp;Schmidt notes, even models such as Topics over Time,&nbsp;which was developed to account for shifts in language,&nbsp;are problematic because of the assumptions they&nbsp;make regarding how language changes (Schmidt 2012,&nbsp;see also Underwood, 2012, and Nowviskie, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we allow that time is relative and that the experience of time shapes the ways a community and&nbsp;its discourses develop, we are faced with the challenge&nbsp;of how to incorporate varied experiences of time into&nbsp;our computational models. This poster will present my&nbsp;preliminary results applying various periodization&nbsp;schemes to track the development of Seventh-day&nbsp;Adventist discourses around salvation and health over&nbsp;the first 70 years of the denomination's existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Seventh-day Adventism is an apocalyptic and millennialist belief system, in that followers anticipate&nbsp;the imminent return of Jesus Christ and the&nbsp;corresponding end of the world. Born out of William&nbsp;Miller’s teaching that 1843 (later 1844) would be the&nbsp;date of Christ’s return, early Seventh-day Adventists&nbsp;reinterpreted the date in the wake of the Great&nbsp;Disappointment (the period after October 22, 1844,&nbsp;the date the Millerites believed Jesus would return. to&nbsp;signify the start of a new, final, and assumedly short&nbsp;phase in the work of salvation). They also adopted&nbsp;Sabbatarianism, holding Saturday, rather than Sunday,&nbsp;as the proper day for Christian observance. As such,&nbsp;early adherents operated within a changing temporal&nbsp;imaginary, organizing their weeks and years in&nbsp;contrast to their religious neighbors and anticipating,&nbsp;with varying degrees of urgency at different points in&nbsp;their history, the second coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The changing constructions of time within Seventh-day Adventism provide an instructive case study for examining how alternative structures and experiences&nbsp;of time might be modeled computationally. With a&nbsp;corpus of approximately 13,000 periodical issues split&nbsp;into nearly 200,000 pages, I am using Latent Dirichlet&nbsp;Allocation as implemented in Gensim to cluster the&nbsp;pages according to five different periodization&nbsp;schemes: no periodization (the whole corpus,&nbsp;spanning 70 years); periodization by decade (the&nbsp;corpus split by decade increments); cumulative&nbsp;periodization by decade (the corpus split by decade&nbsp;increments, but with each subsequent period added to&nbsp;the previous - i.e., 1844-1850, 1844-1860, 1844-1870,&nbsp;etc.); historical periodization (the corpus split&nbsp;according to “crisis” points in the denomination’s&nbsp;history); cumulative historical periodization (the&nbsp;corpus split according to the historical periodization&nbsp;scheme above but with each subsequent period added&nbsp;to the previous).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Comparing these different schemes will enable me to explore whether and how periodization influences&nbsp;which discursive patterns I am able to surface&nbsp;computationally. To compare between the resulting&nbsp;models, I will evaluate on the following aspects: how&nbsp;well the documents are described by the topic labels&nbsp;assigned; the coherence of the topics, both internally&nbsp;and in relation to each other; and the visibility of&nbsp;change and development of topics over time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My hypothesis is that the cumulative historical periodization will provide the richest picture of the&nbsp;shifts in the community’s discourse. I anticipate that&nbsp;this will be visible through the percentage of&nbsp;documents labelled as relating to different topics, the&nbsp;appearance of new related topics over time, and&nbsp;different topic compositions at different points in time.&nbsp;However, I may conclude that the different&nbsp;periodization schemes provide little additional&nbsp;information. I propose that a negative conclusion is&nbsp;also important for the field and either result will&nbsp;provide productive information for developing&nbsp;computational methods that address the complexities&nbsp;that are at the heart of the humanities.</span></p>
