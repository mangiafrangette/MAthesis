<p><span class="font3">The modeling of mass quantities of cultural objects has led the humanities in new and sometimes&nbsp;discomforting directions. Digital humanists have come&nbsp;to realize the stakes of such practices: emerging paths&nbsp;of scholarship that supplement but may also&nbsp;fundamentally alter the research methodologies and&nbsp;outputs of the humanities. Matthew Wilkens writes&nbsp;that the necessary &quot;decay&quot; of critical techniques that&nbsp;pay close attention to those objects is &quot;a negative in&nbsp;itself only if we mistakenly equate literary and cultural&nbsp;analysis with their current working method&quot; (Wilkens,&nbsp;2012). One question that remains is if the quantitative&nbsp;working method of such large analyses is compatible&nbsp;with that &quot;current working method&quot; - in this case, the&nbsp;individual interpretation and critique of texts. In the&nbsp;years since Franco Moretti's &quot;distant reading&quot;&nbsp;paradigm became a commonplace, scholars have&nbsp;tested this useful if problematic dichotomy of &quot;close&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;distant&quot; reading. In 2013, for instance, Andrew&nbsp;Piper writes of the &quot;topology&quot; resultant from the&nbsp;dispersive techniques of programmatic text analysis.&nbsp;Setting the lexical components of texts in relation to&nbsp;one another, Piper envisions a tactic of &quot;focalization&quot;&nbsp;that can allow &quot;readers&quot; of such deconstructed texts to&nbsp;understand the relationships between those&nbsp;components (or characteristics) at multiple scales&nbsp;(Piper, 2013: 375). And yet there is always a&nbsp;&quot;between&quot; those multiple scales: &quot;for every unity there&nbsp;can always be something between it and that which it&nbsp;succeeds&quot; (381). Subsequently, there also exist&nbsp;important relationships between these scales of&nbsp;information that inform one another. When&nbsp;macroanalysis brings us to a point where we must&nbsp;return our close attention to our objects of study, we&nbsp;need be reminded of the model that brought us to that&nbsp;perspective in the first place. In focalizing, we are best&nbsp;served to maintain multiple foci. It is a natural&nbsp;tendency to want to confirm macroanalytic results by&nbsp;reading texts and by paying attention to the details of&nbsp;our mathematical models. But how might we do so&nbsp;while keeping the complex relationships of those&nbsp;models in mind?</span></p><img src="238_files/238-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:152pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. “Topic Words in Context”: an in-browser tool for exploring the scales of data in a topic model</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When digital humanists use topic models to explore large corpora of texts, they do so at an&nbsp;inherent disadvantage. Typically presented with flat&nbsp;files listing topics and topic weights, they are left to&nbsp;interpret these lists and figures separate from the&nbsp;texts that have just been modeled. Several significant&nbsp;tools have been developed to help scholars visually&nbsp;navigate the textual relationships in topic models.&nbsp;However, in the past few years I have been working on&nbsp;a practical, critical methodology for understanding&nbsp;topic models and the relations between their outputs&nbsp;and that &quot;current working method&quot; of the humanities:&nbsp;human-guided close and contextual reading. For this&nbsp;talk, I will take attendees on a visual exploration of a&nbsp;topic model of Emily Dickinson's poetry using a highly&nbsp;interactive and playful data visualization I developed&nbsp;for my Master's thesis, called &quot;Topic Words in Context&quot;&nbsp;- or &quot;TWiC&quot;, for short. TWiC is a multi-paneled&nbsp;environment for web browsers that allows users to&nbsp;explore and juxtapose multiple scales of data in topic&nbsp;models of digital corpora. It uses shapes, colors, and&nbsp;cross-panel highlighting to get users of topic models&nbsp;from &quot;big&quot; data to &quot;small&quot; and back. Importantly, it&nbsp;also provides an alternate &quot;publication&quot; view that&nbsp;resituates modeled texts back into their original&nbsp;publication contexts (e.g. texts split for modeling&nbsp;purposes or texts within a collection). Recalling&nbsp;Piper's topological concepts, TWiC brings our focus&nbsp;simultaneously to these many textual and statistical&nbsp;relationships at play within a topic model. From&nbsp;corpus-wide topic distributions to texts to the topics&nbsp;themselves, each scale of the model when set against&nbsp;each other can reveal hierarchical qualities that enrich&nbsp;and move beyond the semantic/linguistic&nbsp;relationships frequently associated with the word lists&nbsp;of topic models. (Documentation and color&nbsp;screenshots of TWiC are available at in the&nbsp;README.md file at github.com/jarmoza/twic.) Of the&nbsp;many analytical techniques TWiC makes possible, I&nbsp;will demonstrate how we can produce expressive,&nbsp;critical comparisons between our close readings of&nbsp;texts and the smallest of quantitative scales in a topic&nbsp;model: individual texts and individual topics. We will&nbsp;look at different weighting schemes for topic and topic&nbsp;word distributions, how to quantitatively characterize&nbsp;and visualize them, and then how to compare them to&nbsp;traditional literary criticism. As it turns out, the&nbsp;expressiveness of a topic model functions differently&nbsp;depending on the context in which we depict its data.&nbsp;To show this I will turn our attention to the literary-bibliographic focus of my Master's thesis, Emily&nbsp;Dickinson's &quot;fascicle&quot; books of poetry.</span></p><img src="238_files/238-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:124pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2. The topics of several Dickinson poems, displayed proportionately and in the order of a fascicle</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Emily Dickinson died in 1886, leaving behind in a small, wooden box an unpublished trove of poetry&nbsp;numbering near 2,000 individual works. Many of those&nbsp;poems were bound, hand-sewn into tiny books that&nbsp;have come to be known as her &quot;fascicles.&quot; While her&nbsp;poems were being prepared to be published, a family&nbsp;feud arose that split the collection of her manuscripts,&nbsp;and also resulted in the fascicle ordering of her poems&nbsp;being lost for years. A long-studied, now-canonical&nbsp;poet, Dickinson is considered a proto-modernist,&nbsp;someone whose style influenced many of the&nbsp;American poets of the early twentieth century.&nbsp;However, given the size of the task, a comprehensive&nbsp;assessment of every piece of her writing has rarely&nbsp;been attempted. It would not be until the midtwentieth century that the painstaking effort to&nbsp;rediscover those original orderings was made by&nbsp;bibliographers, notably R.W. Franklin. With that work&nbsp;completed, Dickinson scholars like Eleanor Elson</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Heginbotham, Sharon Cameron, and others have provided assessments of a select few of these&nbsp;orderings using all of the critical tools at their disposal&nbsp;honed by years of reading Dickinson: interpretations&nbsp;that pay attention to style, context, biography, history,&nbsp;textual studies, and more. Even so it just may not be&nbsp;humanly possible to provide a comprehensive&nbsp;perspective of her writing via such individual&nbsp;attentiveness. Dickinson's poems and their&nbsp;bibliographic history therefore present a fortuitous&nbsp;and somewhat unique set of circumstances for digital&nbsp;humanists. Her oeuvre as a poet is large enough in size&nbsp;to be mathematically modeled. There is a known&nbsp;ordering to much of her works. And her words are&nbsp;&quot;truth told slant&quot; enough in their polysemy to&nbsp;problematize a topic model's expectations of the&nbsp;relationships between them - even at the level of the&nbsp;individual line, let alone across several works.</span></p><img src="238_files/238-3.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:180pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 3. A Dickinson poem viewed in a composite weighting scheme that utilizes both topic model weights and&nbsp;the considerations of a literary critic</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While digital humanists still want to closely consider our objects of study away from computation,&nbsp;we also want to consider them from these new&nbsp;perspectives that digital modeling methods provide.&nbsp;We tend to bounce between considerations of model-induced order and the contextualizing work done by&nbsp;human-imposed orderings. This talk will provide a&nbsp;case study of how those differing worlds of order&nbsp;relate, how they sometimes either complement or&nbsp;contrast with one another. By combining the outputs&nbsp;of a topic model with the context of Dickinson's&nbsp;fascicle orderings, for instance, one can make quick&nbsp;comparisons between the qualitative discursive&nbsp;relationships of her poems and the quantitative&nbsp;relationships established by a topic model of them. I&nbsp;will introduce TWiC and its publication view to</span></p>
