<p><span class="font3">As a theatrical production, Hamlet poses a particular directorial challenge: the Ghost. How should&nbsp;an apparition be presented onstage alongside mortal&nbsp;characters? Traditional Shakespearean theatre&nbsp;presented apparitions using theatrical effects to&nbsp;visually separate these characters from the mortal&nbsp;characters. Modern theatrical productions must&nbsp;address this same issue with every new staging.&nbsp;Solving this question can help lay a clear conceptual&nbsp;footing for the rest of the production's conceptual&nbsp;considerations. A recent production in New York City&nbsp;in 2015 directed by Austin Pendleton opted to make&nbsp;the Ghost invisible to everyone but those guards who&nbsp;first encounter him, and once Hamlet sees him, only&nbsp;Hamlet. This decision rendered Hamlet mentally&nbsp;disturbed in the eyes of the audience (Isherwood&nbsp;2017). Kenneth Branagh's cinematic Hamlet in 1996&nbsp;created a ghost that had a “special effects and a horrorfilm look.” (Maslin 1996) This approach favors brutal&nbsp;realism expected in modern cinema. These two&nbsp;approaches represent extremes in production&nbsp;solutions to the ghost; psychological illness, and pale&nbsp;faces in armor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Hamlet was first produced, the Elizabethan stage was full of special effects (Brockett, Franklin&nbsp;2008). Shakespeare was a practitioner of special&nbsp;effects technology such as pyrotechnics, rope and&nbsp;pulley and trap doors. His commitment to authenticity&nbsp;and effect even led to the accidental destruction of a&nbsp;theater by fire in 1613 after the use of a cannon-based&nbsp;special effect. As conceived by faculty in a theatre&nbsp;program and a digital effects design department at the&nbsp;same university, the challenge of representing the&nbsp;ghost and the Shakespearean spirit of theatrical effect&nbsp;became an opportunity for collaboration. This was our&nbsp;opportunity to create a new type of ghost, one that&nbsp;bridges the traditions of theater and cutting edge&nbsp;interactive media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theater has a history of stage projections dating from the 1700's use of magic lantern devices (Figure&nbsp;1) to the 1920's when innovators like Erwin Piscator</span></p><img src="274_files/274-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:173pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3">Throughout the twentieth century there was an extraordinary growth in the implementation of&nbsp;projections from experimental to mainstream theater&nbsp;(Theatre Communications Group 2011). While the size&nbsp;and complexity of projections has grown over time&nbsp;they have been until recently static or pre-recorded.&nbsp;With emerging technologies such as Microsoft's Kinect&nbsp;Camera and Derivative Software's TouchDesigner&nbsp;projections can be an interactive, responsive addition&nbsp;to the live theatrical experience. Our collaboration&nbsp;utilized these technologies in creation of our ghost.&nbsp;Theatre has a long tradition of extending the body in&nbsp;performance. Costumes, makeup and prosthetics are&nbsp;the bread-and-butter of the art. Greek theatre used&nbsp;large scale masks and costumes to amplify theatrical&nbsp;expression, while Elizabethan theatre utilized extreme&nbsp;makeup applications and costuming for supernatural&nbsp;characters. Physical puppetry provides a clear&nbsp;mechanism to extend the performative and expressive&nbsp;capabilities of the actor. There are, however, some&nbsp;practical limitations to the physical puppetry&nbsp;approach: the movement and visual effect of the&nbsp;puppet is limited to the physical realities of the&nbsp;performer. Pushing beyond these boundaries, cinema&nbsp;has used digital motion capture to create such&nbsp;characters as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy&nbsp;and the recent Planet of the Apes films. Andy Serkis, an&nbsp;actor known for his motion captured performances,&nbsp;states, “Performance capture is a tool that allows&nbsp;actors to transform themselves into many different&nbsp;characters. You're not confined by physicality. You can&nbsp;play anything” (Hart 2017). Advances in virtual&nbsp;staging and performance capture, notably used in the&nbsp;production of the film Avatar, have extended motion&nbsp;capture for characters into the real time realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although hybrid physical/digital stagings have been undertaken before (Meador, W. Scott, et al 2009,&nbsp;Bermudez et al 2002), the field has not kept pace with&nbsp;rapidly evolving technology. Our production&nbsp;combined recent advances in inexpensive real-time&nbsp;motion capture with the theoretical underpinnings of&nbsp;theatrical puppetry to perform a spatio-digital&nbsp;character in a live theatrical venue. A Kinect sensor on&nbsp;stage captured the movements of a physical actor&nbsp;performing the ghost. This data was manipulated in&nbsp;Derivative Software TouchDesigner and optically&nbsp;projected as an abstract digital apparition back onto&nbsp;the stage concurrent to the performance (Figures 3, 4).&nbsp;The virtual puppet became at once puppet and avatar,&nbsp;both extending and replacing the physical body of the&nbsp;actor. The dual space of this performance, half bodysized space of the actor and half virtualized space of&nbsp;the projected apparition, plays to the notion of the&nbsp;Cybrid space (Anders 1999).</span></p><img src="274_files/274-3.jpg" style="width:212pt;height:190pt;"/>
