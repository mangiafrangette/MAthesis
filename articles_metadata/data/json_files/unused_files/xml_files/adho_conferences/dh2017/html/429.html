<p><span class="font4">Digital humanities teaching programs are today widespread mostly in North American and European&nbsp;universities. However, they are very different in terms&nbsp;of content, focus and audience and as mentioned, they&nbsp;are distributed unevenly around the world, while often linked to diverse academic policies. Some programs are long-term focused, shaped as masters or&nbsp;graduate degrees (with well-known pioneer examples&nbsp;at King's College, Virginia or Pisa, with the so-called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">In-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">formatica Umanistica).</span><span class="font4"> Summer and spring schools</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">have also had great importance in this field, getting researchers into digital humanities as a complementary training and opening new horizons for traditional DH&nbsp;scholars. Names such as Oxford, Victoria and Leipzig&nbsp;deserve a special mention in this area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Networks like </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">DiXiT</span><span class="font4">, and DH infrastructures such as DARIAH and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">CLARIN</span><span class="font4"> are making continuous efforts&nbsp;to centralize, standardize, unify and inform on the different nature, options and advantages of DH training&nbsp;programs. Some examples of these efforts can be appreciated in the deliverables of DARIAH (Sahle 2013),&nbsp;the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">CUNY list of curricula</span><span class="font4">, the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">DARIAH course registry&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">German open-access teaching materials</span><span class="font4">, as well as&nbsp;many other resources available on the web, with special mention to the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">DARIAH Teach</span><span class="font4"> Erasmus plus project, which is now on the spot on the future for DH&nbsp;teaching.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Spanish Case</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">This paper presents the Spanish DH programs developed at LINHD as an innovative case-study from the Spanish-speaking DH community with the aim to illustrate the global teaching panorama. Most of the syllabi&nbsp;of the DH courses at LINHD have been developed under a common collaboration between Spain and Argentina, focused on a broad Spanish-speaking audience and applying e-learning teaching methods. The&nbsp;use of these virtual technologies and methodologies is&nbsp;the success milestone of this initiative, as it constantly&nbsp;reaches students from different backgrounds and profiles and from different parts of the world (Spain but&nbsp;also Latin America and Europe) as long as they are&nbsp;Spanish speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We will first focus on the curricular design of all the programs offered by LINHD, followed by a detailed explanation of the teaching methodology.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Design Of A DH Curriculum</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">LINHD was created in 2014 based on three axes: research, training and dissemination. It launched its first DH summer school: &quot;Introducción a las Humanidades&nbsp;Digitales&quot; in July 2014, getting more than 50 students&nbsp;involved. The summer school was followed by a longer&nbsp;DH program of 30 ECTS credits, lasting from December to September and amplifying all the contents that&nbsp;had been announced in the summer school. The strategy has been similar in the following years, in 2015,&nbsp;summer school was devoted to digital scholarly editing and a new longer winter training program was&nbsp;launched for 2015-2016. This last year, we decided to&nbsp;focus on DH methodologies applied to a specific field,&nbsp;poetry, which had as a result a high-quality summer&nbsp;school on this topic that is at the heart of LINHD projects and research interests. Taking into account the&nbsp;interests of the community, the needs of the field and&nbsp;the offers of new programs in different places, our new&nbsp;proposal for this year, starting in January 2017 is Semantic web technologies and language resources, introducing NLP possibilities for humanities, useful&nbsp;tools, and stylometry, Semantic web technologies will&nbsp;be the second focus of this summer school, supported&nbsp;and cofinanced by CLARIN as a CLARIN user involvement event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our strategy for designing curricula for all these programs has been twofold: first, we have always used&nbsp;as a model the reference curricula for DH mentioned&nbsp;above, along with the needs of the scholars in our own&nbsp;environment. There have been three keys for success:&nbsp;having a DH compliant interdisciplinary teaching faculty, variety in content (our first DH course covered a&nbsp;huge range of topics going from databases, TEI&nbsp;markup, semantic web, visualization to digital libraries), and flexibility to change, thanks to the lessons&nbsp;learned every year.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Distant Teaching Methodology</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">LINHD is based at UNED, the biggest Spanish university, founded more than 40 years ago, which uses semi-present and virtual teaching methods as its&nbsp;unique strategy. This has been a cornerstone for developing our DH teaching programs, as we have used&nbsp;UNED infrastructures as a key part of our teaching&nbsp;methodology. For summer schools, we use a double&nbsp;teaching model: there are keynote lessons with students in the room, but sessions are also recorded and&nbsp;broadcasted in streaming and can be viewed later. Students may choose to attend the school in either of&nbsp;these two ways and receive the same certification.&nbsp;Both options are combined with a virtual teaching&nbsp;platform (called aLF, designed by UNED) where professors upload slides and teaching materials and students interact with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The longer winter courses are only offered online using the aLF virtual platform as the main communication channel among students and faculty members,&nbsp;but the platform includes videos, exercises and virtual&nbsp;research environments as teaching materials to train&nbsp;students all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anyway, the challenges we often face in our courses deal with:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Creation of the materials. </span><span class="font4">Two sided: on one hand, the materials should be written in&nbsp;Spanish; on the other hand, most of the&nbsp;“technical” documentation lacks a DH perspective (Ej. PHP, MySQL databases). This is&nbsp;a very important point, as although there are&nbsp;a lot of open access materials on the web on&nbsp;DH training, it has not been enough for us to&nbsp;translate them (Cordell 2015). It has been&nbsp;necessary to re-create the problems, to&nbsp;adapt existing materials to our own needs&nbsp;and examples (our libraries, our projects),&nbsp;and also to regroup the different cues on a&nbsp;not-yet consolidated DH history in Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font4">Teach an eminently hands-on field through a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">distant method and virtual learning </span><span class="font4">(Forum, exercises). This has been one of our&nbsp;main pillars, in which we are proud to present our most innovative product in the DH&nbsp;world: online teaching has proven to be the&nbsp;present and the future of education, but has&nbsp;not been extended yet to the DH field (Bergmann 2013, Koller 2012). This way of teaching implies, however a specialized production of teaching materials and also a special&nbsp;faculty training, as they have to produce&nbsp;slides, videos, written materials and quizzes&nbsp;and tests for which they have to offer interactive help and solutions. Although this&nbsp;might look an extra workload for our teachers, the experience shows that all these efforts remain as digital contents (it is nice to&nbsp;have a look at the libraries of our </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">YouTube&nbsp;channel</span><span class="font4">), in which we add as open access&nbsp;materials all the recorded sessions of our&nbsp;courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Make visible </span><span class="font4">the DH training inside and outside the Spanish speaking world. This is an important point for us, not just as a way of&nbsp;getting more students, but also as a way of&nbsp;clearing the path to consolidating DH as an&nbsp;academic discipline (Trejos 2013). As our academic structure is pretty resistant to interdisciplinary work, we have to use social networks and other dissemination channels to&nbsp;go beyond barriers and reach our public outside our university. The result is a very&nbsp;mixed group of students coming from different parts of our country, and from other&nbsp;countries too. The challenge: identifying the&nbsp;ways to arrive at all these potentially interested groups. We work together in collaboration with scholars from Argentina, Mexico,&nbsp;Colombia and other universities and try to&nbsp;expand our visibility as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this presentation we will explore the success and difficulties we have faced in the use of this combined&nbsp;methodological approach during this 3 years, involving more than 500 students of different backgrounds,&nbsp;languages and countries. Expanding this model to&nbsp;other teaching programs and continue experimenting&nbsp;with new DH curricula proposal are the next plans at&nbsp;LINHD.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
