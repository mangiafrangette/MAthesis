<p><span class="font3">The development of well-known institutional digital humanities programs-- such as those at the&nbsp;University of Virginia, University of Victoria,&nbsp;University of Maryland, and others -- has been&nbsp;significantly influenced by unique combinations of&nbsp;dynamic individuals and receptive institutional&nbsp;circumstances. Faculty and administrators in&nbsp;leadership positions at a growing number of&nbsp;universities are interested in developing some form of&nbsp;institutional support for digital humanities research&nbsp;and/or pedagogical practices, but are starting with a&nbsp;fragmented local landscape. Where previous work has&nbsp;focused on particular facets of successful digital&nbsp;humanities programs (e.g. organizational models in&nbsp;Maron &amp; Pickle 2014), addressed digital humanities&nbsp;within a particular organizational context (e.g. in&nbsp;libraries, Varner &amp; Hswe 2016 and Schaffner &amp; Erway&nbsp;2014) or provided case studies from a single&nbsp;institution (Maron 2011), to date there has not been a&nbsp;holistic framework that can serve as a guide for&nbsp;improving institutional support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spring 2016, the EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR) and the Coalition for Networked&nbsp;Information (CNI) convened a working group of fifteen&nbsp;library and IT professionals representing a wide range&nbsp;of institution types in the US and Canada, with the goal&nbsp;of developing a “maturity framework” for institutions&nbsp;that are either getting started on developing a digital&nbsp;humanities support program/center or striving make&nbsp;additional progress with their existing efforts. While&nbsp;the maturity framework model is commonly used in&nbsp;ECAR working group publications to describe the&nbsp;adoption or implementation of new technologies or&nbsp;methodologies, particularly in an IT context, the&nbsp;working group quickly reached a unified decision that&nbsp;“maturity” was the wrong model for the development&nbsp;of a digital humanities program. Instead, the working&nbsp;group adopted a similar structure -- using defined&nbsp;stages of development across multiple parameters--and termed it a “capacity building framework”, in&nbsp;order to acknowledge that different institutions may&nbsp;prioritize different kinds of capacity, and those choices&nbsp;have little bearing on the “maturity” of the program as&nbsp;a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The working group’s recently-published white paper identifies five major facets of developing&nbsp;institutional support for digital humanities, and&nbsp;characterizes for each one three stages in the&nbsp;development of institutional digital humanities&nbsp;support: early, established and high capacity. The&nbsp;paper acknowledges that different institution types,&nbsp;and even individual institutions, will choose different&nbsp;areas to prioritize, and there is no “one-size-fits-all”&nbsp;recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Governance </span><span class="font3">-- how, and at what level(s), are&nbsp;decisions made? At the early stage, there is no&nbsp;governance in place beyond the individual&nbsp;project level. As a result, individual projects or&nbsp;courses flourish, or fail to do so, largely based on&nbsp;individual PIs’ personal connections and ability&nbsp;to secure funding and resources. For well-connected and charismatic scholars, the early&nbsp;stage may seem like the ideal one, as there are&nbsp;no systems in place to impede them from&nbsp;making any technical decision that suits them,&nbsp;and involving as many support staff as they can&nbsp;convince to participate. While the early stage&nbsp;model may be conducive to individual project&nbsp;capacity, given a particular kind of PI, it does&nbsp;little to build capacity at the institutional level.&nbsp;The white paper takes the position that&nbsp;governance is an important aspect of&nbsp;institutional capacity-building, by providing&nbsp;structures for transparent decision-making that&nbsp;apply equally to all projects. Depending on the&nbsp;institution, governance structures may be in&nbsp;place to determine allocation of internal grant&nbsp;funding or consulting resources, coordinate the&nbsp;purchase of software licenses or expensive&nbsp;hardware, and/or provide input into larger&nbsp;decisions in program development (e.g.&nbsp;whether or how to offer degree programs,&nbsp;whether to participate in consortial efforts to&nbsp;develop infrastructure or training programs,&nbsp;etc.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Infrastructure </span><span class="font3">-- providing access to both&nbsp;technology and expertise -- sits at the core of&nbsp;institutional support programs for digital&nbsp;humanities. The specific tools and resources&nbsp;provided can vary across institutions,&nbsp;depending on the needs and interests of&nbsp;researchers and instructors, as well as the&nbsp;particular skills and expertise of those&nbsp;providing support. The white paper notes that&nbsp;the effectiveness of technical infrastructure is&nbsp;contingent upon the availability of experts who&nbsp;can help scholars make use of that technology.&nbsp;While this is especially true for resources that&nbsp;have a high barrier to entry (such as high&nbsp;performance computing clusters), it also applies&nbsp;to software (e.g. for GIS, 3D modeling, text&nbsp;analysis, and OCR) and more prosaic&nbsp;infrastructure such as web hosting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Roles and Capabilities </span><span class="font3">-- successful digital&nbsp;humanities work is most often conducted in&nbsp;teams, with roles and capabilities from three&nbsp;complementary categories: technical experts,&nbsp;champions of engagement, and content&nbsp;innovators. Within these broad categories,&nbsp;there is great deal of overlap and&nbsp;interdependence; and it is through the overlap&nbsp;of roles and interdependence of capabilities that&nbsp;DH can flourish. Depending on the&nbsp;organizational model in place, projects may&nbsp;draw upon skilled collaborators at various&nbsp;places within an institution (e.g. museums and&nbsp;archives, central IT units) or even at other&nbsp;institutions through consortial agreements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Communication and Outreach </span><span class="font3">-- in the early&nbsp;stage of institutional support for digital&nbsp;humanities, individual practitioners are not&nbsp;aware of one another, and there are no&nbsp;established channels for disseminating news&nbsp;and announcements about events, workshops,&nbsp;grants, and other opportunities relevant to&nbsp;digital humanities. As institutional support&nbsp;becomes established, digital humanities mailing&nbsp;lists and event calendars are created, funding is&nbsp;accessible for one-off events and activities, and&nbsp;beginner-oriented training becomes available.&nbsp;High capacity for communications and outreach&nbsp;involves coordinated, regular communication,&nbsp;dedicated funding for activities, and multiple&nbsp;levels of training covering a range of skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Acceptance </span><span class="font3">-- i.e. the acceptance of digital humanities work as a component of promotion&nbsp;and tenure, of course assessment, and of&nbsp;performance reviews for librarians and IT staff.&nbsp;The white paper notes that academic&nbsp;acceptance of digital humanities work is&nbsp;significantly influenced by developments within&nbsp;particular disciplines, for example, the&nbsp;development of guidelines such as those&nbsp;produced by the Modern Language Association&nbsp;(2012), American Historical Association (2015),&nbsp;and College Art Association (2016) for&nbsp;evaluating digital humanities scholarship.&nbsp;Nonetheless, an institution can increase its&nbsp;capacity at the local level by having department&nbsp;chairs, deans and provosts publicly take a&nbsp;position supporting the assessment of digital&nbsp;scholarship as part of tenure dossiers and&nbsp;advocate for the consistent application of&nbsp;disciplinary guidelines, where available.&nbsp;Acceptance of digital humanities also applies to&nbsp;the evaluation of courses with digital&nbsp;humanities components, as well as to&nbsp;performance evaluations for librarians and staff&nbsp;who support digital humanities work. In the&nbsp;early stage, librarians and IT staff provide&nbsp;digital humanities support “on the margins” of&nbsp;their jobs, whereas at a higher-capacity stage,&nbsp;digital humanities support is an officially&nbsp;recognized aspect of IT staff and librarians’ job&nbsp;descriptions, and is factored into performance&nbsp;evaluations accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To complement the capacity building framework, the white paper includes a section on getting started with&nbsp;developing institutional capacity. This section has&nbsp;pointers for how to do an environmental scan and&nbsp;needs assessment, a discussion of interdisciplinarity,&nbsp;recommendations for the kinds of partnerships that&nbsp;support institutional capacity-building, and a number&nbsp;of commonly-used organizational models.</span></p>
