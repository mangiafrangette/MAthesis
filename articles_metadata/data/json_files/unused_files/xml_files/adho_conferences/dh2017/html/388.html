<p><span class="font4">GutenTag is a cutting-edge resource that allows literary researchers of all levels of technical expertise&nbsp;to perform large-scale computational literary analysis.&nbsp;It allows users to build large, clean, highly customized&nbsp;worksets and then either analyse them in-system or&nbsp;export them as plain text or richly-encoded TEI. It has&nbsp;been built from the ground up by literary scholars for&nbsp;literary scholars: rather than relying on off-the-shelf&nbsp;tools poorly suited to the domain of literature, we have&nbsp;developed many of the components ourselves based&nbsp;on the specific demands of literary research. GutenTag&nbsp;is fully open-source, its analyses are based on entirely&nbsp;open corpora, and researchers can save and distribute&nbsp;all the parameters of their analyses, allowing for&nbsp;unprecedented reproducibility of research in a field&nbsp;plagued by siloed corpora. GutenTag is easy to use,&nbsp;permitting casual non-programmers to perform&nbsp;complex computational literary analysis via an online&nbsp;interface, while offering additional offline&nbsp;customization options to more advanced users.&nbsp;Although GutenTag was initially designed to facilitate&nbsp;our own research in polyvocality and dialogism, we&nbsp;show here that it can be leveraged to intervene in&nbsp;pressing debates unrelated to our specific research,&nbsp;such as the discussion surrounding Matthew Jockers's&nbsp;analysis of gender in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Macroanalysis.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Overview of GutenTag</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">The system has grown considerably since our initial proposal, presented to an audience of computer&nbsp;scientists (Brooke et al., 2015). Below, we review the&nbsp;main features of the software with particular emphasis&nbsp;on recent improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Interface: </span><span class="font4">GutenTag is primarily accessed through an HTML GUI, accessible via the web or as a&nbsp;downloadable tool (both can be accessed from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.projectgutentag.org">http://www.projectgutentag.org</a>). In offline mode, the&nbsp;configuration files can be saved and loaded, and&nbsp;additional lexicons and other lists used for analysis can&nbsp;be specified by the user. A Python API is also included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Corpora: </span><span class="font4">The original version supported only the 2010 image of Project Gutenberg USA, but we have&nbsp;expanded support to all texts from Project Gutenberg&nbsp;USA as well as Project Gutenberg Canada and&nbsp;Australia, which include many additional texts&nbsp;published after 1922 and still under copyright in the&nbsp;USA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Metadata: </span><span class="font4">Document collections of interest can be defined using a variety of metadata tags. These include&nbsp;metadata provided by Project Gutenberg (title, author,&nbsp;author birth, author death, and, for some texts, Library&nbsp;of Congress classification and subjects). We have&nbsp;added genre (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama),&nbsp;determined using a sophisticated machine classifier, as&nbsp;well as author and text information (author gender,&nbsp;author nationality, publication date, publication&nbsp;country, single work or collection, etc.) derived from&nbsp;(mostly) unstructured resources including Wikipedia&nbsp;and the texts themselves.</span></p><img src="388_files/388-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:207pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1: The GutenTag interface, showing the creation of a workset based on advanced metadata (Genre, Author Sex,&nbsp;Author Nationality, Date of Publication)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Text cleaning and tokenization: </span><span class="font4">Sophisticated regex-based heuristics are applied to remove metatext elements related to Project Gutenberg before,&nbsp;after, and sometimes within the text boundaries.&nbsp;Literature-specific tokenization is provided,&nbsp;preserving important information needed for&nbsp;downstream analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Structural Tagging: </span><span class="font4">This module identifies the main structural elements of the texts. First, heuristics&nbsp;are used to identify the likely boundaries between&nbsp;front matter, body, and back matter. Identification of&nbsp;structure within the main text is driven primarily by&nbsp;the identification of headers, and fully supports&nbsp;recursive structures including entire embedded texts&nbsp;which can have their own front and back matter&nbsp;separate from that of the anthology. Structural tagging&nbsp;is sensitive to genre: in the context of fiction, we&nbsp;identify parts, chapters, and speech; for poetry, we&nbsp;identify poems, cantos, stanzas, and lines; for drama,&nbsp;we identify acts, scenes, speakers, speech, and stage&nbsp;directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Lexical tagging: </span><span class="font4">GutenTag includes lemmatization and POS tagging. There are several built-in lexicons&nbsp;which capture semantic and stylistic distinctions, and&nbsp;users can define their own lexicons, including&nbsp;multiword lexicons. Most recently, and most relevant&nbsp;to our case study below, we have added our own state-of-the-art literature-specific named entity recognition&nbsp;system (LitNER) which bootstraps from context-based&nbsp;clustering of common named entities to distinguish&nbsp;previously unseen people and locations from other&nbsp;named entities (Brooke et al. 2016b). For fiction, we&nbsp;group individual person names into collections of&nbsp;characters, and then assign speech events to these&nbsp;characters in the vicinity, using efficient, rule-based&nbsp;logic inspired by work in He et al. (2013). We identify&nbsp;the indicated sex of these characters primarily using&nbsp;large lists of names and titles; when a name does not&nbsp;appear on our list, we fall back to matching common&nbsp;sex-indicative character n-grams automatically&nbsp;derived from those lists (e.g. names ending with “a”&nbsp;tend to be female).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TEI output: </span><span class="font4">When corpus output is required, we use XML-based TEI format as the default output format&nbsp;when structure (rather than simply tokens) is&nbsp;requested.</span></p><img src="388_files/388-2.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:169pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 2: The GutenTag interface, showing in-system options for analysis via textual measure</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Analysis: </span><span class="font4">In addition to building corpora for exporting, GutenTag users can directly compare the&nbsp;distribution of relevant lexical tags or other textual&nbsp;metrics across multiple corpora as defined in the&nbsp;metadata filtering phase. The latest version includes a&nbsp;selection of standard textual metrics (e.g. average&nbsp;sentence length), part-of-speech based metrics such as&nbsp;lexical density, and metrics that rely on&nbsp;structural/lexical tagging, such as the amount of&nbsp;dialogue and the amount of dialogue that has been&nbsp;assigned to female characters. Advanced users can&nbsp;easily define their own textual metrics using Python;&nbsp;these then become available through the main&nbsp;interface. We also welcome requests for metrics from&nbsp;the DH community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Research Applications</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GutenTag was initially developed to facilitate our own research in literary dialogism (Hammond et al.&nbsp;2016, Brooke et al. 2016a). GutenTag allows us to&nbsp;perform three crucial steps in our research process:&nbsp;first, to build customized corpora (a set of novels&nbsp;published from 1880-1950, for which it yields 4,088&nbsp;results); second, to identify passages of character&nbsp;speech in each novel and assign a unique character to&nbsp;each passage of speech; and third, to calculate a&nbsp;measure of dialogism for each text using an algorithm&nbsp;based on our six-style approach (Brooke et al. 2016a).&nbsp;Further, GutenTag allows us to save our workflow in a&nbsp;parameter file so that it can be reproduced by other&nbsp;researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GutenTag is designed as a general system, however — not merely as a vehicle for our specialized research.&nbsp;We thus present an example of how it can be employed&nbsp;(by a non-programmer) to investigate a prominent&nbsp;debate in Digital Literary Studies, Matthew L. Jockers’s&nbsp;discussion of gender and authorship in Macroanalysis.&nbsp;Jockers argues that female authorship can be&nbsp;predicted reliably through topic modelling, based on&nbsp;the presence of themes that “correspond rather closely&nbsp;to our expectations and our stereotypes” such as&nbsp;“Affection and Happiness,&quot; “Female Fashion,&quot; and&nbsp;“Infants” (Jockers 2013). A reader might respond to&nbsp;Jockers’s analysis by querying his assumptions about&nbsp;literary authorship; specifically, his failure to&nbsp;distinguish between authors and characters. Suppose&nbsp;that female characters were just as likely to discuss&nbsp;“Female Fashion&quot; in novels written by men as those&nbsp;written by women, but that female authors tended to&nbsp;include more female character speech in their novels,&nbsp;as Muzny et al. (2016) suggest. If this were so, Jockers’s&nbsp;findings would not confirm stereotypes about female&nbsp;authorship, but simply reveal the tendency of female&nbsp;authors to include more female voices in their texts&nbsp;than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GutenTag is uniquely suited to investigating such a question. Its advanced metadata and sophisticated&nbsp;lexical tagging allow it to easily and rapidly analyze the&nbsp;question of female character speech in a large corpus&nbsp;of English-language novels.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">^^Female Authors • Male Authors</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 3: Mean proportion of text which Is dialogue in prose fiction, female vs. male authors, 1850-1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sample sizes as follow, in number of texts. 18501859: 53 female, 97 male. 1860-1869: 86 female,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">128 male. 1870-1879: 110 female, 137 male. 18801889: 122 female, 262 male. 1890-1899: 221 female, 583 male. 1900-1909: 299 female, 975&nbsp;male. 1910-1919: 354 female, 960 male. 19201929: 148 female, 656 male. 1930-1939: 77 female,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">413 male. 1940-1949: 52 female, 135 male.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Figure 3 shows that female authors in the twentieth century included approximately the same amount of&nbsp;dialogue as a proportion of total text length as male&nbsp;authors, but that in the latter half nineteenth century,&nbsp;they included approximately 5% more than men. Since&nbsp;Jockers focuses on the nineteenth century, this finding&nbsp;alone might impact his conclusions.</span></p><img src="388_files/388-4.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:145pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 4: Mean proportion of dialogue allotted to female characters in prose fiction, female vs. male authors, 18501949</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sample sizes as follow, in number of texts. 18501859: 53 female, 97 male. 1860-1869: 88 female, 128 male. 1870-1879: 110 female, 137 male. 1880-1889:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">122 female, 261 male. 1890-1899: 220 female, 583 male. 1900-1909: 300 female, 795 male. 1910-1919:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">354 female, 960 male. 1920-1929: 148 female, 655 male. 1930-1939: 77 female, 413 male. 1940-1949:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">54 female, 135 male.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Figure 4 shows, GutenTag supports Muzny et al.'s contention that female novelists incorporate far more&nbsp;(approximately twice as much) female dialogue&nbsp;compared with male novelists. The finding that the&nbsp;proportion of female dialogue decreased from the late&nbsp;nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, in both&nbsp;female and male authors, is one that bears further&nbsp;investigation — particularly in relation to the&nbsp;emergence in that period of popular genres, such as&nbsp;children’s literature, Westerns, and romance novels.</span></p><img src="388_files/388-5.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:143pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 5: Mean proportion of dialogue allotted to female characters in prose fiction, female vs. male authors, by&nbsp;nationality, 1850-1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sample sizes as follow, in number of texts. Scottish:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">31 female, 80 male. Canadian: 49 female, 78 male.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">English: 339 female, 1308 male. American: 572 female, 1545 male. Australian: 38 female, 104 male.&nbsp;Irish: 21 female, 92 male.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Figure 5, we employ GutenTag’s ability to filter results by author nationality. The marked discrepancy&nbsp;between proportion of female dialogue in male&nbsp;authors from England and the United States again&nbsp;suggests the need for an further investigation of genre;&nbsp;for instance, whether the American preference for&nbsp;male-centred genres like the Western might explain&nbsp;the result. Looking at GutenTag’s fine-grained outputs,&nbsp;we observe that the texts with the lowest proportion&nbsp;of female dialogue are those directed at a young male&nbsp;audience (especially adventure fiction for boys) while&nbsp;those with the highest proportion consist largely of&nbsp;fiction for young women (L. M. Montgomery’s Anne of&nbsp;Green Gables devotes over 90% of its dialogue to&nbsp;female characters). These findings might prompt our&nbsp;hypothetical researcher to engage in a smaller-scale&nbsp;study of the representation of gender in children’s&nbsp;literature. Because all texts in GutenTag are accessible&nbsp;to users, it easily accommodates such movements from&nbsp;large-scale analysis to close reading.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">GutenTag allows researchers of all levels of technical expertise to perform advanced large-scale&nbsp;literary analysis, as well as to independently test the&nbsp;hypotheses and conclusions of prominent research in&nbsp;the field. Our case study further shows how the&nbsp;integrated, end-to-end GutenTag system allows users&nbsp;to raise new research questions in the course of their&nbsp;analyses (such as the correlation between the&nbsp;emergence of children’s fiction and the proportion of&nbsp;female dialogue) and then, since all its corpora are&nbsp;accessible, to shift scales and explore these questions&nbsp;through close reading.</span></p>
