<p><span class="font3">For these reasons, we are pondering the differences between large university DH and small college DH: a&nbsp;diffuse, decentralized approach to DH versus a more&nbsp;systematic and integrated one. Our varied papers&nbsp;share several connecting themes: collaboration across&nbsp;disciplines, roles and institutions; and the central&nbsp;place of pedagogy. The idea of pedagogy is critical to&nbsp;the mission of liberal arts colleges, and thus will feature prominently in this discussion. We place pedagogy at the center of all our work. There is much that&nbsp;larger institutions can learn from this discussion, including ways to make DH more student-centered and&nbsp;pedagogically oriented. Without romanticizing student-centered projects (we will also address some of&nbsp;the challenges for public scholarship with such a variety of skills at the table) we want to explore how involving students in the co-production of knowledge -digitally mediated and publicly presented - shapes and&nbsp;reshapes what is possible under “DH.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">When we invoke the Digital Liberal Arts, we are not so much proposing a field that is by definition distinct&nbsp;from Digital Humanities—after all, both terms are notoriously subject to endless re-definition and contestation. Instead, we mean to strategically (and politically)&nbsp;call attention to the kinds of digital scholarship and&nbsp;pedagogy that are being conducted outside of traditional Research 1 institutions with well-funded DH&nbsp;centers. What conjoins our papers, then, is not so much&nbsp;that they present a series of new case studies in teaching with the digital: many people, we agree, could do&nbsp;that. Rather, we intend to prompt discussion and reflection about the kinds of infrastructures that are necessary (and perhaps not necessary) to produce sustainable and meaningful digital scholarship. Early on,&nbsp;Pannapacker proposed that small liberal arts institutions and programs might be uniquely positioned for&nbsp;rapid, more cost-effective innovation, because we have&nbsp;“shallower administrative hierarchies and less institutional inertia.” (Pannapacker 2013) All of us hail from&nbsp;programs that “share a culture of faculty-student collaborative research, which translates perfectly into the&nbsp;project-building methods of the digital humanities”&nbsp;(Pannapacker 2013).</span></p>
