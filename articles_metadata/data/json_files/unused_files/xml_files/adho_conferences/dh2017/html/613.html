<p><span class="font7">Early maps are usually only accessible for a small group of researchers and librarians because they are&nbsp;precious and fragile. In the age of Digital Humanities,&nbsp;online access and search in digitized historical documents and early maps allows people from all over the&nbsp;world to work with such artefacts of cultural heritage.&nbsp;However, the digitization solely generates images of&nbsp;the artefacts without any access to the semantics of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">documents. For most digital libraries of early maps</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(e.g. </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Old Maps Online</span><span class="font7">) the available metadata include only information about the map, e.g. author, title, size,&nbsp;creation date, covered region. Unfortunately, there is&nbsp;only little information about the data contained in the&nbsp;map. Thus, even if data about place development or&nbsp;toponym changes is present in the maps it is not easily&nbsp;accessible. Since a single map can easily contain many&nbsp;thousands of place markers, proper tool support and&nbsp;automation of the annotation and georeferencing of&nbsp;each single place marker are of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For modern maps or aerial photos it is possible to use GIS software to georectify the images by specifying&nbsp;a few control points, thus this problem is seen as&nbsp;solved. But early maps contain many sources of distortion, for example inaccuracies during surveying, combining data from different sources, focusing on creating a visually pleasing map instead of an accurate one.&nbsp;So there is in general no simple mapping between&nbsp;modern geocoordinates and an early map. Our existing&nbsp;Referencing and Annotation Tool (RAT) (Höhn et al.,&nbsp;2013) already simplifies the annotation and georefer-encing of place markers. RAT supports the annotation&nbsp;and georeferencing by using template matching to&nbsp;identify place markers and by suggesting the most&nbsp;likely modern places based on an estimated mapping&nbsp;between the pixel-coordinates and geocoordinates of&nbsp;the already georeferenced place markers. To further&nbsp;refine the suggestions a phonetic search can be used,&nbsp;where the historic spelling can be used to restrict the&nbsp;results to similarly sounding place names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even with tool support like provided by RAT the georeferencing and annotation process starts from&nbsp;scratch for each map. Despite the automation there is&nbsp;still manual effort needed for place marker annotation.&nbsp;Since early maps have often been copied from each&nbsp;other or share some underlying survey data, there&nbsp;should be some regularity between maps that we can&nbsp;exploit. To take advantage of the possible similarities&nbsp;in early maps we present an algorithm to identify similar maps and create a link between the place markers&nbsp;of these maps. This results in georeferencing an early&nbsp;map in relation to another early map, which can be&nbsp;much simpler than georeferencing in respect to modern data. When the maps are based on the same data,&nbsp;they share some of their distortions and so the transformation between them gets simpler. They will also&nbsp;more likely contain a similar set of places. This reduces&nbsp;the problem of identifying a matching place compared&nbsp;to a modern database containing all known places,&nbsp;even the smallest ones which will not be shown in medium or small scale maps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before we can apply the algorithm to a pair of maps we need to identify suitable maps. These are maps that&nbsp;already have some georeferenced place markers and&nbsp;share at least four mappings to modern places. Also&nbsp;the place markers in these maps must be already recognized, but not necessarily georeferenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The algorithm for linking corresponding place markers of two maps </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font7"> can be split in two steps:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1. Estimation of a transformation between the maps.The coordinate mappings in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7">, a bidirectional mapping containing the coordinates of the matching place markers in the&nbsp;two maps, are used to calculate the projective transformation between map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> and map&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">2. Extending the linked place markers. Using the projective transformation calculated in&nbsp;step 1, map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font7"> is transformed into the coordinate system of map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7">. We will refer to the&nbsp;transformed map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font7"> as map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B'</span><span class="font7">. For each place&nbsp;marker in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> the nearest place marker from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B'&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">is located. If for the place marker from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B'</span><span class="font7"> also&nbsp;the place marker from A is the nearest, following checks are done:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font7">The second nearest place markers have to be at least two times further away than&nbsp;the distance of the two place markers under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font7">Both place markers must be connected to some place marker contained in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">through edges in a Delaunay-Triangula-tion (Lee and Schachter, 1980) of map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">and map </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If both previous conditions are true, add the place markers to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M'</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M' </span><span class="font7">has more elements than </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7">, then set </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M' </span><span class="font7">and continue with step 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">M' </span><span class="font7">is the resulting correspondence between the two maps. The steps of the algorithm are visualized in&nbsp;Fig. 3. The right column corresponds to step 1 and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">left one to step 2. The rows show the different iterations of the algorithm. For all examples, the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">following maps</span><span class="font7"> are used: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Nova Franconiae descriptio/Sculptum&nbsp;apud Abrahamum Goos. - Amsterdam: Joannes Janfeo-nius, 1626</span><span class="font7">” referred to as Goos and “</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Franckenlandt =&nbsp;Francia orientalis/Per Gerardum Mercatorem - o.O., ca.&nbsp;1600</span><span class="font7">” referred to as Mercator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These example maps both contain about 900 place markers and an overlapping area with about 800 place&nbsp;markers. For Goos, all place marker locations have&nbsp;been manually verified and for Mercator, the result of&nbsp;the template matching was kept. This resulted in an&nbsp;automatic detection of the correspondence of 755&nbsp;place markers between the maps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another use case of this mapping is, that we can compare the automatically found place markers from&nbsp;two maps. We can highlight the differences between&nbsp;the sets of automatically detected place markers from&nbsp;two maps. This allows easily investigating the differences in the two sets of manually or automatically&nbsp;identified place markers. The identified differences&nbsp;highlight specific areas in these maps for further investigation. Two examples for detected differences&nbsp;between similar maps are shown in Fig. 1 and 2.</span></p><img src="613_files/613-1.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:60pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Figure 1. Corresponding map sections from Goos (left) and Mercator (right), where Goos has one place marker for&nbsp;Hoeltriech and Mercator one for Fuechstat which are both&nbsp;not in the other map.</span></p><img src="613_files/613-2.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:92pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Figure 2. Corresponding map sections from Goos (left) and Mercator (right), where Heibach is in Mercator located at the&nbsp;river and in Goos far away from the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There can be various reasons for differences between two maps. First, there could have been an error in the detection of the place markers, which then helps&nbsp;to spot such problems. Second, it is a genuine difference between the two maps, which itself can have&nbsp;many reasons, e.g. different decisions which places&nbsp;should be included on a map or errors while placing&nbsp;the places on a map.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This work shows that it's possible to create a correspondence between place markers in different maps with not more effort than for georeferencing a map,&nbsp;which then only provides the region covered by the&nbsp;map. A similar map can be identified, if one exists in&nbsp;the database, and the place markers between the maps&nbsp;can be connected. This then allows reusing the georef-erencing of single place markers from one map in the&nbsp;other map and identifying differences in the sets of&nbsp;place markers.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Future Work</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">This method can also be used to quickly identify similar maps and the differences in them. In this way&nbsp;it could be useful for researchers who want to find out&nbsp;which sources were used to create a map or who copied from whom. MapAnalyst (Jenny and Hurni, 2011)&nbsp;is an already existing tool for this purpose. If one map&nbsp;is considered as a possible copy of another map, Map-Analyst is a tool used by researchers to explore if this&nbsp;is true. The method proposed in this work would allow&nbsp;doing this kind of analysis on a larger scale while also&nbsp;highlighting the differences between the maps. Although this area was not our primary focus, we plan to&nbsp;evaluate the usefulness of our method on this task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The information from linked place markers could help in further analysis of other metadata items, such&nbsp;as place type or place name. The linked place markers&nbsp;already make this information available from the&nbsp;other maps and it could for example be used to improve the OCR process of place names.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Appendix</span></h1>
