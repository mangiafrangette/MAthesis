<p><span class="font3">With the renewed vitality of research in Artificial Intelligence, thanks in particular to the continued&nbsp;development of neural network techniques for&nbsp;machine learning, computer vision technologies&nbsp;developed for handwriting recognition offer&nbsp;innovative ways of conducting research in&nbsp;palaeography (Brusuelas, 2016; Hassner et al 2014;&nbsp;Muzurelle, 2011; Stutzmann, 2015)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this context where artificial intelligence often endeavours to replace human intelligence, or at least&nbsp;to emulate it, we are undertaking to understand better&nbsp;what it is that human intelligence does when reading&nbsp;ancient handwritten scripts. Ultimately, our ambition&nbsp;is to nudge artificial intelligence for palaeography to&nbsp;be intelligent enough to identify where human&nbsp;intelligence is still superior to machine intelligence&nbsp;(and therefore better left the upper hand) and where&nbsp;researchers can benefit from algorithmic support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Handwriting recognition is a challenging task -both for humans and machines - because handwritten scripts inherently straddle two interlinked spheres of&nbsp;intelligence: that of visual shapes, and that of&nbsp;semantics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This work builds on previous research (Terras, 2006; Youtie, 1963) that has identified six strands of&nbsp;human strategies in palaeography through&nbsp;ethnographic analysis, the results of which were cross-referenced with the cognitive sciences literature&nbsp;(Tarte, 2014). These strands were: visual perception,&nbsp;aural feedback, motor feedback, semantic memory,&nbsp;structural knowledge acquisition, and creativity; all&nbsp;continuously interacting with and feeding back into&nbsp;each other to some degree. In this project, we&nbsp;concentrate on the task of reading ancient&nbsp;handwriting - one of the many aspects of&nbsp;palaeographical research, whether it is concerned&nbsp;with mediaeval scripts or with more ancient scripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, we present some findings and observations made in the process of designing&nbsp;experiments to investigate some of the mechanisms&nbsp;underlying handwriting recognition in a&nbsp;palaeographical context; preliminary results from the&nbsp;experiments themselves are forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To explore in depth how humans handle the variability of the shapes of signs in a given script, our&nbsp;experiments aim to bridge between traditional&nbsp;ethnographic methodologies, geared towards the&nbsp;gathering of qualitative data, and cognitive sciences&nbsp;methodologies, geared towards the gathering of&nbsp;quantitative data. The script of choice was Demotic, a&nbsp;script of the Late Egyptian language and whose use&nbsp;spanned ten centuries, therefore displaying a large&nbsp;variability in shapes. The team of scholars involved in&nbsp;designing and conducting our experiments was made&nbsp;of: an Egyptologist/Classicist, an Ethnographer, a&nbsp;Neuroscientist, and a Computer Scientist. Many of the&nbsp;observations reported here stem from the&nbsp;epistemological encounters of very different&nbsp;traditions of research; they emerged through the&nbsp;interdisciplinary conversations that took place in the&nbsp;process of designing the experiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The outcome of these conversations was the following experimental setup, building on the&nbsp;principles of the protocols outlined by Althaus and&nbsp;Plunkett (2015) and Longcamp et al (2008).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Experiment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Volunteers are invited to two experimental sessions that take place in a library setting, where they&nbsp;interact with a tablet computer using a stylus. The first&nbsp;session is a learning session and the second is a&nbsp;delayed recognition session. The sessions take place at&nbsp;least one week apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the learning session volunteers learn to recognise 5 Demotic signs (target signs). This session&nbsp;comprises of a familiarisation phase followed by an&nbsp;immediate recognition phase. The familiarisation&nbsp;phase can comprise of one of the following three&nbsp;familiarisation conditions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">static passive familiarisation - 3-second&nbsp;repeated presentation of each sign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">static active familiarisation - repeated&nbsp;presentation of each sign with time for the&nbsp;volunteer to draw the sign on the tablet&nbsp;using the stylus</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">dynamic familiarisation - 3-second repeated&nbsp;presentation of movies depicting the&nbsp;drawing of each sign</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the familiarisation phase each sign is presented 8 times, twice in each of 4 distinct hands.&nbsp;The presentation order is pseudo-randomize to&nbsp;ensure that signs don’t appear twice in a row. Each&nbsp;volunteer is assigned randomly to one of the three&nbsp;familiarisation conditions. The familiarisation phase is&nbsp;followed by a 2-step immediate recognition phase. In&nbsp;the first recognition phase, pairs of Demotic signs are&nbsp;presented; each pair is made of one target sign and one&nbsp;distractor sign (the distractors are also Demotic&nbsp;signs), and in the second recognition phase words&nbsp;containing the target sign are presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The delayed recognition session comprises of three phases:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a delayed recognition, a repeated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">familiarisation and a re-enforced delayed recognition. The two delayed recognition phases are similar to the&nbsp;immediate recognition phase, while the repeated&nbsp;familiarisation is similar to the familiarisation of the&nbsp;learning session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the first session, all volunteers are given a short video introduction that aims to prime them towards&nbsp;scripts and writing before starting the experiment; the&nbsp;second session ends with a debrief where volunteers&nbsp;are given the freedom to ask questions about the tasks&nbsp;or scripts to the experimenter.</span></p><h1><a name="caption2"></a><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Negotiations</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In the process of designing this experimental setup, a number of fascinating questions emerged due to the&nbsp;intrinsic multidisciplinary nature of the project. The&nbsp;main interdisciplinary negotiations that took place can&nbsp;be summarised thematically as revolving around: the&nbsp;definition of an alphabet; the nature of script and&nbsp;materiality; and biases and mixed methodologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Alphabet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the researchers and the volunteers evolve in an environment where the default script is alphabetic, we&nbsp;decided to choose an alphabetic script. The choice of&nbsp;Demotic can therefore be questioned: Demotic is not&nbsp;an alphabetic script, even if most of its signs have a&nbsp;phonetic value. We wanted however to use real data -as opposed to an invented alphabet - so was there any&nbsp;context in which Demotic might have been used as an&nbsp;alphabet? From the Ptolemaic period onwards, the&nbsp;frequency of Greek names in Egypt is higher, and&nbsp;therefore documents bearing Greek names resort to&nbsp;transliterating them into Demotic. Although there was&nbsp;no received orthography for those transliterations, it&nbsp;becomes more acceptable, in this specific context, to&nbsp;consider Demotic signs as alphabetic signs (for the&nbsp;purpose of this experiment, determinatives, when&nbsp;present, were regarded as not part of the word).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In turn, this deliberate choice also made a search for images of signs written in different hands easier.&nbsp;By querying <a href="http://www.trismegistos.org/">http://www.trismegistos.org/</a> (Brouz&nbsp;and Depauw, 2015) for a list of Greek personal names&nbsp;in Demotic documents, and cross-referencing the&nbsp;results of this search with those from a query on&nbsp;papyri.info for all papyri in Demotic that have&nbsp;accompanying digital images, it was possible to&nbsp;identify and isolate images of Greek personal names&nbsp;written in Demotic on papyri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nature of script and materiality</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The question of the homogeneity of the signals presented to the volunteers is important in the&nbsp;cognitive sciences. However, isolating the signs from&nbsp;their support means possibly removing information&nbsp;(e.g. faint ink on more salient fibres of a papyrus,&nbsp;degraded or stained papyri). So in an effort to present&nbsp;realistic data, we have decided to use greyscale&nbsp;images, to crop the images of words/signs and to&nbsp;simply uniformize the overall look of the images of&nbsp;words by aligning their histograms; we have also&nbsp;endeavoured to present all signs in such a way that&nbsp;they have a similar size (so some scaling was&nbsp;performed).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A further question was that of the phonetic dimension of the script. From a cognitive sciences&nbsp;perspective, as the focus is on the visual, it didn’t make&nbsp;sense to add a phonetic element to the script at this&nbsp;stage. Only when it is better understood how the visual&nbsp;processes handle variability in shape, can it be&nbsp;envisaged to add a multisensory layer of complexity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This raises some intriguing questions with regard to the nature of a script. In particular, isn’t the essence&nbsp;of an alphabetic script to be a notation system for&nbsp;phonetic word utterances? What does the removal of&nbsp;its phonetic dimension entail for the script (regardless&nbsp;of whether the existing phonetic dimension is a&nbsp;modern convention or an actuality)? Are we&nbsp;denaturing the script by presenting its signs stripped&nbsp;of their phonetic values?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Biases and mixed methods</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Negotiating between the highly-controlled design of experiments in the cognitive sciences and the&nbsp;naturalistic settings and exchanges of ethnography&nbsp;proved complex. The main concern in such&nbsp;endeavours is to not compromise the validity of the&nbsp;gathered data with respect to the frameworks of the&nbsp;traditional disciplines. Free exchanges between&nbsp;volunteer and experimenter have the potential to bias&nbsp;the overall results for the cognitive sciences, as the&nbsp;bias is uncontrolled; it was therefore important for&nbsp;any such exchanges to happen only after all data of the&nbsp;controlled variables are collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even then, leaving space for free exchange within the confines of the experiment worried the cognitive&nbsp;scientists who feared to open the door to highly&nbsp;irrelevant questions or even somewhat leftfield&nbsp;questions (e.g. “Can you see my gift of clairvoyance?”)&nbsp;It appeared that such questions might be favoured by&nbsp;the running of such experiments in medicalised&nbsp;environments (hospital, psychology department), so&nbsp;we ran our experiments at the library instead, thereby&nbsp;establishing an environment resonant with our&nbsp;overarching theme of reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The process of designing these experiments as well as the forthcoming results have some bearing on the&nbsp;understanding of expertise of course, but also on how&nbsp;one might proceed when faced with a large corpus of&nbsp;unedited textual artefacts: Can crowdsourcing&nbsp;approaches be specifically geared towards the&nbsp;strength of the human visual system? Can algorithmic&nbsp;approaches palliate the weaknesses of the human&nbsp;visual system?</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgments</span></h1>
