<p><span class="font3">The project </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Mapping the Enlightenment: Intellectual Networks and the Making of Knowledge in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">the European Periphery</span><span class="font3"> is funded by the Research Centre for Humanities (RCH) for the academic year&nbsp;2016-2017. The project uses interactive mapping&nbsp;tools for visualising, exploring, and analysing the intellectual and geographical networks developed by&nbsp;Greek-speaking scholars of the Ottoman Empire during the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. Based on the convergence of the latest achievements in digital mapping&nbsp;and historiographical discussions about the representation of the Enlightenment, the project develops&nbsp;user-friendly interactive and dynamic web maps of&nbsp;the itineraries of traveling scholars, and visually represent the building of networks between scientific&nbsp;centers and peripheries. Additionally, this dynamic&nbsp;system provides multi-layered maps that enables users to query and visualize data and flows through a&nbsp;modern and robust environment. This interactive interface offers a simple and effective way of showing&nbsp;how the intellectual networks developed within the&nbsp;European periphery in the 17<sup>th</sup> and the 18<sup>th</sup> centuries contributed to the shaping of knowledge during&nbsp;the Enlightenment. The project is a collaboration between the Department of History and Philosophy of&nbsp;Science of the National and Kapodistrian University&nbsp;of Athens and the Centre for Digital Humanities of&nbsp;University College, London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The theoretical background of the project resides in the history of science. Following the general idea&nbsp;that the knowledge systems that gradually dominated European modernity have come into being&nbsp;through a dynamic and multi-layered process, the&nbsp;project is based on the notion of ‘moving localities'&nbsp;introduced by historians involved with the Science&nbsp;and Technology in European Periphery (STEP) network. The concept of ‘moving localities' enables&nbsp;historians to perceive circulation as a knowledge&nbsp;production process. Locality, in this sense, indicates&nbsp;a complex set of connections, allegiances and commitments which travel with people and thus extend&nbsp;beyond conventional boundaries, creating interconnected intellectual spaces over wide geographical areas. The sense of locality enables actors to perform&nbsp;distinct cultural identities in the course of their travels that are informed, but not confined by those assigned by their places of origin. Thus, locality can be&nbsp;said to be a local culture made active and open to&nbsp;transformation thanks to encounters fostered by&nbsp;travel conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The project takes advantage of the theories of the STEP network on the one hand and the latest&nbsp;achievements in digital mapping on the other, in&nbsp;order to create a visual representation of the above-mentioned concept of ‘moving localities'. The creation of a research tool will contribute to enhancing&nbsp;users' understanding of the emergence of modern&nbsp;science and technology as the expression of a dynamical geography. Addressing the spatiality of&nbsp;knowledge, the project focuses on associating particular cultural traits with specific points on a map, and&nbsp;work on tracking down the various paths and encounters through which such cultural traits and the&nbsp;respective knowledge practices evolved. In this context, centres and peripheries are not regarded as tokens of a steady, hierarchical geography, but rather&nbsp;as mutually dependent and co-constructed entities&nbsp;whose status can change with time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The development of the user-friendly interactive interface initially focuses on the intellectual and geographical travels of the 18<sup>th</sup>-century Greek-speaking scholars, who developed an extended network&nbsp;connecting the most important European educational centers with the most important power centers of the Ottoman world. Adopting such an approach allows more historical actors to enter the&nbsp;scene, such as the Portuguese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">estrangeirados</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;Spanish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pensionados</span><span class="font3">. The visualisation of the paths&nbsp;followed by the Greek-speaking scholars, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">estrangeirados</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pensionados</span><span class="font3"> enriches this historical and digital representation of the Enlightenment in the periphery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The technical plan aims to use and supports open source software. The project ambitiously strives to&nbsp;make every possible bit of information queryable&nbsp;and visualised. On the server side, Apache, Post-greSQL, PHP and GeoServer with PostGIS library are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the principal technologies that are used for the processing and serving of the data. On the client side, the latest versions of the web standards model HTML5,&nbsp;CSS3 and JavaScript provides a modern and user-friendly user interface. Initially, the scholars flow&nbsp;data are processed, normalized and ingested into the&nbsp;geo-enabled&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PostgreSQL database. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">visualisations of the data are materialised using the Leaflet library and other JavaScript libraries such as&nbsp;D3.js, Chart.js etc. The combination of the above&nbsp;technologies gives life to our historical data by combining powerful visualisation components and a&nbsp;data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This project does not aim to create visuals and maps per se; instead, it perceives these techniques as&nbsp;the medium to assess and display the findings of historical research that critically challenges the received narrative concerning early modern intellectual European networks. The creation of a visual image of the dynamic, multi-layer process of&nbsp;knowledge-shaping in the European periphery challenges current digital projects which mainly reflect&nbsp;the mainstream positivist histories of the Enlightenment. The intellectual networks developed within&nbsp;and across the periphery are mainly absent from the&nbsp;mainstream histories of the Enlightenment and if&nbsp;they are recognized, they are typically treated as the&nbsp;paths of intellectually parochial scholars who were&nbsp;unable to fully embrace the ideal of modernisation&nbsp;through reason and science. Bringing such figures to&nbsp;the forefront, and confirming their role in the production of scientific and technical knowledge, may&nbsp;help historians tell more nuanced stories about the&nbsp;complex cultural encounters, which molded the European intellectual space and the multifarious&nbsp;knowledge exchanges that shaped the notion of European science and technology. By using modern digital techniques, we aim to enhance the picture of the&nbsp;European periphery as a historiographical standpoint in order to transcend the established spatial hierarchies and bring to the fore the continuous re-inventions, conceptual shifts and cultural adjustments,&nbsp;which are responsible for the shaping of modern scientific and technical knowledge. The proposed project presents an innovative narrative of the making&nbsp;of knowledge during the Enlightenment. At the same&nbsp;time, it constitutes a unique combination of the latest web and mapping technologies, and provides innovative means of storing, transferring, visualising,&nbsp;and querying historical data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We believe that this project is a perfect example of how Digital Humanities, through its interdisciplinary nature of binding together research in humanities with digital technologies, can generate new critical knowledge through the re-interpretation of data&nbsp;that might otherwise be obscured. In addition, with&nbsp;the use of the latest open-source technology in spatial visualisation, the project adds value to the field&nbsp;by providing a showcase of the evolution of relevant&nbsp;technologies and, more importantly, the ways that&nbsp;Digital Humanities can innovatively use them for research. Finally, the project has the potential to offer&nbsp;a basis for a more ambitious project on a larger scale&nbsp;following the successful completion of its first stage.&nbsp;The ultimate aim is to allow other researchers to&nbsp;submit their data to the open-architected and forward-compatible queryable mapping tool and provide a historically more accurate overview of the intellectual movements during the Enlightenment.</span></p>
