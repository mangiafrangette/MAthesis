 <head>Description</head>

    <p>The modeling of humanities data is a core activity (some say <hi rend="italic">the</hi> core activity) of the digital
humanities. The activity so described may take a wide variety of forms; often the term is used for any
compact description of a domain, whether in prose or in user-interface metaphors. Machine-processable
descriptions are probably more common, but these, too, vary: the definition of an XML vocabulary, the
table declarations for a SQL database, the data structures or even the executable code of a program may
all be described informally as offering a ‘model’ of some domain or other.</p>
    <p>The term <hi rend="italic">model</hi>, however, is here applied more narrowly to expressions in some well defined
formalization. Models are most useful when formalized in a declarative not a procedural notation and
when their logical import is clear. Formulating precise models can be difficult. Inconsistencies and
unforeseen interferences between parts of the model can easily creep in. With informal definitions, such
shortcomings can remain undetected for long periods, even until after the model has been put to use.
Formally defined models, on the other hand, can be tested systematically for logical consistency; their
consequences can be established systematically. Such testing can help uncover shortcomings in a
timely manner.</p>
    <p>Alloy is a tool for “lightweight formal methods”, which makes it easier to test the implications of
models and to check assumptions for plausibility, consistency, and completeness. Its usual application
area is the testing of software designs but the variant of first-order logic provided by Alloy is by no
means limited to the description of software or electronic objects. It has been successfully used to
formalize notions far removed from any software, including the nature of transcription, an application
of the type/token distinction to document structure, and fragments of Goodman and Nelson's
mereology and of Hilbert's formulation of Euclidean geometry. Alloy's logic is powerful enough to
formulate interesting concepts, while remaining weak enough to be tractable for machine processing.
Using Alloy's syntax, a modeler can formulate the axioms of a model and augment them by asserting
that certain properties hold for all instances of the model, or by defining predicates which characterize
particular instances of the model. The Alloy Analyzer can test the assertions and illustrate the
predicates, by seeking counter-examples to the assertion or instances of the predicate.</p>
    <p>This one-day tutorial introduces digital humanists to the use of Alloy for modeling. Topics include:

    <list type="unordered">
        <item>introduction to Alloy's logic</item>

        <item>compressed summary of Alloy syntax</item>

        <item>use of Alloy for formulating assertions and predicates</item>

        <item>describing individual test cases for Alloy</item>

        <item>Alloy's place in the larger context and Alloy's relation to light-weight formal methods, to other
            formal methods (e.g. Z), and to theorem-provers</item>

        <item>limits on Alloy's logic, from a theoretical point of view (how Alloy and other tools deal with
            Goedel's incompleteness result and Turing's halting problem), and from a practical point of
            view (modeling recursion using transitive closure)</item></list></p>

    <p>Examples will be drawn from domains discussed at recent DH conferences.</p>
    <p>Prerequisites: some prior exposure to symbolic logic and/or programming is probably desirable; failing
        that, highly motivated participants may be able to benefit from the workshop if they have sufficiently
        high tolerance for exposure to new material.</p>
    <p>Participants should bring a laptop computer with a current installation of Java; they may optionally preinstall
        Alloy 4.2 or they may install it during the workshop.</p>

<div>
<head>Target audience and expected number of participants</head>

    <p>Short answer: not a large target audience (but a choice one!); estimated attendance perhaps 5-10 (no
        evidence).</p>
    <p>The target audience consists of digital humanists interested in techniques for formalizing important concepts and tools for working with such formalizations. The tutorial deals with high level data modeling concepts. Some prior exposure to symbolic logic and/or programming is desirable; failing that, highly motivated participants may be able to benefit from the workshop if they have sufficiently high tolerance for exposure to new material. Participants should bring a laptop computer with a current installation of Java; they may optionally pre- install Alloy 4.2 or they may install it during the workshop.</p>

    <p>I'd prefer to teach this as a full-day tutorial; that allows time for a mixture of lecture-style presentation
        of information and hands-on exercises. A tentative full-day schedule is:</p>

    <head type="sub"><hi rend="bold">Half-day outline</hi></head>

    <p>If it's necessary to teach this as a half-day tutorial, I will have to require that participants work through
an introductory tutorial on Alloy before the course, in order to be able to go at once into DH-specific
applications of Alloy. In principle, this will be fine; in practice, some portion of the participants will
either not have understood the tutorial fully or will not have looked at it at all, so they will either have
to ask questions that slow down the group as a whole, or they will not understand what's going on well
enough to participate actively, so they will become observers of a tutorial, rather than participants.</p>
    <p>A tentative half-day schedule is:</p>
</div>

<div>
<head type="sub"><hi rend="bold">Session 1 (90 minutes)</hi></head>
