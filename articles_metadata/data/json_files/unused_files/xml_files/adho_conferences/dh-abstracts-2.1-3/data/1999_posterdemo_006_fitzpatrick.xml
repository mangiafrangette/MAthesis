                <p>The Unix operating system provides a set of flexible text processing tools that
                    offer the user features beyond those of standard concordancers including the
                    ability to compare and manipulate different types of text. We show how simple
                    tools can combine to accomplish sophisticated tasks, using examples from
                    lexicography and phonology.</p>
                <p>The creation of an English-Karachay (a Turkic language) dictionary involves
                    checking elicitations from native speakers, grammars, and glossaries against a
                    series of authentic texts for accuracy, citations, and words that do not appear
                    in our sources. Unix tools allow us to find words in context in the manner of
                    traditional concordancers, but they also permit the creation of three lists --
                    words only in the dictionary, words only in the texts, and words in both -- that
                    enable us to decide which words should be omitted from and which words entered
                    into the dictionary.</p>
                <p>Spanish text-to-speech systems are set at a faster rate than English systems. One
                    reason for this might be that Spanish words and phrases are longer than their
                    English counterparts. Unix tools allow us to estimate average syllable length
                    per word by counting vowels in English and Spanish pronouncing dictionaries and
                    showing that, on average, Spanish words have twice as many syllables as English
                    words. Word counts of parallel corpora show that Spanish also has more words per
                    text than English.</p>
                <p>The operations discussed here involve standard commands available on any Unix (or
                    Linux) system, do not require extensive training to use, and are re-usable for
                    widely varying applications.</p>
