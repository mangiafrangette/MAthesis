                    <head>1. Introduction</head>
                    <p>In seeking to capture consistent and distinctive features of linguistic
                        style, stylometrists have used a variety of textual indicators (see: Holmes,
                        1994). In the majority of stylometric studies, however, the choice of which
                        indicators to use in a given problem is left to the discretion of the
                        investigator. This practice permits the exercise of human judgement, and
                        thus can sometimes save a time-consuming search for suitable descriptors;
                        but it inevitably involves subjectivity. Very often the choice of suitable
                        linguistic markers is crucial to the development of an effective
                        discriminant rule; but, being subjective, it may not be replicable on
                        another problem.</p>
                    <p>The situation is similar in the related fields of multivariate pattern
                        recognition and machine learning (Everitt &amp; Dunn, 1991; Quinlan,
                        1993): most studies begin by presuming that a suitable set of attributes or
                        features has already been found. In text analysis this presumption is more
                        than usually questionable.</p>
                    <p>For these and other reasons, a number of studies have appeared recently (e.g.
                        Burrows, 1992; Binongo, 1994; Burrows &amp; Craig, 1994; Kjell, 1994;
                        Ledger &amp; Merriam, 1994; Bayer et al., 1996) in which the features
                        used as indicators are not imposed by the prior judgement of the analyst but
                        are -- to a large extent -- determined by the texts being analyzed. The main
                        aim of the present paper is to advance this trend. </p>

                    <head>2. Method of Classification Used</head>
                    <p>As studying the strengths and weaknesses of different classification
                        techniques was not the main focus of this investigation, a simple
                        nearest-centroid classifier was used for the tests reported in this paper.
                        This algorithm, as implemented here, uses a training set of examples with
                        known class membership to compute a centroid (multi-dimensional average) for
                        each category. Then on a fresh or unseen case a measure of distance from
                        each class centroid is computed and the current case is assigned to the
                        category of the centroid which it most resembles. This method is described
                        as "simultaneous key identification" by Sneath &amp; Sokal (1973). It
                        belongs to a class of similarity-based classifiers which McKenzie &amp;
                        Forsyth (1995), among others, have shown to be generally robust in practice.

                    <head>3. The Bristol Benchmark Suite</head>
                    <p>In many areas of computing, benchmarking is a routine practice. For instance,
                        when compilers are tested for compliance to a programming-language
                        specification, it is normal to apply them to a suite of benchmark cases and
                        record any divergence from expected behaviour.</p>
                    <p>Although benchmarking does have drawbacks as well as advantages, it does help
                        in setting objective standards. For example, it is arguable that in the
                        field of forecasting, the work of Makridakis and colleagues (e.g. Makridakis
                        &amp; Wheelwright, 1989), who tested a number of forecasting methods on
                        a wide range of (mostly economic) time series, transformed the field --
                        leading to both methodological and practical advances.</p>
                    <p>Even though billion-byte public-domain archives of text exist, e.g. Project
                        Gutenberg and the Oxford Text Archive, stylometry currently lacks an
                        equivalent set of accepted test problems. Therefore we at Bristol have
                        compiled a textual benchmark suite to meet this need. The current version of
                        this suite is known as Tbench96. Despite its deficiencies, it does present a
                        broader variety of test problems than other workers in stylometry and allied
                        fields have previously used.</p>

                    <head>4. Data-Driven Feature-Finding</head>
                    <p>The main focus of this investigation is a comparative examination of a number
                        of methods of data-driven feature-finding. Only methods that do not require
                        the exercise of judgemental expertise on the part of an investigator were
                        considered. Thus the feature types examined below share the following
                        desirable properties: (1) they are easy to compute; (2) they are
                        interlingual, i.e. they are not limited to the English language.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the simplest possible method of obtaining a set of textual features
                        is simply to treat each letter of the alphabet as a feature, i.e. to count
                        the frequency of each of the 26 letters in each kilobyte line. This requires
                        no background knowledge except that the texts concerned are encoded using
                        the Roman alphabet. At first glance this would seem not just simple, but
                        simplistic. However, some previous studies -- most notably Ledger (1989) and
                        Ledger &amp; Merriam (1994) -- have reported surprisingly good results
                        when using letter-counts as stylistic indicators. At the very least, this
                        establishes a baseline level of performance: more sophisticated features
                        sets need to outperform letter counting to justify their added
                        complexity.</p>
                    <p>To avoid restricting other marker sets to an unrealistic size, the baseline
                        technique included here is actually that of Ule (1982) rather than that of
                        Ledger &amp; Merriam (1994). Ule counted not just the frequencies of the
                        26 latin letters A to Z (ignoring the distinction between upper and lower
                        case) but also the ten arabic numerals 0 to 9.</p>
                    <p>A natural progression from counting the 36 pre-specified alphanumeric
                        characters in each text block is simply to count the frequencies, in each
                        block, of the 36 commonest characters in the training text as a whole. This
                        allows spaces and other punctuation symbols to play a role as
                        discriminators. The danger here is that such characters may be less
                        intrinsic to the original texts than letters. For instance, Shakespeare's
                        punctuation is mostly the work of subsequent editors. Nevertheless, it was
                        decided to investigate the effect of moving from letter-counting to
                        character counting. (In the two cases in TBench96 where punctuation is not
                        original, punctuation marks have been removed from the files held on
                        disk.)</p>
                    <p>If counts of single characters are useful as features then so might counts of
                        digrams be useful, or of higher-order n-grams. Kjell (1994) reported good
                        results in assigning <title level="m">Federalist</title> essays written
                        either by Hamilton or Madison to the correct authors using a neural-network
                        classifier to which letter-pair frequencies were given as input features.
                        This approach was extended to characters (not just letters) and generalized
                        to include comparison of trigrams and tetragrams as well.</p>
                    <p>Another type of textual feature has been used extensively by Burrows (1992)
                        as well as Binongo (1994), among others. Essentially it involves finding the
                        most frequently used words and treating the rate of usage of each such word
                        in a given text as a quantitative attribute. The exact number of common
                        words used varies by author and application. Burrows and colleagues
                        (Burrows, 1992; Burrows &amp; Craig, 1994) discuss examples using
                        anywhere from the 50 most common to the 100 most common words. Binongo
                        (1994) uses the commonest 36 words (after excluding pronouns). Greenwood
                        (1995) uses the commonest 32 (in New Testament Greek). In the present study,
                        the most frequent 36 words in the combined training samples of each problem
                        were used.</p>
                    <p>In addition, two novel approaches to textual feature-finding were tested in
                        the present study. These are described in sections 5 and 6.</p>

                    <head>5. Progressive Pairwise Chunking</head>
                    <p>The first of these derives what are called DOUBLETS in Table 1 from text
                        samples, by adapting a method proposed independently by Wolff (1975) and
                        Dawkins (1976) in different contexts.</p>
                    <p>This algorithm scans byte-encoded text sequences, seeking the most common
                        pair of symbols. At the end of each scan it replaces all occurrences of that
                        pair by a newly allocated code. This process is repeated for the next most
                        common pair, and so on till the requested number of pairings have been made.
                        The program used here assumes that ASCII codes from 128 onwards are free for
                        reassignment (as is the case with Tbench96) so byte codes from 128 upwards
                        are allocated sequentially. As output the program produces a list of
                        doublets. These need not be digrams, since previously joined doublets can be
                        linked in later passes -- thus building up quite long chains, if they occur
                        in the data, without demanding great computational resources.</p>
                    <p>The program thus gets away from the artificiality of using fixed- length
                        substrings such as digrams, trigrams or tetragrams. It is able to find
                        markers that are shorter than words (e.g. an affix such as `ed ') or longer
                        (e.g. a collocation such as `of the').</p>

                    <head>6. Monte-Carlo Feature-Finding</head>
                    <p>The last method of feature-finding tested in this study takes the idea
                        implicit in the progressive chunking method to what may be thought its
                        logical conclusion. Monte-Carlo Feature-Finding is simply a random search
                        for substrings that exist in the training data. Here this process is
                        implemented by a program called TEFF (Text Extending Feature Finder). This
                        finds markers merely by searching through a given set of training texts. </p>
                    <p>Essentially TEFF picks many substrings (3600 in the experiment reported here)
                        from the combined training text completely at random. The length of each
                        substring is also a random number from 1 to 8. All distinct substrings thus
                        found are saved and then ranked according to a distinctiveness measure, i.e.
                        according to a measure of their differential rate of occurrence in the
                        different text categories for the problem concerned. Chi-squared is used to
                        measure distinctiveness. For the present experiment only the most
                        distinctive 36 substrings were kept.</p>
                    <div>
                        <head>6.1 Elastic Strings</head>
                        <p>However, earlier trials of Monte-Carlo Feature-Finding (Forsyth, 1995)
                            have indicated that the basic procedure, as described above, tends to
                            generate substrings that are fragmented at what seem linguistically
                            inappropriate boundary points, even when they prove effective as
                            discriminators. For instance, with samples from the <title level="m"
                                >Federalist Papers</title>, a precursor of TEFF often found `pon' or
                            `upo' instead of `upon '. So TEFF incorporates a procedure that extends
                            each substring, as soon as it is generated, to the maximal length
                            justified by the training text. This refinement does not require the
                            program to have any knowledge of English orthography or morphology, but
                            it does eliminate the most glaring examples of improper text
                            fragmentation. For instance, applying this procedure to a list of
                            substrings produced by from the <title level="m">Federalist</title> data
                            the substring `deraci` became ` confederacies`. Other expansions

                        <p>The measure of distinctiveness used in TEFF is Chi-squared (Pearson,
                            1900), with expected values computed on the basis of equal rates of
                            occurrence in the various categories of text being examined. This has
                            been reported as effective in characterizing textual differences by
                            McMahon et al. (1979) and Hofland &amp; Johansson (1982). However,
                            Chi-squared has also been criticized, e.g. by Church &amp; Hanks
                            (1989) and by Kilgarriff (1996), on the grounds that overall frequency
                            does not distinguish words or strings that occur plentifully in only one
                            section of a text from those that occur more steadily throughout it.
                            Ideally we want markers that permeate a particular kind of text. Thus:
                                <cit rend="block">
                                <quote>"an ideal index should actually be a measure of permeation;
                                    that is, it should consider both frequency and distribution
                                    information."</quote>
                                <bibl>Stone &amp; Dunphy (1966), p. 33.</bibl>
                            </cit></p>
                        <p>In pursuit of this ideal, TEFF offers two measures of distinctiveness. In
                            the first, Chi-squared is computed using unadjusted frequency counts; in
                            the second, the square root of the count for each kilobyte line is
                            accumulated rather than the frequency count itself. This latter measure
                            penalizes strings that occur very often but only in a narrow segment of
                            the text. It thus has a better claim to be an index of permeation than
                            the unmodified Chi-squared score. Both variants were compared in the
                            present experiment.</p>

                    <p>These figures are aggregated over all 13 problems in Tbench96. Percentage
                        success rate is given because it is familiar and thus easy to interpret.
                        However, as different problems vary in the number of categories to be
                        distinguished (2, 3 or 4), the rightmost column gives a measure of accuracy
                        that compensates for unequal numbers of categories (Klecka, 1980).</p>
                    <p>Using an overall significance level of 0.05 Hsu's multiple- comparison method
                        indicated that all but three methods were significantly different from the
                        best. These three were: UNIGRAMS, TEFFSUBS using raw counts, and TEFFSUBS
                        using the square-root transformation. Only these three candidates remain as
                        realistic contenders to be the best method of the 10 tested here.</p>

                    <head>8. Discussion</head>
                    <p>A variety of stylometric indicator types have been examined empirically. This
                        has given rise to a preliminary `pecking order' among marker types based on
                        results obtained on a benchmark suite of text classification problems. This
                        ranking suggests firstly that it is worthwhile to allow non-alphanumeric
                        characters as textual features as well as alphanumeric ones, and secondly
                        that it is worthwhile to select textual features for distinctiveness rather
                        than simply by frequency.</p>
                    <p>It is also worth noting that one of the simplest ways of finding textual
                        features (UNIGRAMS, which just uses the commonest 36 characters in the
                        training texts) is also one of the best. Moreover, no advantage was evident
                        from using longer n-grams.</p>
                    <p>The two novel types of textual marker tested performed creditably. Both merit
                        serious consideration by future researchers in this area. DOUBLETS obtained
                        by progressive pairwise chunking would appear to be at least as informative
                        as common words, which have previously held pride of place in stylometry. </p>
                    <p>Of course this conclusion only carries weight to the extent that the
                        benchmark suite used here (Tbench96) is adequate, and it can only be
                        regarded as a prototype. Nevertheless the very idea of using an agreed suite
                        of benchmark problems is in itself a contribution to stylometry; and while
                        Tbench96 is admittedly imperfect, it already presents a wider range of
                        problems than customarily used, and provides a starting point for future
                        developments.</p>
