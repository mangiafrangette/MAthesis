__Abstracts Collection__    
The collection site provides a central, public location for search, discovery, and preservation of conference abstracts submitted by attendees to the annual ADHO conference. The software platform, eXtensible Text Framework (XTF), enables powerful indexing, keyword search, and faceted browsing for abstract documents, all which have been encoded in TEI/XML. The current version, a mostly out-of-the-box XTF implementation meant to be temporary, was first installed in 2004. The phase one work on the new version has updated, replaced, and rewritten the XTF implementation, customized the application for the specific requirements of the ADHO documents, added a branded user interface, standardized display and documentation, and performed initial improvements on the XML encoded data.

For more on the eXtensible Text Framework, see the site maintained by the [California Digital Library](http://xtf.cdlib.org). The platform is in wide use by libraries for maintaining finding aids and managing archival metadata.
  
All work has been performed by Richard Higgins for the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO).
