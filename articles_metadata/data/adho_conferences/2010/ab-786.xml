    <text type="paper">
        <body>
            <p>More than ten years ago what was called a meta-dictionary was proposed as a central
                part of the framework for a dictionary laboratory at the University of Oslo (<ref
                    type="internal" cRef="bibl5">Ore 2001</ref>). The framework has since functioned
                as a pivot in the combined lexical database, text corpus and manuscript editing
                system for <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> (Norwegian Dictionary). <hi
                    rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> is published in twelve volumes (to be completed
                in 2014) and provides a scholarly and exhaustive account of the vocabulary of
                Norwegian dialects and the written language Nynorsk, one of the two official written
                forms of Norwegian. </p>
            <p>The architecture of the dictionary framework described in this paper was based upon
                both explicit and implicit assumptions - and some of the latter were not only not
                consciously considered in the construction phase, they have also led to features or
                lacks of features in the system where we now see the need for change. In this paper
                we look at problems related to links between the meta-dictionary and the sources and
                show how some of the problems are solved. </p>
            <div>
                <head>The meta-dictionary?</head>
                <p>In the 1990s a huge amount of lexicographical source material (dictionaries, slip
                    archives and texts) was made electronically available by a national digitization
                    project. By then <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> had produced three volumes
                    out of twelve. Being a project started in 1930 the future of the project was
                    highly uncertain. Thus the original motivation behind the meta-dictionary was to
                    create a common web based interface to the background material by inter-linking
                    the material to a common headword list as a meager substitute for the edited
                    dictionary. A similar approach has later been taken by the <ref type="internal"
                        cRef="bibl4">Dictionary of Old Norse Prose in Denmark (ONP)</ref>.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> project was refunded and
                    revitalized in 2001. It was decided that the new project should be completely
                    digital. As a result a new version of the meta-dictionary was designed. </p>
                <p>An entry in the meta-dictionary can be seen as a folder containing (pointers to)
                    possibly commented samples of word usage and word descriptions taken from the
                    linked databases etc. Each entry is labeled by normalized headword(s), word
                    class information and the actual orthographical standard used. The working
                    lexicographers view the meta-dictionary as an easy access to systematized source
                    material. The chief editors use it as tool for headword selection and in
                    dimensioning the printed dictionary. The database used in the Cobuild project
                    for lemma selection from the corpus, is an early example of such a database
                        (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl6">Sinclair 1987</ref>).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> is a historically oriented dictionary
                    covering the period 1600 to the present. The time span and the focus on dialects
                    make the background material heterogeneous. The oldest sources are glossaries
                    compiled in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>/18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries,
                    mainly the results of work done by vicars collecting information about their
                    parishioners' language on request from the government in Copenhagen. For the
                    description of the word inventory of the current dialects surveys and especially
                    local dictionaries form valuable sources. The meta-dictionary constitutes a
                    bidirectional network. Thus the historical or dialectal dictionary linked to the
                    system can be used as an entry point to the entire set of information. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Building a dictionary net</head>
                <p>The traditional systematic overviews of the use of words in context have been
                    alphabetically ordered paper slips with each word in a small context and the
                    source information. The slip collections have gradually been replaced by text
                    corpora. In the <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> project the slip collections
                    are digitized and linked to the meta-dictionary, and a new annotating tool for
                    singular language observations has been developed. A standard TEI-encoded text
                    corpus spanning the period 1850 to present is gradually constructed. The results
                    from corpus queries can be stored and linked to the meta-dictionary. </p>
                <p>The old and the local dictionaries and glossaries constitute an important source
                    for historical and dialectal word usage respectively. Traditionally such
                    dictionaries and glossaries have been transcribed to paper slips and stored in
                    the slip collection. In the new system the dictionaries could have been included
                    in the corpus. This may be done with the newer dialect dictionaries. The old
                    dictionaries are written in Danish or Latin and would have introduced a lot of
                    linguistic noise in the corpus. As these dictionaries are important documents in
                    themselves it was decided to treat them as individual works documenting the
                    language view of their time.</p>
                <p>The modern dialect dictionaries are given an XML-encoding according to TEI’s
                    printed dictionary format. The 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> /18<hi rend="sup"
                        >th</hi> centuries' dictionaries are represented by printed, annotated text
                    editions of the original manuscripts. These editions have been transcribed and
                    given a TEI markup reflecting their structure, generally not compatible with
                    TEI’s printed dictionary format. Due to their systematic character,
                    &lt;div&gt;-elements can be used to organize the text into chunks describing
                    words and thematic sets of words. The “headwords” are clearly identifiable and
                    are marked as &lt;w&gt;-elements. The loose structure implies that there may be
                    more than one “headword” in each text chunk. The TEI-texts are stored as blobs
                    in a relational database. The TEI-texts are chopped up according to the entries
                    (dictionaries) and the text chunks (glossaries) and stored together with the
                    headwords (slightly normalized) in a separate table structure. </p>
                <p> In the early version of the system, the linking between these sources and the
                    meta-dictionary were on the &lt;entry&gt; level for the local and on the
                    &lt;div&gt; level for the old dictionaries. There was no information about the
                    keyword in the selected dictionary that was used to create a link. In some cases
                    when a &lt;w&gt;-element was removed an invalid link from the meta-dictionary to
                    the external text sets was left. Today the link is annotated with the actual
                    headword and the person responsible for the link. </p>
                <p>The process is automatic with a manual check: a daily job runs through registered
                    dictionaries and looks for keywords in a special metadata field in the database.
                    If the word is found but there is no existing link between the meta-dictionary
                    and this text unit, a link is created, and the record in the meta-dictionary is
                    marked as changed and will be forwarded to an editor for approval. If the word
                    is not found in the meta-dictionary, a new entry is created and linked with the
                    text unit, and this will be sent to the editor for approval (see also <ref
                        type="internal" cRef="bibl1">Fournier 2001</ref> and <ref type="internal"
                        cRef="bibl4">Gärner 2008</ref> for interlinking of dictionaries). </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>The meta-dictionary and other dictionary nets</head>
                <p>What constitutes a word is an unresolved linguistic question. A traditional
                    monolingual dictionary is a word form oriented index to a set of concepts and
                    meetings where each entry is indexed by a headword and contains a possible
                    meaning hierarchy with samples. Word forms denoting related concepts are
                    connected by cross references. The Wordnet approach is to focus on the concepts
                    and collect the word forms denoting the same concepts in sets of synonyms
                    (synsets). The synsets can then be organized according to a predefined ontology
                    such as in the Global Wordnet Grid (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl8">Vossen
                        2009</ref>). The two ways of organizing word information is fully
                    compatible. A word net can be converted to a traditional dictionary and a well
                    organized dictionary rich on semantic references can be converted into a
                    Wordnet. </p>
                <p>The current meta-dictionary was pragmatically designed 8 year ago. It has in
                    itself become a valuable lexicographical documentation system. The source
                    material spans both in time and space. Due to the practical purpose, that is,
                    editing a traditional dictionary, the word forms are linked mostly
                    etymologically. Thus an entry covers many concepts as does an entry in a
                    traditional dictionary. However, the meta-dictionary also groups how different
                    scholars have described the meaning of a word from 1600 to the present. The
                    resources comprise the old digitized paper slip collections, the dictionaries
                    and glossaries and stored results from querying the corpus. They all represent
                    collections of systematized language documentation in their own right and
                    premises. The entries in the <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> are in fact
                    just yet another source of (scientifically) systematized language information
                    linked to the others. However, the <hi rend="italic">Norsk Ordbok</hi> system
                    groups the information according to meaning and the dictionary is rich in
                    synonym relations. A future research project is to use the information from the
                    dictionary to create a second set of articles in the meta-dictionary in a
                    Wordnet fashion with semantic relations.</p>
