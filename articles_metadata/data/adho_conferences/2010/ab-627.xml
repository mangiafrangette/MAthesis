        <body>
            <p>We present research showing the possibility of finding stories in a digital text
                archive through computational methods. Referring to the concept of &quot;archival
                bond&quot;, we define stories as formed by documents that relate to a target
                activity. We developed a method called <hi rend="italic">paragraph alignment</hi> to
                find such documents and an interactive visualization to discover connected stories
                in context with provenance. </p>
            <p>Our method was applied to the challenges presented by the digital archive of a
                multinational philanthropic organization who awarded grants to cultural, scientific,
                and social welfare activities (1985-2005). Over fifteen years, the staff members
                deposited their work documents in individual directories on a shared server without
                following any record-keeping rule. These documents reflect the organization&apos;s
                activities in the areas of Science and Education, Art and Humanities, and Social
                Welfare. They also reflect the staff members' records creation practices, afforded
                by the cut and paste function of the word processor and the possibility to
                collaborate through the network. These digital aggregations are sometimes perceived
                as chaotic, defined as ROT (redundant, outdated and trivial,) and deemed disposable
                (Henry, 2003; AIIM, 2009; Public Records Office, 2000). Yet they are ubiquitous in
                the networked servers of many organizations, so our goal was to find a method to
                make sense of the text records within.</p>

                <head>Archival Bond</head>
                <p>A fundamental concept in archival theory, known as archival bond, describes the
                    relationships between documents in an archive as essential properties of the
                    documents (Duranti, 1997). While all the documents in a collection are bonded
                    through the collection&apos;s structure (McNeil, 2000), there are stronger
                    relationships between sub-groups of documents that belong to the same function
                    and/or activity. In the case of disorganized electronic text archives in which
                    the structure is nonexistent or loose, we suggest that the relationships among
                    documents be defined based on their content referring to a target activity. By
                    finding trails of documents that narrate stories about activities in context
                    with provenance, we aim to establish order, identify structure, and learn about
                    the archive&apos;s creators.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Paragraph Alignment (PA)</head>
                <p>We observed that in our archive, similar paragraphs about an activity are
                    repeated across short - memos and press releases - and long documents - annual
                    reports and board meeting minutes. As a group, these documents tell the story of
                    an activity. We also observed that in many documents the same personal names,
                    places, and institutions are mentioned in relation to different activities, and
                    that documents that use similar terms may not be associated with the same
                    activity. The traditional cosine similarity method measures global similarity
                    between documents. Given the characteristics noted in this archive, we
                    considered that calculating global similarity was not efficient to identify all
                    the documents about a target activity. Instead, we draw from local alignment, a
                    method used in bioinformatics to evaluate local similarity between sequences
                    (Gusfield, 1997).</p>
                <p>While biological sequences evolve throughout time owing to constant mutation
                    events, the parts of the sequences that directly participate in cellular
                    activities remain relatively stable. Therefore, global similarity between two
                    sequences is often less important than the local similarity, which is defined by
                    the highest similarity between any two substrings from two sequences. Efficient
                    methods for computing sequence similarities often follow a framework in which
                    sequences are broken into n-gram for similarity computations and then assembled
                    to derive an overall similarity (Wu et al., 1990). Here we adapt a similar
                    approach that we call paragraph alignment to determine archival bond between
                    documents. </p>
                <p>Our method contrasts with previous work on document segmentation (Hearst, 1994).
                    Rather than measuring inter-paragraph similarity within one document to identify
                    subtopic structure, our approach focuses on comparing the similarity between
                    document segments to identify topics across a collection. Hence the primary goal
                    of document segmentation is to minimize the variation of length between
                    documents for subsequent similarity comparison.</p>

                        <figDesc>Workflow to compute document similarity using paragraph

                    </figure>
                </p>
                <p>Each document in a set is broken into one or more ordered segments based on the
                    paragraphs in the document. If the length of a segment (including spaces) is
                    less than a pre-defined minimum number of characters threshold (MNCT), the
                    segment is merged with the following segment. We used MNCT of 1000, 750, and 500
                    characters. For each set of document segments we create a matrix of TFIDF
                    weighted term frequencies after stop-words removal (McCallum, 1996), and then
                    calculate the cosine similarity between every other segment (Salton, 1988). We
                    then process the resultant matrix to derive similarity scores between document
                    pairs, which are defined as the maximum similarity score between their segments.
                    For evaluation, we compare the results of the different MNCT with those obtained
                    by calculating cosine similarity as a measure of global similarity between the
                    documents. </p>
                <p>We tested the method in a set of 714 documents from the year 1997 with eight
                    authors. Date and authorship were preserved in the documents&apos; file name.
                    The evaluation was based on assessing seven document test-groups. A team member
                    familiar with the archive selected five query documents, each corresponding to a
                    different activity (test-groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) and two containing summaries of
                    various activities (test-groups 3 and 7). For each query document, the team
                    member also identified a set of related documents. For each test-group, both the
                    cosine similarity and the paragraph alignment methods returned a list of
                    documents ranked from more similar to less similar. The team member checked the
                    results against the content of the corresponding document labeling the ranked
                    document as a &quot;true positive&quot; if it was related to the query document;
                    otherwise the document was labeled as &quot;false positive&quot;. Results were
                    checked until the last true positive was found.</p>

                    </figure>
                </p>
                <p>The results show that the PA method with a MNCT of 750 characters returned better
                    results five out of seven times (test-groups 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7). For
                    test-group 7, the best results were obtained with a MNCT of 500 characters. In
                    this case the query document contained summaries of five different projects
                    accomplished during 1997, each mentioned in other documents in the set. This
                    suggests that although related documents in the set may not share similar global
                    word distributions, they share similar word distributions in some of their
                    segments. While the efficiency of the different MNCT depends on the particular
                    word distribution of the documents that are being compared, in general, the
                    smaller the MNCT used the higher the documents with less global similarity are
                    ranked by the PA method. The PA method did not work for test-group 3 which
                    contains sentences about activities most of which are not mentioned in other
                    documents in the set. Figure 2 shows a plot of the results of test-group 1 in
                    which the PA method with a MNCT of 750 characters performed the best. </p>

                    positive documents of five authors include: other planning documentation,
                    correspondence with potential contributors, the call for applications, a press

                <p>Through an interactive visualization (Figure 3) users can follow the connections
                    between documents to identify stories (PREFUSE). Each document is labeled with a
                    color corresponding to its author. The connectivity between the documents allows
                    the identification of a) stories, b) the authors involved in a given activity,
                    and c) connected stories. As the user interacts with the visualization, the
                    structure of the archive takes shape. Below is a snapshot of the visualization
                    interface showing stronger connections between a group of documents.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>This research has implications for the retention of digital archives. Using the
                    concept of archival bond as a framework we aim to make sense of ROT archives and
                    to unveil their stories. The results show that for documents that share similar
                    paragraphs, local similarity matters to identify an archival bond. The same
                    characteristic is observed in the biological sequence analysis that inspired our
                    method. </p>
