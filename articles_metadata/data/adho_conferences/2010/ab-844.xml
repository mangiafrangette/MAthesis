                <p>This paper will report on the first year of a 3-year grant funded by the <hi
                        rend="italic" xml:lang="FR">Fonds québecois de la recherche sur la société
                        et la culture</hi> led by playwright Patrick Leroux (overseeing the creative
                    component) and Michael Eberle-Sinatra (overseeing the academic component). The
                    specific nature of this group project is nestled in the promising dialogue to be
                    established between Romantic literature scholars, a theatre practitioner, and a
                    scholar preoccupied with the pedagogy of Romantic drama using hypermedia as a
                    template and an engaging interface.</p>
                <p>When artists teach, they never quite relinquish their initial creative impulse.
                    Historical works, while being taught for their intrinsic value and larger
                    pertinence within a literary context, nevertheless solicit a resonant response.
                    Classroom exercises in both academic and creative courses suggest that many
                    students engage in a similar empathic manner when allowed to prod, question, and
                    interact actively with a studied text.</p>
                <p>The “creative” component of this research-creation project with strong
                    pedagogical intent is precisely linked to an artistic response to the source
                    text, Joanna Baillie’s <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft</hi>. In addition to the
                    edited text, its scholarly annotations and commentary, and the filmed Finborough
                    production of the play, we will create workshop situations with actors and
                    students in which the play will be explored in rehearsal prompting us to
                    investigate other manners of staging the work and illustrating, through filmed
                    documentation, the <hi rend="italic">process of reading a text for
                        performance</hi>. Short video presentations of key creative and interpretive
                    issues will be edited for inclusion in the hypermedia presentation. The actual
                    process, whether filmed or not, will allow the actors and creative faculty to
                    fully immerse themselves in Baillie’s world and work in order to fuel their
                    resonant responses to them.</p>
                <p>This second creative component, the <hi rend="italic">resonant response</hi>,
                    will take the form of short theatrical pieces conceived for film. The nuance is
                    essential as the pieces will not be short cinematic films but rather
                    short-filmed theatrical pieces. The emphasis on speech, dramatic action, and
                    relationship to a defined theatrical space will differentiate these pieces from
                    more intimate, image-based cinematic pieces. The resonant responses could be as
                    short as two minutes or as long as ten minutes, in order to fully explore very
                    precise formal issues (a character’s speech, the subtext in a given dialogue,
                    what we couldn’t stage during the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century but feel we
                    could now). These creative pieces will be developed with Theatre, Creative
                    Writing, and English literature students and faculty.</p>
                <p>Existing TEI guidelines for scholarly encoding do not account for the unique
                    relationship between a play script and performance practice and history.
                    Scholarly encoding typically views the structures of texts in relation to the
                    protocols that guide how readers interpret documents. But dramatic scripts
                    require different kinds of reading and, thus, different kinds of encoding.
                    Performance-informed inquiry into play texts depends on a reader’s ability to
                    think about the range of possibilities—both historically distant and
                    contemporary—for theatricalization of a line of dialogue, a bit of physical
                    action, or a visual space.</p>
                <p>Additional historical materials on the theatre and culture of Baillie’s era will
                    be provided by team members. For our hypermedia resource to organize multi-media
                    materials in ways that will help students in literature classes to use the
                    hypermedia edition of the play, we will need to develop innovative
                    customizations of TEI encoding guidelines. Discovering how best to support a
                    student reader’s work with a historically unfamiliar dramatic work provides an
                    important test case for existing guidelines for XML encoding of drama.</p>
                <p>This project will take an innovative approach in several senses. It will use
                    hypermedia to try to solve a classroom problem created by plays with little
                    performance history or connection to familiar theatrical styles. It will also
                    test the limitations of the TEI scholarly encoding guidelines by exploring how,
                    in the case of play scripts, building hypermedia resources requires creative,
                    user-oriented strategies of encoding. The research-creation program will
                    illustrate how contemporary artists can engage with historical works, while
                    shedding light onto the theatrical creative process. Finally, our <hi
                        rend="italic">Resonant Response to Joanna Baillie’s Drama</hi> will combine
                    scholarly research on Romantic drama, practice-driven analysis, the creation of
                    new work, and hypermedia expertise.</p>
                <p>This particular research-creation program is singular and innovative in its
                    combination of academic close reading, dramaturgical analysis, dramatic writing
                    and theatrical performance, filmed theatre, and a resolutely pedagogical
                    preoccupation with a full and thorough exploration of the possibilities of
                    hypermedia edition.</p>
                <p>In addition to creating a prototype hypermedia edition, the project seeks to find
