                <head>Overview</head>
                <p>The Modern Art Iraq Archive (MAIA) project is a participatory content-management
                    system to share, trace and enable community enrichment of the modern art
                    heritage of Iraq. The focus of the project is thousands of works of art, many of
                    them now lost, from the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art in Baghdad. MAIA is unique in
                    that it not only documents the lost artworks, but also provides tools for
                    community enhancement of those works, allowing contribution of stories,
                    knowledge and documentation to the system, as well as syndication of the content
                    elsewhere on the web. </p>
                <p>For the past eight months, participants in this project have been building a
                    comprehensive virtual archive of the works in the Museum&apos;s various
                    galleries, including a database of images and information about the objects
                    (artist name, title, date, dimensions, subject matter, medium, condition,
                    current location, related works, etc). These significant national treasures are
                    displayed in an open format that invites participation from users worldwide,
                    including the Iraqi national and expatriate communities, and users will be
                    encouraged to help identify and understand individual pieces. The MAIA system,
                    which integrates two extant content management systems, Open Context and Omeka,
                    will provide a valuable research tool for scholars, students, as well as the
                    general public, but most importantly for Iraqis: these works of art form an
                    important expression of the Iraqi national experience. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Project History</head>
                <p>The Iraqi Museum of Modern Art, formerly the Saddam Center for the Arts (Markaz
                    Saddam lil Funun), was established in 1986 as Iraq&apos;s museum of modern and
                    contemporary art. During the invasion of Baghdad in April 2003, the structure
                    was severely damaged by fire and looters. Without security and protection from
                    the occupying powers after the collapse of the Baath regime, its collections of
                    approximately 8,000 modern and contemporary Iraqi paintings, sculptures,
                    drawings and photography, dating from late 19th century until April 2003, were
                    entirely looted. Prof. Nada Shabout&apos;s research based on sources inside of
                    Iraq indicated that while some works were smuggled outside of the country, most
                    works were still on the market for sale in Baghdad. At an early stage after the
                    invasion, about 1,300 works were found at the National Gallery&apos;s basement.
                    They have since been are stored at a facility administered by the Ministry of
                    Culture, without restoration, authentication or archiving. </p>
                <p>While the fate of the collection is tragic enough, what exasperated the situation
                    further is that the Museum&apos;s inventory and documentation disappeared with
                    the works as well, meaning that missing works cannot be traced or repatriated.
                    Nada Shabout has spent the last three years collecting and digitizing all
                    available information about the lost works through meetings with artists,
                    gallery owners, and art educators. In this time, she has found that the
                    situation is dire, with improper documentation and accessioning procedures,
                    scant publication and recording in catalogs, and a lack of inventory for the two
                    decades before the invasion. In the end, the richest available information is in
                    fact in the recollections of individual people; hence, the imperative to develop
                    ways for people to share their knowledge of these works. </p>

            <div>
                <head>Approach</head>
                <p>The MAIA prototype integrates two existing, open source, content delivery
                    systems, Omeka and Open Context. Omeka (<ref target="http://omeka.org/"
                        rend="newWindow" type="external">http://omeka.org/</ref>) is an open source,
                    collections-based publishing platform that allows individuals and organizations
                    to share collections, structure content into exhibits and write essays. It
                    offers customizable themes and a suite of easy-to-install add-ons for
                    customizing site appearance and functionality. Omeka brings Web 2.0 technologies
                    and approaches to academic and cultural websites to foster user interaction and
                    participation, while making design easy with a simple and flexible templating
                    system. Robust open-source developer and user communities underwrite
                    Omeka&apos;s stability and sustainability.<note>This section has been adapted
                        from: <ref target="http://omeka.org/about/" rend="newWindow" type="external"
                            >http://omeka.org/about/</ref>
                    </note></p>
                <p>Open Context (<ref target="http://www.opencontext.org" rend="newWindow"
                        type="external">http://www.opencontext.org</ref>) is a web-based, open
                    access data publication system that supports enhanced sharing of museum
                    collections and field research data by enabling researchers and cultural
                    heritage collections managers to publish their primary field data, notes and
                    media (images, maps, drawings, videos) on the web. It is free and uses open
                    source software built on common open source technologies (Apache-Solr, MySQL,
                    PHP, and Dojo Ajax) widely accessible and supported by a vast global developer
                    community. Open Context uses Apache-Solr to power a &quot;faceted browse&quot;
                    tool, which allows for much more informed navigation and understanding of
                    collections than the &quot;type and hope&quot; approach of simple key-word
                    searches. This component also delivers web-services, enabling a feed-based
                    approach to syndicating content and integrating collections distributed across
                    the web. These web-services represent a powerful, scalable, and elegantly simple
                    way to facilitate aggregation across multiple collections. </p>
                <p>MAIA&apos;s approach integrates features of these two systems to maximize the
                    collection&apos;s reach, discoverability and creative reuse. Omeka offers a
                    user-friendly platform for building, customizing and organizing the MAIA
                    collection, as well as allowing options for contributions and comments from the
                    community. However, search functionality is limited and Omeka content is largely
                    confined within each Omeka instance, despite its support of OAI/PMH and some
                    feed capabilities. Finally, while Omeka offers stable URLs for every item, Omeka
                    users need to make additional arrangements for archiving their collections. Open
                    Context complements Omeka&apos;s capabilities with a faceted browse
                    &quot;plugin,&quot; offering powerful web-service capabilities that enable
                    distributed search and syndication of content. These capabilities make Open
                    Context a more powerful platform for supporting aggregation and mashups. Open
                    Context&apos;s faceted browse tool provides a much more informed overview of a
                    collection, showing fields associated with content even for custom metadata,
                    allowing exploration beyond simple searches. The Open Context plug in will also
                    greatly expand Omeka&apos;s feed capabilities, allowing users to draw custom
                    feeds tailored to their specific interests (such as a particular artist, time
                    period and/or region). Any Omeka site implementing the Open Context faceted
                    browse plug-in will be indexed by Open Context, opening up Omeka content to
                    dynamic searching across multiple collections. Finally, Omeka collections using
                    the Open Context plug-in will benefit from accessioning by the California
                    Digital Library. Thus, Omeka&apos;s user-friendly collections management and
                    publishing functions are joined with Open Context&apos;s powerful web services
                    to increase the reach and potential for reuse of MAIA content. </p>
                <p>Taking advantage of the flexibility in content-management and sharing provided by
                    the integration of these two powerful, open source systems, the MAIA platform is
                    available for free on the web and offers the following additional features: <xmt:uList>
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Localization</hi>: All static content in the system is
                            translated into Arabic. Participatory tagging and commentary features
                            are also available in multiple languages.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Community input</hi>: A tagging system allows users to
                            comment on any item in the database, thus enriching the content and
                            helping build a memory of the lost works. Users can also link to
                            external content related to the works.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Citation</hi>: Easy citation retrieval makes MAIA a
                            useful research tool. Unique citations are generated for every single
                            item in the system, and Omeka expresses bibliographic metadata in a
                            format that the popular Zotero citation management tool can
                            recognize.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Copyright Pragmatism</hi>: The creators of many of the
                            works included in the website are unknown, and it is not possible to get
                            permissions from them to disseminate their work online. However, such
                            dissemination is essential if these creators are ever to be identified.
                            Therefore, this project hosts works even in cases where the creator is
                            not known. A clear &quot;take-down&quot; policy ensures that artists can
                            request that their work be removed from the website. In cases where
                            copyright permissions can be obtained, a Creative Commons Attribution,

                <head>Outcomes</head>
                <p>By archiving and documenting the known modern artistic works from the Iraqi
                    Modern Art Museum, this project contributes to the preservation of Iraq&apos;s
                    cultural heritage. However, the project&apos;s greater success lies in the
                    amount of exposure and the quantity and quality of community participation that
                    the project garners. That is, free global exposure of the known content is
                    helpful and informative, but active community input that enriches the works, and
                    perhaps locates some of the lost works, is ideal. We are currently working on
                    maximizing the dissemination of MAIA content, through the use of blogs,
                    interviews, publications and presentations. Our long-term vision for MAIA is
                    that it will become a virtual museum, where visitors will navigate through a
                    map-based interface, exploring galleries and viewing individual works of art,
                    ideally in the place they stood before the museum was damaged and many of the
                    works lost. In this way, the public will have a visual understanding of the
                    number of works still missing or for which no documentation exists. The
                    emotional impact of seeing blank sections of gallery walls is far greater than
                    reading a number or percentage, and will give the public a more profound
                    understanding of the loss of these works of modern Iraqi heritage. On a more
                    positive note, a visualization of the rich, related content around many of these
                    works will enrich the visitor&apos;s experience and understanding of any single
                    work. </p>
