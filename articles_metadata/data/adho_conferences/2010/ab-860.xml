            <p>This paper presents the outcomes to date of the annotation interoperability component
                of the Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) Project.<note><ref type="external"
                        target="http://www.openannotation.org/"
                    >http://www.openannotation.org/</ref></note> The OAC project is a collaboration
                between the University of Illinois, the University of Queensland, Los Alamos
                National Laboratory Research Library, the George Mason University and the University
                of Maryland. OAC has received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to
                develop a data model and framework to enable the sharing and interoperability of
                scholarly annotations across annotation clients, collections, media types,
                applications and architectures. The OAC approach is based on the assumption that
                clients publish annotations on the Web and that the target, content and the
                annotation itself are all URI-addressable Web resources. By basing the OAC model on
                Semantic Web and Linked Data practices, we hope to provide the optimum approach for
                the publishing, sharing and interoperability of annotations and annotation
                applications. In this paper, we describe the principles and components of the OAC
                data model, together with a number of scholarly use cases that demonstrate and
                evaluate the capabilities of the model in different scenarios. </p>

                <head>Introduction and Objectives</head>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Annotating</hi> is both a core and pervasive practice for
                    humanities scholarship. It is used to organize, create and share knowledge.
                    Individual scholars use it when reading, as an aid to memory, to add commentary,
                    and to classify documents. It can facilitate shared editing, scholarly
                    collaboration, and pedagogy. Although there exists a plethora of annotation
                    clients for humanities scholars to use (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl1">Hunter
                        2009</ref>) - many of these tools are designed for specific collection
                    types, user requirements, disciplinary application or individual, desktop use.
                    Scholars are also confronted with having to learn different annotation clients
                    for different content repositories, have no easy way to integrate annotations
                    made on different systems or created by colleagues using other tools, and are
                    often limited to simplistic and constrained models of annotations. For example,
                    many existing tools only support the simplistic model in which the annotation
                    content comprises a brief unformatted piece of text. Many tools conflate the
                    storage of the annotations and the target being annotated. </p>
                <p>Frameworks for annotation reference are inconsistent, not coordinated, and
                    frequently idiosyncratic, and the constituent elements of annotations are not
                    exposed to the Web as discrete addressable resources, making annotations
                    difficult to discover and re-use. The lack of robust interoperable tools for
                    annotating across heterogeneous repositories of digital content and difficulties
                    sharing or migrating annotation records between users and clients – are
                    hindering the exploitation of digital resources by humanities scholars. Hence
                    the goals of the Open Annotations Collaboration (OAC) are: <xmt:uList>
                        <item>To facilitate the emergence of a Web and Resource-centric
                            interoperable annotation environment that allows leveraging annotations
                            across the boundaries of annotation clients, annotation servers, and
                            content collections. To this end, annotation interoperability
                            specification consisting of an Annotation Data Model will be
                            developed.</item>
                        <item>To demonstrate through implementations an interoperable annotation
                            environment enabled by the interoperability specifications in settings
                            characterized by a variety of annotation client/server environments,
                            content collections, and scholarly use cases.</item>
                        <item>To seed widespread adoption by deploying robust, production-quality
                            applications conformant with the interoperable annotation environment in
                            ubiquitous and specialized services and tools used by scholars (e.g.,
                            JSTOR, Zotero, and MONK).</item>

                <p>In the remainder of this paper we describe related efforts that have informed the
                    development of our Annotation Data Model. We then describe the data model itself
                    that lays a foundation for follow-on work involving demonstrations and reference
                    implementations that exploit real-world repositories such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >JSTOR, Flickr Commons</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">MONK</hi> and leverage
                    existing scholarly annotation applications such Zotero, Pliny and
                    Co-Annotea.</p>

                <p>Despite the vast body of work regarding annotation practice, annotation models,
                    and annotation systems, little attention has been paid to interoperable
                    annotation environments. The few efforts in this realm to date comprise: <xmt:uList>

                <p>An analysis of these existing models reveals that on the whole, they have not
                    been designed as Web-centric and resource-centric, or that they have modeling
                    shortcomings that prevent any existing resource from being the content or target
                    of an annotation and from giving an annotation independent status as a resource
                    itself. Further requirements that we have identified that these approaches fail
                    to fully support include: <xmt:uList>

                <head>The OAC Data Model</head>
                <p>By exploiting the Web- and Resource-centric approach to modelling annotations, we
                    leverage existing standards and facilitate the interoperability of annotation
                    applications. In the OAC model, an Annotation is an Event initiated at a
                    date/time by an author (human or software agent). Other entities involved in the
                    event are the Content of the Annotation (aka Source) and the Target of the
                    Annotation. The model assumes that the core entities (Annotation, Content and
                    Target) are independent Web resources that are URI-addressable. This approach
                    simplifies and decouples implementation from the repository. An essential aspect
                    of an annotation is the (implicit or explicit) expression of “annotates”
                    relationship between the Content and the Target. The model allows for Content
                    and Target of any media type and the Annotation, Content, and Target can all
                    have different authorship. In situations where the annotation Content or Target
                    is a segment or fragment of a resource (e.g., region of an image), we will draw
                    on the work of the W3C Media Fragments Working Group to specify the fragment
                    address. Figure 1 illustrates the alpha version of the OAC data model. </p>

                <head>Discussion and Conclusions</head>
                <p>The proposed OAC Data Model will enable the sharing and discovery of annotations
                    beyond the boundaries of individual solutions or content collections, and hence
                    will allow for the emergence of value-added cross-environment annotation
                    services. It will also facilitate the implementation of advanced end-user
                    annotation services targeted at humanities scholars that are capable of
                    operating across a broad range of both scholarly and general collections.
                    Furthermore, it will enable customization of annotation services for specific
                    scholarly communities, without reducing interoperability. The proposed work will
                    also enable more robust machine-to-machine interactions and automated analysis,
                    aggregation and reasoning over distributed annotations and annotated resources.
                    By grounding our work in a thorough understanding of Web-centric
                    interoperability and embedded models implemented by existing digital annotation
                    tools and services, we create an interoperable annotation environment that will
                    allow scholars and tool-builders to leverage prior tool development work and
                    traditional models of scholarly annotation, while simultaneously enabling the
                    evolution of these models and tools to make the most of the potential offered by
                    the Web environment.</p>
