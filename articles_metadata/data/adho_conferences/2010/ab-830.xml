        <body>
            <div>
                <p>The world of character encoding in 2010 has changed significantly since TEI began
                    in 1987, thanks to the development and adoption of Unicode (/ISO/IEC 10646) as
                    the international character encoding standard for the electronic transmission of
                    text. In December 2008, Unicode overtook all other encodings on the Web,
                    surpassing ASCII and the Western European encodings (<ref type="internal"
                        cRef="bibl1">Davis 2009</ref>). As a result, Unicode’s position seems to be
                    increasingly well-established, at least on the Web, and TEI was prescient to
                    advocate its use.</p>
                <p>Over 100,000 characters are now defined with <ref type="internal" cRef="bibl2"
                        >Unicode 5.2</ref>, including significant Latin additions for medievalists,
                    a core set of Egyptian hieroglyphs, and characters for over 75 scripts. As such,
                    Unicode presents a vast array of character choices for the digital humanist, so
                    many that it can be difficult to figure out which character – if any – is the
                    appropriate one to use. When working on a digital version of a Latin text that
                    contains Roman numerals, should text encoder use U+2160 ROMAN NUMERAL ONE or
                    U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I? Should one use the duplicate ASCII characters
                    that are located at U+FF01ff. (and why were they ever approved)? These types of
                    questions can create confusion for text encoders. </p>
                <p>The process of approving new characters by the Unicode Technical Committee and
                    the relevant ISO committee is intended to be open, meaning that scholars,
                    representatives of companies and national bodies, and other individuals may make
                    proposals and, to a certain extent, participate in the process. Yet which
                    characters get approved – and which don’t – can still be baffling. On the
                    TEI-list, one member wrote on 1 August 2009: <q>What is and isn't represented in
                        unicode is largely a haphazard mishmash of bias, accident and brute-force
                        normalisation. Unicode would be dreadful, if it weren't for the fact that
                        all the alternatives are much worse.</q></p>
                <p>This paper addresses the question of which characters get approved and which
                    don’t, by examining the forces at work behind the scenes, issues about which
                    digital humanists may not be aware. This talk, by a member of the two standards
                    committees on coded character sets, is meant to give greater insight into
                    character encoding today, so that the character encoding standard doesn’t seem
                    like a confusing set of decisions handed down from a faceless group of
                    non-scholars. Specific examples of the issues will be given and the talk will
                    end with suggestions so that digital humanists, armed with such information,
                    will feel more confident in putting forward proposals for needed, eligible
                    characters.</p>
                <p>The Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) is one of the two standards committees that
                    must approve all new characters. Since it is composed primarily of industry
                    representatives, technical discussion often predominates at meetings, including
                    the question of whether given characters (or scripts) can be supported in
                    current font technology and in software. For the academic, the question of
                    whether a given character (or script) can be implemented in current
                    fonts/software is not one commonly considered, and wouldn’t necessarily be
                    known, unless they attended the UTC meetings in person. Also, the acceptance of
                    characters can be based on current Unicode policy or precedence of earlier
                    encoding decisions, which again is often not known to outsiders. How to handle
                    historical ligatures, for example, has been discussed and debated within UTC
                    meetings, but since the public minutes of the UTC do not include the discussion
                    surrounding a character proposal, it may appear that the UTC is blind to
                    scholars’ concerns, which is frequently not the case. In order to have a good
                    chance at getting a proposal approved in the UTC, it is hence important for
                    scholars to work with a current member of the UTC who can trouble-shoot
                    proposals and act as an advocate in the meetings, as well as explain concerns of
                    the committee and the reasoning behind their decisions. </p>
                <p>The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 Working Group 2, a working group on coded character sets, is
                    the second group that must approve characters. This group is composed of
                    national standards body representatives. Unlike the UTC, the WG2 is not
                    primarily technical in nature, as it is a forum where national standards bodies
                    can weigh in on character encoding decisions. This group is more of a “United
                    Nations” of character encoding, with politics playing a role. Discussion can,
                    for example, involve the names of characters and scripts, which can vary by
                    language and country, thus causing disagreement among member bodies. Like the
                    other International Organization for Standardization groups, decisions are
                    primarily done by consensus (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl3">International
                        Organization for Standardization, "My ISO Job: Guidance for delegates and
                        experts", 2009</ref>). This means that within WG2, disagreements amongst
                    members can stall a particular character or script proposal from being approved.
                    For example, a proposal for an early script used in Hungary is currently held up
                    in WG2, primarily because there is disagreement between the representatives from
                    Austria (and Ireland) and the representative from Hungary over the name. To the
                    scholar, accommodating national standards body positions when making encoding
                    decisions may seem like unnecessary interference from the political realm.
                    Still, diplomatic concerns need to be taken into account in order for consensus
                    to be reached so proposals can be approved. Again, having the support of one’s
                    national body is a key to successfully getting a character proposal approved. </p>
                <p>Since WG2 is a volunteer standards organization within ISO, it relies on its
                    members to review proposals carefully, and submit feedback. Unfortunately, many
                    scholars don’t participate in ISO, partly because it involves understanding the
                    international standard development process, as well as a long-term commitment –
                    the entire approval process can take at least two years. Another factor that may
                    explain the lack of regular academic involvement is that scholars participating
                    in standards work typically do not receive professional credit. Because there is
                    not much expert involvement in WG2 to review documents (perhaps even fewer
                    experts than in the UTC), errors can creep in. For many of the big historic East
                    Asian script proposals, for example, only a small handful of people are
                    reviewing the documents, which is worrisome. The recently addition of CJK
                    characters (“Extension C”), which has 4,149 characters, could have benefited
                    from more scholarly review. Clearly there remains a critical need for
                    specialists to become involved in the ISO Working Group 2, so as to prevent the
                    inclusion of errors in future versions of the character encoding standard. </p>
                <p>Besides the activity within each separate standards group, there are developments
                    affecting both standards groups that may not be known to digital humanists, but
                    which influence character encoding. New rules have recently been proposed within
                    ISO, for example, which will slow the pace at which new characters and scripts
                    are approved by ISO and published in <hi rend="italic">The Unicode Standard</hi>
                        (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl4">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 meeting, 2009</ref>).
                    The new rules will severely impact new character requests. Another example of
                    activity affecting digital projects, particularly those using East Asian
                    characters, was the announcement in October 2009 by the Japanese National Body
                    that it has withdrawn its request for 2,621 rare ideographs (“gaiji” characters)
                        (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl5">Japan [National Body], “Follow-up on
                        N3530 (Compatibility Ideographs for Government Use)”, 2009</ref>), instead
                    opting to register them in the Ideographic Variation Database, a Unicode
                    Consortium-hosted registry of variation sequences that contain unified
                    ideographs (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl6">Unicode Consortium, "Ideographic
                        Variation Databse", 2009</ref>). The use of variation selectors is a
                    different approach than that advocated in the TEI P5 for “gaiji” characters
                        (<ref type="internal" cRef="bibl7">TEI P5 Guidelines: "5. Representation of
                        Non-standard Characters and Glyphs"</ref>), but is one that should be
                    mentioned in future <hi rend="italic">TEI Guidelines</hi> as an
                        alternative.<note>Variation selectors have also been mentioned as being used
                        to handle variants in other scripts, such as the historic script
                        Tangut.</note> In order to keep apprised of developments within the
                    standards groups, a liaison between TEI and the Unicode Consortium (and/or
                    ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2) would be advisable, as the activities of Unicode (/ISO) can
                    influence TEI recommendations.</p>
                <p>In sum, the process of character encoding is one that ultimately involves people
                    making decisions. Being aware of the interests and backgrounds of each standard
                    group and their members can help explain what appears to be a spotty set of
                    characters in Unicode. Keeping up-to-date on developments within the committees
                    can also provide insight into why a particular character is approved or not, or
                    why its progression has been slowed. The talk will conclude with suggestions on
                    how digital humanists can participate more actively and effectively in the
                    standards process.</p>
