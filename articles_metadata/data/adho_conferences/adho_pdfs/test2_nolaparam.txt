<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>index.html),  and  SIL’s  tools  (http://scripts.sil.org/Conversion) 
all  provide  samples  of  conversion  methods  for  upgrading 
digital projects to include new Unicode characters.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Since  Unicode  is  the  accepted  standard  for  character 
encoding,  any  critical  assessment  of  Unicode  made  to  the 
body in charge of Unicode, the Unicode Technical Committee, 
is generally limited to comments on whether a given character 
is  missing  in  Unicode  or--if  proposed  or  currently  included 
in  Unicode--critiques  of  a  character’s  glyph  and  name,  as 
well  as  its  line-breaking  properties  and  sorting  position. 
In  Chapter  5  of  the TEI  P5  Guidelines,  mention  is  made  of 
character  properties,  but  it  does  not  discuss  line-breaking 
or  sorting,  which  are  now  two  components  of  Unicode 
proposals and are discussed in annexes and standards on the 
Unicode Consortium website (Unicode Standard Annex #14 
“Line  Breaking  Properties,”  Unicode Technical  Standard  #10, 
“Unicode  Collation Algorithm,”  both  accessible  from  www.
unicode.org). Users should pay close attention to these two 
features, for an incorrect assignment can account for peculiar 
layout and sorting features in software. Comments on missing 
characters, incorrect glyphs or names, and properties should 
all  be  directed  to  the  Unicode  online  contact  page  (http://
www.unicode.org/reporting.html). It is recommended that an 
addition to Chapter 5 of P5 be made regarding word-breaking 
and collation when deﬁ ning new characters.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Unicode  Standard  will,  with  Unicode  5.1,  have  over 
100,000  characters  encoded,  and  proposals  are  underway 
for several unencoded historic and modern minority scripts, 
many  through  the  Script  Encoding  Initiative  at  UC  Berkeley 
(http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/alpha-script-list.html). 
Reviewing  the  glyphs,  names,  and  character  properties  for 
this  large  number  of  characters  is  difﬁ cult. Assistance  from 
the academic world is sought for (a) authoring and review of 
current proposals of unencoded character and scripts, and (b) 
prooﬁ ng the beta versions of Unicode. With the participation 
of digital humanists, this character encoding standard can be 
made a reliable and useful standard for such projects.

Digital Humanities Projects

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In theory, digital humanities projects should rely on standards 
for  text  and  character  encoding.  For  character  encoding, 
the standard recommended by TEI P5 (TEI Consortium, eds. 
Guidelines  for  Electronic  Text  Encoding  and  Interchange 
[last  modiﬁ ed:  03  Feb  2008],  http://www.tei-c.org/P5/)  is 
the  Unicode  Standard  (http://www.unicode.org/standard/
standard.html).  The  choices  made  by  digital  projects  in 
character encoding can be critical, as they impact text analysis 
and language processing, as well as the creation, storage, and 
retrieval of such textual digital resources. This talk will discuss 
new  characters  and  important  features  of  Unicode  5.0  and 
5.1 that could impact digital humanities projects, discuss the 
process of proposing characters into Unicode, and provide the 
theoretical underpinnings for acceptance of new characters by 
the standards committees. It will also give speciﬁ c case studies 
from  recent  Unicode  proposals  in  which  certain  characters 
were  not  accepted,  relaying  the  discussion  in  the  standards 
committees  on  why  they  were  not  approved.  This  latter 
topic is important, because decisions made by the standards 
committees ultimately will affect text encoding.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  those  characters  not  in  Unicode,  the  P5  version  of  the 
TEI Guidelines deftly describes what digital projects should do 
in Chapter 5 (TEI Consortium, eds. “Representation of Non-
standard  Characters  and  Glyphs,”  Guidelines  for  Electronic 
Text  Encoding  and  Interchange  [last  modiﬁ ed:  03  Feb 
2008],  http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/
WD.html  [accessed:  24  March  2008]),  but  one  needs  to  be 
aware of the new characters that are in the standards approval 
process. The presentation will brieﬂ y discuss where to go to 
look for the new characters on public websites, which are “in 
the pipeline.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  release  of  Unicode  5.0  in  July  2007  has  meant  that  an 
additional  1,369  new  characters  have  been  added  to  the 
standard, and Unicode 5.1, due to be released in April 2008, 
will  add  1,624  more 
(http://www.unicode.org/versions/
Unicode5.1.0/) In order to create projects that take advantage 
of what Unicode and Unicode-compliant software offers, one 
must  be  kept  abreast  of  developments  in  this  standard  and 
make appropriate changes to fonts and documents as needed. 
For projects involving medieval and historic texts, for example, 
the release of 5.1 will include a signiﬁ cant number of European 
medieval  letters,  as  well  as  new  Greek  and  Latin  epigraphic 
letters, editorial brackets and half-brackets, Coptic combining 
marks,  Roman  weights  and  measures  and  coin  symbols,  Old 
Cyrillic letters and Old Slavonic combining letters. The Menota

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Variation of Style: Diachronic 
Aspect  
 Vadim Andreev

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Among  works,  devoted  to  the  quantitative  study  of  style, 
an  approach  prevails  which  can  be  conventionally  called  as 
synchronic.  Synchronic  approach  is  aimed  at  solving  various 
classiﬁ cation problems (including those of attribution), making 
use of average (mean) values of characteristics, which reﬂ ect 
the  style  of  the  whole  creative  activity  of  an  author.  This 
approach is based on the assumption that the features of an 
individual style are not changing during lifetime or vary in time 
very  little,  due  to  which  the  changes  can  be  disregarded  as 
linguistically irrelevant. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Most  of  syntactic  characteristics  are  based  on  the  use  of 
traditional notions of the members of the sentence (subject, 
predicate, object, adverbial modiﬁ er) in the ﬁ rst and the ﬁ nal 
strong  positions  in  poems.  Other  syntactic  parameters  are 
the  number  of  clauses  in  (a)  complex  and  (b)  compound 
sentences. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There  are  also  several  characteristics  which  represent  what 
can  be  called  as  poetical  syntax.  They  are  the  number  of 
enjambements, the number of lines divided by syntactic pauses 
and  the  number  of  lines,  ending  in  exclamation  or  question 
marks. Enjambement takes place when a clause is continued 
on  the  next  line  (And  what  is  not  a  dream  by  day  / To  him 
whose eyes are cast / On things around him <…>). Pause is 
a break in a line, caused by a subordinate clause or another 
sentence (I feel ye now – I feel ye in your strength – <…>).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  values  of  the  characteristics,  which  were  obtained  as  a 
result of the analysis of lyrics, were normalised over the size 
of these texts in lines.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  assumption  can  be  tested  in  experiments,  organised 
within  a  diachronic  approach,  whose  purpose  is  to  compare 
linguistic  properties  of  texts,  written  by  the  same  author  at 
different periods of his life.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Method
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  paper  presents  the  results  of  such  a  diachronic  study 
of  the  individual  style  of  famous  American  romantic  poet 
E.A.Poe. The  study  was  aimed  at  ﬁ nding  out  whether  there 
were linguistically relevant differences in the style of the poet 
at various periods of his creative activity and if so, at revealing 
linguistic  markers  for  the  transition  from  one  period  to  the 
other.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Material
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The material includes iambic lyrics published by Poe in his 4 
collections of poems. Lyrics were chosen because this genre 
expresses in the most vivid way the essential characteristics of 
a poet. In order to achieve a common basis for the comparison 
only iambic texts were taken, they usually did not exceed 60 
lines. It should be noted that iamb was used by Poe in most of 
his verses. Sonnets were not taken for analysis because they 
possess  speciﬁ c  structural  organization.  Poe’s  life  is  divided 
into  three  periods:  (1)  from  Poe’s  ﬁ rst  attempts  to  write 
verses approximately in 1824 till 1829, (2) from 1830 till 1835 
and (3) from 1836 till 1849. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One  of  multivariate  methods  of  statistical  analyses  – 
discriminant  analysis  –  was  used.  This  method  has  been 
successfully used in the study of literary texts for authorship 
detection (Stamatatos, Fakatakis and Kokkinakis 2001; Baayen, 
Van  Halteren,  and Tweedie  1996,  etc.),  genre  differentiation 
(Karlgen,  Cutting  1994;  Minori  Murata  2000,  etc.),  gender 
categorization (Koppel et al. 2002; Olsen 2005), etc.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Discriminant analysis is a procedure whose purpose is to ﬁ nd 
characteristics,  discriminating  between  naturally  occurring 
(or  a  priori  formed)  classes,  and  to  classify  into  these 
classes separate (unique) cases which are often doubtful and 
“borderline”. For this purpose linear functions are calculated in 
such a way as to provide the best differentiation between the 
classes. The variables of these functions are characteristics of 
objects, relevant for discrimination. Judging by the coefﬁ cients 
of  these  variables  we  can  single  out  the  parameters  which 
possess maximum discriminating force. Besides, the procedure 
enables us to test the statistical signiﬁ cance of the obtained 
results (Klecka, 1989).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper discriminant analysis is used to ﬁ nd out if there is 
any difference between groups of texts written during Periods 
1–3, reveal characteristics differentiating these text groups and 
establish their discriminating force.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Characteristics
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  the  analysis  27  characteristics  were  taken. They  include 
morphological and syntactic parameters.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Results
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Morphological  characteristics  are  formulated  in  terms  of 
traditional  morphological  classes  (noun,  verb,  adjective, 
adverb  and  pronoun). We  counted  how  many  times  each  of 
them occurs in the ﬁ rst and the ﬁ nal strong (predominantly 
stressed) syllabic positions – ictuses.
_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It would be natural to expect that due to Poe’s relatively short 
period of creative activity (his ﬁ rst collection of poems was 
published in 1827, his last collection – in 1845) his individual style 
does not vary much, if at all. Nevertheless the results show that 
there are clearly marked linguistic differences between his texts 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On  the  whole  the  results  show  that  there  are  certain 
linguistic  features  which  reﬂ ect  the  changes  in  the  style  of 
E.A.Poe. Among important period markers are part of speech 
characteristics and several syntactic parameters.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>written during these three periods. Out of 27 characteristics, 
used in the analysis, 14 proved to possess discriminating force, 
distinguishing  between  the  verse  texts  of  different  periods 
of  the  author’s  life. The  strongest  discriminating  force  was 
observed  in  morphological  characteristics  of  words  both  in 
the ﬁ rst and ﬁ nal strong positions and syntactic characteristics 
of the initial part of verse lines. These parameters may be used 
for  automatic  classiﬁ cation  of  Poe’s  lyrics  into  three  groups 
corresponding  to  three  periods  of  his  creative  activity  with 
100% correctness. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The transition from the ﬁ rst to the second period is mainly 
characterised by changes in the number of verbs, nouns and 
pronouns in the ﬁ rst and the last strong positions, as well as 
in the number of subordinate clauses in complex sentences, 
words in the function of adverbial modiﬁ er in the initial position 
in the line. The development in Poe’s style from the second to 
the third period is also marked by changes in the number of 
morphological classes of words in the initial and ﬁ nal strong 
positions of the line (nouns, adverbs and pronouns). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It  should  be  stressed  that  these  changes  reﬂ ect  general 
tendencies of variation of frequencies of certain elements and 
are not present in all the texts. In the following examples the shift 
of verbs from the ﬁ nal part of the line, which is characteristic 
of the ﬁ rst period, to the initial strong position of the line (i.e. 
second syllable) in the second period is observed.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The US Government Photos and Graphics Collection include 
some  of  the  nation’s  most  precious  historical  documents. 
However  the  current 
for 
exploration. We  propose  an  architecture  that  enables  users 
to  collaboratively  construct  a  faceted  classiﬁ cation  for  this 
historical image collection, or any other large online multimedia 
collections.  We  have  implemented  a  prototype  for  the 
American Political History multimedia collection from usa.gov, 
with a collaborative faceted classiﬁ cation interface. In addition, 
the  proposed  architecture  includes  automated  document 
classiﬁ cation and facet schema enrichment techniques.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It is difﬁ cult to explore a large historical multimedia humanities 
collection  without  a  classiﬁ cation  scheme.  Legacy  items 
often  lack  textual  description  or  other  forms  of  metadata, 
which  makes  search  very  difﬁ cult.  One  common  approach 
is to have librarians classify the documents in the collection. 
This  approach  is  often  time  or  cost  prohibitive,  especially 
for  large,  growing  collections.    Furthermore,  the  librarian 
approach cannot reﬂ ect diverse and ever-changing needs and 
perspectives of users. As Sir Tim Berners-Lee commented: “the 
exciting thing [about Web] is serendipitous reuse of data: one 
person puts data up there for one thing, and another person 
uses it another way.” Recent social tagging systems such as del.
icio.us permit individuals to assign free-form keywords (tags) 
to  any  documents  in  a  collection.  In  other  words,  users  can 
contribute  metadata. These  tagging  systems,  however,  suffer 
from low quality of tags and lack of navigable structures.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  system  we  are  developing  improves  access  to  a  large 
multimedia  collection  by  supporting  users  collaboratively 
build  a  faceted  classiﬁ cation.  Such  a  collaborative  approach 
supports  diverse  and  evolving  user  needs  and  perspectives. 
Faceted  classiﬁ cation  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  for 
exploration and discovery in large collections [1]. Compared 
to search, it allows for recognition of category names instead 
of recalling of query keywords. Faceted classiﬁ cation consists 
of  two  components:  the  facet  schema  containing  facets  and 
categories, and the association between each document and 
the categories in the facet schema. Our system allows users to 
collaboratively 1) evolve a schema with facets and categories, 
and 2) to classify documents into this schema. Through users’ 
manual efforts and aided by the system’s automated efforts, a 
faceted classiﬁ cation evolves with the growing collection, the 
expanding user base, and the shifting user interests. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our fundamental belief is that a large, diverse group of people 
(students,  teachers,  etc.)  can  do  better  than  a  small  team 
of  librarians  in  classifying  and  enriching  a  large  multimedia 
collection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Related Research
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our  research  builds  upon  popular  wiki  and  social  tagging 
systems.  Below  we  discuss  several  research  projects  closest 
to ours in spirit.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Flamenco  project  [1]  has  developed  a  good  browsing 
interface based on faceted classiﬁ cation, and has gone through 
extensive evaluation with digital humanities collections such as 
the ﬁ ne art images at the museums in San Francisco. Flamenco, 
however,  is  a “read-only”  system. The  facet  schema  is  pre-
deﬁ ned, and the classiﬁ cation is pre-loaded. Users will not be 
able to change the way the documents are classiﬁ ed.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Facetag project [2] guides users’ tagging by presenting a 
predetermined facet schema to users. While users participate 
in classifying the documents, the predetermined facet schema 
forces  users  to  classify  the  documents  from  the  system’s 
perspective.  The  rigid  schema  is  insufﬁ cient  in  supporting 
diverse user perspectives. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  few  recent  projects  [4,  7]  attempt  to  create  classiﬁ cation 
schemas from tags collected from social tagging systems. So far 
these projects have generated only single hierarchies, instead 
of  multiple  hierarchies  as  in  faceted  schemas.  Also  just  as 
any other data mining systems, these automatic classiﬁ cation 
approaches suffers from quality problems. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>So  far,  no  one  has  combined  user  efforts  and  automated 
techniques to build a faceted classiﬁ cation, both to build the 
schema and to classify documents into it, in a collaborative and 
interactive manner.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>the collection. This collection is poor with metadata and tools, 
which  is  common  to  many  digital  humanity  collections  that 
contain legacy items that have little pre-existing metadata, or 
lack resources for maintenance.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Architecture and Prototype 
Implementation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  architecture  of  our  system  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  Users 
can  not  only  tag  (assign  free-form  keywords  to)  documents 
but also collaboratively build a faceted classiﬁ cation in a wiki 
fashion. Utilizing the metadata created by users’ tagging efforts 
and harvested from other sources, the system help improve 
the classiﬁ cation. We focus on three novel features: 1) to allow 
users collaboratively build and maintain a faceted classiﬁ cation, 
2) to systematically enrich the user-created facet schema, 3) 
to  automatically  classify  documents  into  the  evolving  facet 
schema. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 2. American Political History Collection at usa.gov
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  prototype  focused  on  the  collaborative  classiﬁ cation 
interface. After  deploying  our  prototype,  the  collection  has 
been  collaboratively  classiﬁ ed  into  categories  along  several 
facets.  To  prove  the  openness  of  system  architecture,  the 
prototype has been integrated with different existing systems. 
(Figure 3)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1. System Architecture
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  have  developed  a  Web-based  interface  that  allows 
users  create  and  edit  facets/categories  similar  to  managing 
directories  in  the  Microsoft  File  Explorer.  Simply  by  clicking 
and  dragging  documents  into  faceted  categories,  users  can 
classify  (or  re-classify)  historic  documents. All  the  ﬁ les  and 
documents are stored in a MySQL database.  For automatic 
classiﬁ cation,  we  use  a  support  vector  machine  method  [5] 
utilizing  users’  manual  classiﬁ cation  as  training  input.  For 
systematic facet enrichment, we are exploring methods that 
create new faceted categories from free-form tags based on a 
statistical co-occurrence model [6] and also WordNet [8]. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Note that the architecture has an open design so that it can 
be integrated with existing websites or content management 
systems. As such the system can be readily deployed to enrich 
existing digital humanity collections.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Initial  evaluation  results  in  a  controlled  environment  show 
great promise. The prototype was tested by university students 
interested  in American  political  history. The  collection  was 
collaboratively  categorized  into  facets  such  as Artifact  (map, 
photo,  etc.),  Location, Year,  and Topics  (Buildings,  Presidents, 
etc.) The  prototype  is  found  to  be  more  effective  than  the 
original website in supporting user’s retrieval tasks, in terms 
of both recall and precision. At this time, our prototype does 
not have all the necessary support to be deployed on public 
Internet for a large number of users. For this we need to work 
on the concept of hardening a newly added category or facet. 
The key idea behind hardening is to accept a new category or

the  number  of  new  facets  and  categories.       We  are  also

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Facsimile  images  form  a  major  component  in  many  digital 
editing  projects.  Well-known  projects  such  as  the  Blake 
Archive [Eaves 2007] and the Rossetti Archive [McGann 2007] 
use facsimile images as the primary entry point to accessing 
the  visually  rich  texts  in  their  collections.  Even  for  projects 
focused on transcribed electronic editions, it is now standard 
practice to include high-resolution facsimile. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Encoding  standards  and  text  processing  toolkits  have  been 
the focus of signiﬁ cant research. Tools, standards, and formal 
models for encoding information in image-based editions have 
only  recently  begun  to  receive  attention.  Most  work  in  this 
area has centered on the digitization and presentation of visual 
materials  [Viscomi  2002]  or  detailed  markup  and  encoding 
of information within a single image [Lecolinet 2002, Kiernan 
2004, Dekhtyar 2006]. Comparatively little has been work has 
been done on modeling the large-scale structure of facsimile 
editions. Typically, the reading interface that presents a facsimile 
determines its structure. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Separating  the  software  used  to  model  data  from  that  used 
to build user interfaces has well-known advantages for both 
engineering  and  digital  humanities  practices. To  achieve  this 
separation,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  a  model  of  a  facsimile 
edition  that  is  independent  of  the  interface  used  to  present 
that edition.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper, we present a uniﬁ ed approach for representing 
linguistic,  structural,  and  graphical  content  of  a  text  as  an 
Annotated Facsimile Edition (AFED). This model grows out of 
our experience with several digital facsimile edition projects 
over  more  than  a  decade,  including  the  Cervantes  Project 
[Furuta  2001],  the  Digital  Donne  [Monroy  2007a],  and  the 
Nautical Archaeology Digital Library [Monroy 2007b]. Our work 
on  these  projects  has  emphasized  the  need  for  an  intuitive 
conceptual  model  of  a  digital  facsimile. This  model  can  then 
serve  as  the  basis  for  a  core  software  module  that  can  be 
used across projects without requiring extensive modiﬁ cation 
by software developers. Drawing on our prior work we have 
distilled ﬁ ve primary goals for such a model:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Openness: Scholars’ focused research needs are highly 
speciﬁ c, vary widely between disciplines, and change over 
time. The model must accommodate new information needs 
as they arise.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>notes. While it is natural to treat facsimile images sequentially, 
any particular linear sequence represents an implementation 
decision—a  decision  that  may  not  be  implied  by  the 
physical  document.  For  example,  an  editor  may  choose  to 
arrange  an  edition  of  letters  according  to  the  date  written, 
recipient,  or  thematic  content. The  image  stream,  therefore, 
is an implementation detail of the model. The structure of the 
edition is speciﬁ ed explicitly by the annotations.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Non-hierarchical: Facsimile editions contain some 
information that should be presented hierarchically, but 
they cannot be adequately represented as a single, properly 
nested hierarchy. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Restructuring: A facsimile is a representation of the 
physical form of a document, but the model should enable 
applications to restructure the original form to meet 
speciﬁ c needs. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Alignment: Comparison between varying representations 
of the same work is a fundamental task of humanities 
research. The model must support alignment between 
facsimiles of different copies of a work. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Annotated Facsimile Editions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Table 1: Information represented by an annotation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Annotated  Facsimile  Edition  (AFED)  models  the  macro 
level  structure  of  facsimile  editions,  representing  them  as  a 
stream of images with annotations over that stream. Figure 1 
shows  a  simpliﬁ ed  diagram  illustrating  a  two-volume  edition 
of collected poems. Annotations encode the structure of the 
document  and  properties  of  the  structural  elements  they 
represent.  Separate  annotation  streams  encode  multiple 
analytical perspectives. For example, in ﬁ gure 1, the annotations 
shown below the image stream describe the physical structure 
of the edition (volumes, pages, and lines) while the annotations 
shown above the image stream describe the poetic structure 
(poems,  titles,  epigraphs,  stanzas).  Annotations  within  a 
single  analytical  perspective—but  not  those  from  different 
perspectives—follow a hierarchical structure. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Many historical texts exist only as fragments. Many more have 
suffered  damage  that  results  in  the  lost  of  a  portion  of  the 
original  text.  Despite  this  damage,  the  general  content  and 
characteristics of the text may be known or hypothesized based 
on other sources. In other cases, while the original artifact may 
exist, a digital representation of all or part of the artifact may 
unavailable initially. To enable scholars to work with missing or 
unavailable portions of a facsimile, we introduce the notion of 
an abstract image. An abstract image is simply a placeholder 
for a known or hypothesized artifact of the text for which no 
image is available. Annotations attach to abstract images in the 
same way they attach to existing images. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Annotations
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Image Stream
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  image  stream  intuitively  corresponds  to  the  sequential 
ordering of page images in a traditional printed book. These 
images, however, need not represent actual “pages.” An image 
might  show  a  variety  of  artifacts  including  an  opening  of  a 
book, a fragment of a scroll, or an unbound leaf of manuscript 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Annotations are the primary means for representing structural 
and linguistic content in the AFED. An annotation identiﬁ es a 
range of images and speciﬁ es properties about those images. 
Table  1  lists  the  information  speciﬁ ed  by  each  annotation. 
Properties  in  italics  are  optional.  As  shown  in  this  table, 
annotations  support  three  main  categories  of  information: 
annotation management, content, and structural information. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  annotation  management  and  structural  information 
categories  contain  record  keeping  information.  Structural 
information describes the hierarchical structure of annotation 
within an analytical perspective. The annotation management 
category speciﬁ es the annotation type and identiﬁ es the image 
content referenced by the annotation. The sequence number is 
an identiﬁ er used by AFED to determine the relative ordering 
of  multiple  annotations  that  have  the  same  starting  index. 
AFED is agnostic to the precise semantics of this value. The 
annotation  type  determines  these  semantics.  For  example, 
a  paragraph  annotation  may  refer  to  the  paragraph  number 
relative to a page, chapter, or other structural unit.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  content  category  describes  the  item  referenced  by  the 
annotation. Annotations support two naming conventions. To 
facilitate comparison between documents, an annotation may 
specify a canonical name according to a domain speciﬁ c naming 
convention. Canonical names usually do not match the name 
given to the referenced item by the artifact itself and are rarely 
appropriate for display to a general audience. Accordingly, the 
annotation  requires  the  speciﬁ cation  of  a  name  suitable  for 
display. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Descriptive  metadata  can  be  speciﬁ ed  as  a  set  of  key/value 
properties.  In  addition  to  descriptive  metadata,  annotations 
support multiple transcriptions. Multiple transcriptions allow 
alternate perspectives of the text; for example, a paleographic 
transcription  to  support  detailed  linguistic  analysis  and  a 
normalized  transcription  to  facilitate  reading. Transcriptions 
may also include translations. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>AFED’s annotation mechanism deﬁ nes a high-level syntactical 
structure  that  is  sufﬁ cient  to  support  the  basic  navigational 
needs  of  most  facsimile  projects.  By  remaining  agnostic 
to  semantic  details,  it  allows  for  ﬂ exible,  project  speciﬁ c 
customization.  Where  projects  need  to  support  user 
interactions that go beyond typical navigation scenarios, these 
interactions can be integrated into the user interface without 
requiring changes to the lower-level tools used to access the 
facsimile.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Discussion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>AFED has proven to be a useful model in our work. We have 
deployed  a  proof  of  concept  prototype  based  on  the AFED 
model.  Several  of  the  facsimile  editions  constructed  by  the 
Cervantes Project use this prototype behind the scenes. Given its 
success in these reader’s interfaces, we are working to develop 
a Web-based editing toolkit. This application will allow editors 
to  quickly  deﬁ ne  annotations  and  use  those  annotations  to 
describe a facsimile edition. We anticipate completing this tool 
by the summer of 2008.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By  using  multiple,  hierarchical  annotation  streams,  AFED’s 
expressive  power  falls  under  the  well-studied  class  of 
document  models,  known  as  OHCO  (ordered  hierarchy  of 
content objects). Speciﬁ cally, it is an instance of a revised form 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>of  this  generic  model  known  as  OHCO-3,  [Renear  1996]. 
Whereas  most  prior  research  and  development  associated 
with the OHCO model has focused on XML-based, transcribed 
content, we have applied this model to the task of representing 
macro-level structures in facsimile editions. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Focusing on macro-level document structure partially isolates 
the AFED model from the non-hierarchical nature of documents 
both in terms of the complexity of the required data structures, 
and in terms of providing simpliﬁ ed model to facilitate system 
implementation.  If  warranted  by  future  applications,  we  can 
relax AFED’s  hierarchical  constraint.  Relaxing  this  constraint 
poses  no  problems  with  the  current  prototype;  however, 
further investigation is needed to determine potential beneﬁ ts 
and drawbacks.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  addition  to  macro-level  structures,  a  document  model 
that  strives  to  represent  the  visual  content  of  a  document 
for  scholarly  purposes  must  also  account  for  ﬁ ne-grained 
structures  present  in  individual  images  and  provide  support 
for  encoded  content  at  a  higher  level  of  detail. We  envision 
using the AFED model in conjunction with models tailored for 
these low-level structures. We are working to develop a model 
for  representing  ﬁ ne-grained  structure  in  visually  complex 
documents grounded in spatial hypermedia theory.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  paper,  we  present  a Web-based  interface  for  editing 
visually  complex  documents,  such  as  modern  authorial 
manuscripts. Applying spatial hypertext theory as the basis for 
designing this interface enables us to facilitate both interaction 
with the visually complex structure of these documents and 
integration of heterogeneous sources of external information. 
This  represents  a  new  paradigm  for  designing  systems  to 
support digital textual studies. Our approach emphasizes the 
visual nature of texts and provides powerful tools to support 
interpretation and creativity. In contrast to purely image-based 
systems, we are able to do this while retaining the beneﬁ ts of 
traditional textual analysis tools. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Documents express information as a combination of written 
words,  graphical  elements,  and  the  arrangement  of  these 
content objects in a particular media. Digital representations of 
documents—and the applications built around them—typically 
divide information between primarily textual representations 
on the one hand (e.g., XML encoded documents) and primarily 
graphical based representations on the other (e.g., facsimiles). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Image-based  representations  allow  readers  access  to  high-
quality facsimiles of the original document, but provide little 
support for explicitly encoded knowledge about the document. 
XML-based  representations,  by  contrast,  are  able  to  specify 
detailed semantic knowledge embodied by encoding guidelines 
such  as  the TEI  [Sperberg-McQueen  2003]. This  knowledge 
forms  the  basis  for  building  sophisticated  analysis  tools  and 
developing  rich  hypertext  interfaces  to  large  document 
collections and supporting materials. This added power comes 
at a price. These approaches are limited by the need to specify 
all relevant content explicitly. This is, at best, a time consuming 
and expensive task and, at worst, an impossible one [Robinson 
2000]. Furthermore, in typical systems, access to these texts 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
50
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>mediated  almost  exclusively  by  the  transcribed  linguistic 
content, even when images alongside their transcriptions. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>System Design
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  are  developing  CritSpace  as  a  proof  of  concept  system 
using the spatial hypertext metaphor as a basis for supporting 
digital textual studies. Building this system from scratch, rather 
than  using  an  existing  application,  allows  us  to  tailor  the 
design to meet needs speciﬁ c to the textual studies domain 
(for example, by including document image analysis tools). We 
are  also  able  to  develop  this  application  with  a Web-based 
interface  tightly  integrated  with  a  digital  archive  containing 
a  large  volume  of  supporting  information  (such  as  artwork, 
biographical information, and bibliographic references) as well 
as the primary documents. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Initially, our focus is on a collection of manuscript documents 
written by Picasso [Audenaert 2007]. Picasso’s prominent use 
of  visual  elements,  their  tight  integration  with  the  linguistic 
content, and his reliance on ambiguity and spatial arrangement 
to convey meaning make this collection particularly attractive 
[Marin 1993, Michaël 2002]. These features also make his work 
particularly difﬁ cult to represent using XML-based approaches. 
More importantly, Picasso’s writings contain numerous features 
that exemplify the broader category of modern manuscripts 
including  documents  in  multiple  states,  extensive  authorial 
revisions, editorial drafts, interlinear and marginal scholia, and 
sketches and doodles. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>in  XML-based 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By adopting spatial hypertext as a metaphor for representing 
document  structure,  we  are  able  to  design  a  system  that 
emphasizes  the  visually  construed  contents  of  a  document 
while  retaining  access  to  structured  semantic  information 
embodied 
representations.  Dominant 
hypertext  systems,  such  as  the  Web,  express  document 
relationships  via  explicit  links.  In  contrast,  spatial  hypertext 
expresses relationships by placing related content nodes near 
each  other  on  a  two-dimensional  canvas  [Marshall  1993].  In 
addition to spatial proximity, spatial hypertext systems express 
relationships  through  visual  properties  such  as  background 
color, border color and style, shape, and font style. Common 
features of spatial hypermedia systems include parsers capable 
of  recognizing  relationships  between  objects  such  as  lists, 
list  headings,  and  stacks,  structured  metadata  attributes  for 
objects,  search  capability,  navigational  linking,  and  the  ability 
to follow the evolution of the information space via a history 
mechanism.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  spatial  hypertext  model  has  an  intuitive  appeal  for 
representing  visually  complex  documents. According  to  this 
model,  documents  specify  relationships  between  content 
objects (visual representations of words and graphical elements) 
based on their spatial proximity and visual similarity. This allows 
expression of informal, implicit, and ambiguous relationships—
a  key  requirement  for  humanities  scholarship.  Unlike  purely 
image-based  representations,  spatial  hypertext  enables  users 
to add formal descriptions of content objects and document 
structure  incrementally  in  the  form  of  structured  metadata 
(including  transcriptions  and  markup).  Hypermedia  theorists 
refer  to  this  process  as  “incremental  formalism”  [Shipman 
1999]. Once added, these formal descriptions facilitate system 
support for text analysis and navigational hypertext. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Another  key  advantage  of  spatial  hypertext  is  its  ability  to 
support  “information  triage”  [Marshall  1997].  Information 
triage is the process of locating, organizing, and prioritizing large 
amounts  of  heterogeneous  information.  This  is  particularly 
helpful in supporting information analysis and decision making 
in situations where the volume of information available makes 
detailed evaluation of it each resource impossible. By allowing 
users  to  rearrange  objects  freely  in  a  two-dimensional 
workspace,  spatial  hypertext  systems  provide  a  lightweight 
interface  for  organizing  large  amounts  of  information.  In 
addition  to  content  taken  directly  from  document  images, 
this  model  encourages  the  inclusion  of  visual  surrogates  for 
information  drawn  from  numerous  sources.  These  include 
related photographs and artwork, editorial annotations, links 
to related documents, and bibliographical references. Editors/
readers can then arrange this related material as they interact 
with  the  document  to  reﬁ ne  their  interpretive  perspective. 
Editors/readers are also able to supply their own notes and 
graphical annotations to enrich the workspace further. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1: Screenshot of CritSpace showing a document 
along with several related preparatory sketches 
Picasso made for Guernica about the same time.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>CritSpace provides an HTML based interface for accessing the 
collection maintained by the Picasso Project [Mallen 2007] that 
contains  nearly  14,000  artworks  (including  documents)  and 
9,500 biographical entries. CritSpace allows users to arrange 
facsimile  document  images  in  a  two  dimensional  workspace 
and  resize  and  crop  these  images.  Users  may  also  search 
and browse the entire holdings of the digital library directly 
from  CritSpace,  adding  related  artworks  and  biographical 
information to the workspace as desired. In addition to content 
taken  from  the  digital  library,  users  may  add  links  to  other 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>material available on the Web, or add their own comments to 
the workspace in the form of annotations. All of these items 
are displayed as content nodes that can be freely positioned 
and whose visual properties can be modiﬁ ed. Figure 1 shows 
a screenshot of this application that displays a document and 
several related artworks.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While  spatial  hypertext  provides  a  powerful  model  for 
representing  a  single  workspace,  textual  scholars  will  need 
tools to support the higher-level structure found in documents, 
such  as  chapters,  sections,  books,  volumes.  Further  work  is 
needed  to  identify  ways  in  which  existing  spatial  hypertext 
models can be extended express relationships between these 
structures and support navigation, visualization, and editing.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>CritSpace also introduces several features tailored to support 
digital textual studies. A tab at the bottom of the display opens 
a window containing a transcription of the currently selected 
item. An accordion-style menu on the right hand side provides 
a clipboard for temporarily storing content while rearranging 
the workspace, an area for working with groups of images, and 
a  panel  for  displaying  metadata  and  browsing  the  collection 
based  on  this  metadata. We  also  introduce  a  full  document 
mode  that  allows  users  to  view  a  high-resolution  facsimile. 
This  interface  allows  users  to  add  annotations  (both  shapes 
and  text)  to  the  image  and  provides  a  zooming  interface  to 
facilitate close examination of details. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Future Work
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>CritSpace provides a solid foundation for understanding how 
to apply spatial hypertext as a metaphor for interacting with 
visually complex documents. This perspective opens numerous 
directions for further research. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  key  challenge  is  developing  tools  to  help  identify  content 
objects within a document and then to extracted these object 
in a way that will allow users to manipulate them in the visual 
workspace. Along these lines, we are working to adapt existing 
techniques  for  foreground/background  segmentation  [Gatos 
2004],  word  and  line  identiﬁ cation  [Manmatha  2005],  and 
page  segmentation  [Shafait  2006]. We  are  investigating  the 
use of Markov chains to align transcriptions to images semi-
automatically [Rothfeder 2006] and expectation maximization 
to automatically recognize dominant colors for the purpose of 
separating information layers (for example, corrections made 
in red ink). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Current  implementations  of  these  tools  require  extensive 
parameter tuning by individuals with a detailed understanding 
of  the  image  processing  algorithms. We  plan  to  investigate 
interfaces  that  will  allow  non-experts  to  perform  this 
parameter tuning interactively. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Modern spatial hypertext applications include a representation 
of  the  history  of  the  workspace  [Shipman  2001].  We  are 
interested in incorporating this notion, to represent documents, 
not  as  ﬁ xed  and  ﬁ nal  objects,  but  rather  objects  that  have 
changed over time. This history mechanism will enable editors 
to  reconstruct  hypothetical  changes  to  the  document  as 
authors and annotators have modiﬁ ed it. It can also be used to 
allowing readers to see the changes made by an editor while 
constructing a particular form of the document.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Discussion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Spatial  hypertext  offers  an  alternative  to  the  dominate 
view  of  text  as  an “ordered  hierarchy  of  content  objects” 
(OCHO) [DeRose 1990]. The OCHO model emphasizes the 
linear,  linguistic  content  of  a  document  and  requires  explicit 
formalization  of  structural  and  semantic  relationships  early 
in  the  encoding  process.  For  documents  characterized  by 
visually  constructed  information  or  complex  and  ambiguous 
structures, OCHO may be overly restrictive. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  these  cases,  the  ability  to  represent  content  objects 
graphically in a two dimensional space provides scholars the 
ﬂ exibility to represent both the visual aspects of the text they 
are  studying  and  the  ambiguous,  multi-facetted  relationships 
found in those texts. Furthermore, by including an incremental 
path toward the explicit encoding of document content, this 
model enables the incorporation of advanced textual analysis 
tools that can leverage both the formally speciﬁ ed structure 
and the spatial arrangement of the content objects.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  paper  demonstrates  a  web-based,  interactive  data 
visualisation, allowing users to quickly inspect and browse the 
collocational relationships present in a corpus. The software is 
inspired by tag clouds, ﬁ rst popularised by on-line photograph 
sharing  website  Flickr  (www.ﬂ ickr.com).  A  paper  based  on 
a  prototype  of  this  Collocate  Cloud  visualisation  was  given 
at  Digital  Resources  for  the  Humanities  and Arts  2007. The 
software  has  since  matured,  offering  new  ways  of  navigating 
and inspecting the source data. It has also been expanded to 
analyse additional corpora, such as the British National Corpus 
(http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/), which will be the focus of this 
talk.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Tag clouds allow the user to browse, rather than search for 
speciﬁ c pieces of information. Flickr encourages its users to 
add  tags  (keywords)  to  each  photograph  uploaded. The  tags 
associated with each individual photograph are aggregated; the 
most frequent go on to make the cloud. The cloud consists of 
these tags presented in alphabetical order, with their frequency 
displayed as variation in colour, or more commonly font size. 
Figure 1 is an example of the most popular tags at Flickr:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  cloud  offers  two  ways  to  access  the  information.  If  the 
user  is  looking  for  a  speciﬁ c  term,  the  alphabetical  ordering 
of the information allows it to be quickly located if present. 
More importantly, as a tool for browsing, frequent tags stand 
out  visually,  giving  the  user  an  immediate  overview  of  the 
data. Clicking on a tag name will display all photographs which 
contain that tag.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The cloud-based visualisation has been successfully applied to 
language. McMaster University’s TAPoR Tools (http://taporware.
mcmaster.ca/)  features  a ‘Word  Cloud’  module,  currently  in 
beta  testing. WMatrix  (http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/)  can 
compare  two  corpora  by  showing  log-likelihood  results  in 
cloud  form.  In  addition  to  other  linguistic  metrics,  internet 
book seller Amazon provides a word cloud, see ﬁ gure 2.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 3. British National Corpus through interface developed 
by Mark Davies, searching for ‘bank’, showing collocates
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/ (accessed 23 November 2007)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The data contained in the table lends itself to visualisation as 
a cloud. As with the word cloud, the list of collocates can be 
displayed  alphabetically.  Co-occurrence  frequency,  like  word 
frequency, can be mapped to font size. This would produce an 
output visually similar to the word cloud. Instead of showing 
all corpus words, they would be limited to those surrounding 
the chosen node word.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Another valuable statistic obtainable via collocates is that of 
collocational strength, the likelihood of two words co-occurring, 
measured  here  by  MI  (Mutual  Information). Accounting  for 
this  extra  dimension  requires  an  additional  visual  cue  to  be 
introduced, one which can convey the continuous data of an MI 
score. This can be solved by varying the colour, or brightness 
of the collocates forming the cloud. The end result is shown 
in ﬁ gure 4:

1#concordance (accessed 23 November 2007)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this instance a word frequency list is the data source, showing 
the most frequent 100 words. As with the tag cloud, this list 
is alphabetically ordered, the font size being proportionate to 
its frequency of usage. It has all the beneﬁ ts of a tag cloud; in 
this instance clicking on a word will produce a concordance 
of that term.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  method  of  visualisation  and  interaction  offers  another 
tool  for  corpus  linguists. As  developer  for  an  online  corpus 
project,  I  have  found  that  the  usability  and  sophistication  of 
our  tools  have  been  important  to  our  success.  Cloud-like 
displays of information would complement our other advanced 
features,  such  as  geographic  mapping  and  transcription 
synchronisation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  word  clouds  produced  by TAPoR Tools, WMatrix  and 
Amazon  are,  for  browsing,  an  improvement  over  tabular 
statistical  information.  There  is  an  opportunity  for  other 
corpus data to be enhanced by using a cloud. Linguists often 
use  collocational  information  as  a  tool  to  examine  language 
use. Figure 3 demonstrates a typical corpus tool output:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 4. Demonstration of collocate 
cloud, showing node word ‘bank’
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The collocate cloud inherits all the advantages of previous cloud 
visualisations: a collocate, if known, can be quickly located due 
to the alphabetical nature of the display. Frequently occurring 
collocates stand out, as they are shown in a larger typeface, 
with collocationally strong pairings highlighted using brighter 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
54
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>formatting. Therefore bright, large collocates are likely to be 
of  interest,  whereas  dark,  small  collocates  perhaps  less  so. 
Hovering  the  mouse  over  a  collocate  will  display  statistical 
information,  co-occurrence  frequency  and  MI  score,  as  one 
would ﬁ nd from the tabular view.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  use  of  collocational  data  also  presents  additional 
possibilities  for  interaction. A  collocate  can  be  clicked  upon 
to  produce  a  new  cloud,  with  the  previous  collocate  as  the 
new  node  word. This  gives  endless  possibilities  for  corpus 
exploration  and  the  investigation  of  different  domains. 
Occurrences  of  polysemy  can  be  identiﬁ ed  and  expanded 
upon by following the different collocates. Particular instances 
of usage are traditionally hidden from the user when viewing 
aggregated data, such as the collocate cloud. The solution is to 
allow the user to examine the underlying data by producing 
an  optional  concordance  for  each  node/collocate  pairing 
present. Additionally a KWIC concordance can be generated 
by  examining  the  node  word,  visualising  the  collocational 
strength of the surrounding words. These concordance lines 
can even by reordered on the basis of collocational strength, 
in  addition  to  the  more  traditional  options  of  preceding  or 
succeeding words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This visualisation may be appealing to members of the public, 
or  those  seeking  a  more  practical  introduction  to  corpus 
linguistics. In teaching use they not only provide analysis, but 
from user feedback, also act as stimulation in creative writing. 
Collocate searches across different corpora or document sets 
may be visualised side by side, facilitating quick identiﬁ cation 
of differences.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While the collocate cloud is not a substitute for raw data, it 
does provide a fast and convenient way to navigate language. 
The  ability  to  generate  new  clouds  from  existing  collocates 
extends this further. Both this iterative nature and the addition 
of  collocational  strength  information  gives  these  collocate 
clouds greater value for linguistic research than previous cloud 
visualisations.

old Dutch urban designs and 
maps.  A computer assisted

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  Historical manuscripts and printed maps of the pre-cadastral1 
period  show  enormous  differences  in  scale,  precision  and 
color. Less apparent are differences in reliability between maps, 
or  between  different  parts  of  the  same  map. True,  modern 
techniques in computer assisted cartography make it possible 
to  measure  very  accurately  such  differences  between  maps 
and geographic space with very distinct levels of precision and 
accuracy. However differences in reliability between maps, or 
between different parts of the same map, are not only due to 
the accuracy measurement techniques, but also to their original 
function and context of (re-)use. Historical information about 
the  original  context  of  function  and  context  of  (re-)use  can 
give us insight how to measure accuracy, how to choose the 
right points for geo-referencing and how to rectify digital maps. 
On  the  other  hand  computer  assisted  cartography  enables 
us  to  trace  and  to  visualize  important  information  about 
mapmaking,  especially  when  further  historical  evidence  is 
missing, is hidden or is distorted, consciously or unconsciously. 
The  proposed  paper  is  embedded  in  the  project:  Paper  and 
Virtual Cities, (subsidized by the Netherlands Organization for 
Scientiﬁ c  Research)  that  aims  at  developing  methodologies 
that a) permit researchers to use historical maps and related 
sources more accurately in creating in digital maps and virtual 
reconstructions  of  cities  and  b)  allow  users  to  recognize 
better technical manipulations and distortions of truth used in 
the process of mapmaking.2
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper we present as one of the outcomes of this project 
a  method  that  visualizes  different  levels  of  accuracy  in  and 
between designs and maps in relation to their original function 
to assess their quality for re-use today. This method is presented 
by  analyzing  different  17th  century  designs,  manuscript  and 
engraved maps of the city of Leiden, in particular of the land 
surveyor, mapmaker Jan Pietersz. Dou. The choice for Leiden 
and Dou is no coincidence.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One of the reasons behind differences the accuracy of maps is 
the enormous variety in methods and measures used in land 
surveying and mapmaking in the Low Countries.3 This variety 
was  the  result  of  differences  in  the  private  training  and  the 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
55
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>backgrounds  of  the  surveyors,  in  the  use  of  local  measures 
and  in  the  exam  procedures  that  differed  from  province  to 
province.4 These differences would last until the 19th Century. 
However, already by the end of the 16th Century we see in and 
around  Leiden  the  ﬁ rst  signs  of  standardization  in  surveying 
techniques and the use of measures.5 First of all, the Rhineland 
rod  (3.767  meter)  the  standard  of  the  water-administration 
body  around  Leiden  is  used  more  and  more,  along  local 
measures  in  the  Low  Countries  and  in  Dutch  expansion 
overseas. A second reason to look at Leiden in more detail is 
that in 1600 a practical training school in land surveying and 
fortiﬁ cation would be founded in the buildings of its university, 
the so-called Duytsche Mathematique, that turned out to be 
very  successful  not  only  in  the  Low  Countries,  but  also  in 
other  European  countries. This  not  only  contributed  to  the 
spread  and  reception  of  the  Rhineland  rod,  but  also  to  the 
dissemination  of  more  standardized  ways  of  land  surveying 
and fortiﬁ cation.6 The instructional material of the professors 
of  this  training  school  and  the  notes  of  their  pupils  are  still 
preserved, which allows us to study the process of surveying 
and mapmaking in more detail. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The reason to look into the work of Jan Pietersz. Dou is his 
enormous production of maps. Westra (1994) calculated that 
at least 1150 maps still exist.7 Of the object of our case study 
alone,  the  city  of  Leiden,  Dou  produced  at  least  120  maps 
between 1600 and 1635, ranging from property maps, designs 
for  extensions  of  the  city  and  studies  for  civil  engineering 
works etc. We will focus on the maps that Dou made for the 
urban  extension  of  the  city  of  Leiden  of  1611.    Sometimes 
these (partial) maps were made for a speciﬁ c purpose; in other 
cases Dou tried in comprehensive maps, combining property 
estimates  and  future  designs,  to  tackle  problems  of  illegal 
economic activities, pollution, housing and fortiﬁ cation. Since 
these measurements were taken in his ofﬁ cial role of, sworn-in 
land surveyor we can assume that they were supposed to be 
accurate. This variety in designs and maps for the same area 
allows us to discuss accuracy in relation to function and (re-
)use of maps. We will also explain that the differences between 
designs and maps require different methods of geo-referencing 
and analysis.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In particular, we will give attention to one design map of Dou 
for  the  northern  part  of  the  city  of  Leiden  RAL  PV  1002-
06 (Regionaal Archief Leiden) to show how misinterpretation 
of  features  lead  to  unreliable  or  biased  decisions  when  the 
historical  context  is  not  taken  into  account,  even  when  we 
can  consider  the  results,  in  terms  of  accuracy,  satisfactory. 
Since  Dou  later  also  made  maps  for  commercial  purposes 
of the same northern extension of Leiden it is interesting to 
compare these maps. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusions  are  drawn  addressing  the  question  of  whether 
Dou used the same measurements to produce a commercial 
map  or  that  he  settled  for  less  accuracy  given  the  different 
purpose  of  the  later  map  compared  to  his  designs  and 
property maps. To answer this question, we use modern digital 
techniques  of  geo-processing8  to  compare  the  old  maps  to 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>modern  cartographical  resources  and  to  the  cadastral  map 
of the 1800s in order to determine how accurate the various 
maps  in  question  are.  We  do  this,  by  using  the  American 
National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) to deﬁ ne 
accuracy at a 95% conﬁ dence level. By point-based analysis we 
link distributional errors to classiﬁ ed features in order to ﬁ nd 
a relationship between accuracy and map function.9
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Notes
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(1) Cadastral mapping refers to the “mapping of property 
boundaries, particularly to record the limitation of title or 
for the assessment of taxation”. The term “cadastral” is also

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  paper  two  highly  innovative  digital  editions  will  be 
presented. The digital editions of the historical literary journals 
“Die  Fackel”  (published  by  Karl  Kraus  in Vienna  from  1899 
to  1936)  and “Der  Brenner”  (published  by  Ludwig  Ficker  in 
Innsbruck from 1910 to 1954) have been developed within the 
corpus research framework of the “AAC - Austrian Academy 
Corpus” at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in collaboration 
with  other  researchers  and  programmers  in  the AAC  from 
Vienna together with the graphic designer Anne Burdick from 
Los Angeles. For the creation of these scholarly digital editions 
the AAC  edition  philosophy  and  principles  have  been  made 
use  of  whereby  new  corpus  research  methods  have  been 
applied for questions of computational philology and textual 
studies in a digital environment. The examples of these online 
editions will give insights into the potentials and the beneﬁ ts 
of making corpus research methods and techniques available 
for scholarly research into language and literature.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The “AAC - Austrian Academy Corpus” is a corpus research 
unit  at  the  Austrian  Academy  of  Sciences  concerned  with 
establishing  and  exploring  large  electronic  text  corpora  and 
with conducting scholarly research in the ﬁ eld of corpora and 
digital text collections and editions. The texts integrated into 
the AAC are predominantly German language texts of historical 
and cultural signiﬁ cance from the last 150 years. The AAC has 
collected thousands of texts from various authors, representing 
many different text types from all over the German speaking 
world. Among the sources, which systematically cover various 
domains,  genres  and  types,  are  newspapers,  literary  journals, 
novels,  dramas,  poems,  advertisements,  essays  on  various 
subjects,  travel  literature,  cookbooks,  pamphlets,  political 
speeches as well as a variety of scientiﬁ c, legal, and religious 
texts, to name just a few forms. The AAC provides resources 
for investigations into the linguistic and textual properties of 
these texts and into their historical and cultural qualities. More 
than  350  million  running  words  of  text  have  been  scanned, 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>digitized,  integrated  and  annotated. The  selection  of  texts  is 
made according to the AAC’s principles of text selection that 
are  determined  by  speciﬁ c  research  interests  as  well  as  by 
systematic  historical,  empirical  and  typological  parameters. 
The  annotation  schemes  of  the  AAC,  based  upon  XML 
related standards, have in the phase of corpus build-up been 
concerned  with  the  application  of  basic  structural  mark-up 
and selective thematic annotations. In the phase of application 
development  speciﬁ c  thematic  annotations  are  being  made 
exploring questions of linguistic and textual scholarly research 
as well as experimental and exploratory mark-up. Journals are 
regarded as interesting sources for corpus research because 
they comprise a great variety of text types over a long period 
of time. Therefore, model digital editions of literary journals 
have been developed: The AAC-FACKEL was published on 1 
January  2007  and  BRENNER  ONLINE  followed  in  October 
2007.  The  basic  elements  and  features  of  our  approach 
of  corpus  research  in  the  ﬁ eld  of  textual  studies  will    be 
demonstrated in this paper.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>AAC-FACKEL
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>source for the history of the time, for its language and its moral 
transgressions. Karl Kraus covers in a typical and idiosyncratic 
style  in  thousands  of  texts  the  themes  of  journalism  and 
war,  of  politics  and  corruption,  of  literature  and  lying.  His 
inﬂ uential  journal  comprises  a  great  variety  of  essays,  notes, 
commentaries,  aphorisms  and  poems.  The  electronic  text, 
also  used  for  the  compilation  of  a  text-dictionary  of  idioms 
(“Wörterbuch der Redensarten zu der von Karl Kraus 1899 
bis 1936 herausgegebenen Zeitschrift ‘Die Fackel’”), has been 
corrected  and  enriched  by  the AAC  with  information. The 
digital  edition  allows  new  ways  of  philological  research  and 
analysis and offers new perspectives for literary studies.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The digital edition of the journal “Die Fackel” (“The Torch”), 
published  and  almost  entirely  written  by  the  satirist  and 
language  critic  Karl  Kraus  in Vienna  from  1899  until  1936, 
offers  free  online  access  to  37  volumes,  415  issues,  922 
numbers,  comprising  more  than  22.500  pages  and  6  million 
tokens.  It  contains  a  fully  searchable  database  of  the  journal 
with  various  indexes,  search  tools  and  navigation  aids  in  an 
innovative  and  functional  graphic  design  interface,  where 
all  pages  of  the  original  are  available  as  digital  texts  and  as 
facsimile  images. The  work  of  Karl  Kraus  in  its  many  forms, 
of  which  the  journal  is  the  core,  can  be  regarded  as  one  of 
the most important, contributions to world literature. It is a 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 2. BRENNER ONLINE Interface
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  literary  journal “Der  Brenner”  was  published  between 
1910 and 1954 in Innsbruck by Ludwig Ficker. The text of 18 
volumes,  104  issues,  which  is  a  small  segment  of  the AAC’s 
overall holdings, is 2 million tokens of corrected and annotated 
text, provided with additional information. “Die Fackel” had set 
an example for Ludwig Ficker and his own publication. Contrary 
to  the  more  widely  read  satirical  journal  of  Karl  Kraus,  the 
more  quiet  “Der  Brenner”  deals  primarily  with  themes  of 
religion, nature, literature and culture. The philosopher Ludwig 
Wittgenstein was afﬁ liated with the group and participated in 
the debates launched by the journal. Among its contributors 
is the expressionist poet Georg Trakl, the writer Carl Dallago, 
the translator and cultural critic Theodor Haecker, translator 
of  Søren  Kierkegaard  and  Cardinal  Newman  into  German, 
the  moralist  philosopher  Ferdinand  Ebner  and  many  others. 
The journal covers a variety of subjects and is an important 
voice  of Austrian  culture  in  the  pre  and  post  second  world 
war  periods. The  digital  edition  has  been  made  by  the AAC 
in  collaboration  with  the  Brenner-Archive  of  the  University

to  establish  a  valuable  digital  resource  for  the  study  of  this 
literary journal.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The philological and technological principles of digital editions 
within  the AAC  are  determined  by  the  conviction  that  the 
methods of corpus research will enable us to produce valuable 
resources  for  scholars. The AAC  has  developed  such  model 
editions  to  meet  these  aims.  These  editions  provide  well 
structured and well designed access to the sources. All pages 
are  accessible  as  electronic  text  and  as  facsimile  images  of 
the original. Various indexes and search facilities are provided 
so  that  word  forms,  personal  names,  foreign  text  passages, 
illustrations  and  other  resources  can  be  searched  for  in 
various ways. The search mechanisms for personal names have 
been  implemented  in  the  interface  for  BRENNER  ONLINE 
and will be done for “Die Fackel”. The interface is designed to 
be easily accessible also to less experienced users of corpora. 
Multi-word queries are possible. The search engine supports 
left  and  right  truncation. The  interface  of  the AAC-FACKEL 
provides also search mechanisms for linguistic searches, allows 
to  perform  lemma  queries  and  offers  experimental  features. 
Instead of searching for particular word forms, queries for all 
the word forms of a particular lemma are possible. The same 
goes for the POS annotation. The web-sites of both editions 
are entirely based on XML and cognate technologies. On the 
character level use of Unicode has been made throughout. All 
of  the  content  displayed  in  the  digital  edition  is  dynamically 
created from XML data. Output is produced through means of 
XSLT style sheets. This holds for the text section, the contents 
overview and the result lists. We have adopted this approach 
to  ensure  the  viability  of  our  data  for  as  long  a  period  as 
possible.  Both  digital  editions  have  been  optimized  for  use 
with recent browser versions. One of the basic requirements 
is that the browser should be able to handle XML-Dom and 
the  local  system  should  be  furnished  with  a  Unicode  font 
capable  of  displaying  the  necessary  characters. The  interface 
has  synchronized  ﬁ ve  individual  frames  within  one  single 
window,  which  can  be  alternatively  expanded  and  closed  as 
required. The “Paratext”-section situated within the ﬁ rst frame 
provides  background  information  and  essays.  The  “Index”-
section  gives  access  to  a  variety  of  indexes,  databases  and 
full-text  search  mechanisms. The  results  are  displayed  in  the 
adjacent section. The “Contents”-section has been developed, 
to show the reader the whole range of the journal ready to 
be explored and provides access to the whole run of issues 
in  chronological  order.  The  “Text”-section  has  a  complex 
and  powerful  navigational  bar  so  that  the  reader  can  easily 
navigate and read within the journals either in text-mode or 
in  image-mode  from  page  to  page,  from  text  to  text,  from 
issue  to  issue  and  with  the  help  of  hyperlinks. These  digital 
editions  will  function  as  models  for  similar  applications. The 
AAC’s scholarly editions of “Der Brenner” and “Die Fackel” 
will  contribute  to  the  development  of  digital  resources  for 
research into language and literature.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>agenda in arts and humanities e-Science has been developing 
over the past two years and explores some of its main tenets. 
We  offer  a  chronological  discussion  of  two  phases  in  the 
methodological  debates  about  the  applicability  of  e-science 
and e-research to arts and humanities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ﬁ rst  phase  concerns  the  methodological  discussions 
that  took  place  during  the  early  activities  of  the Theme. A 
series  of  workshops  and  presentations  about  the  role  of  e-
Science  for  arts  and  humanities  purported  to  make  existing 
e-science  methodologies  applicable  to  this  new  ﬁ eld  and 
consider  the  challenges  that  might  ensue  (http://www.nesc.
ac.uk/esi/themes/theme_06/community.htm).  Several  events 
brought together computer scientists and arts and humanities 
researchers.  Further  events  (ﬁ nished  by  the  time  of  Digital 
Humanities 2008) will include training events for postgraduate 
students  and  architectural  studies  on  building  a  national  e-
infrastructure for the arts and humanities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Due  to  space  limitations,  we  cannot  cover  all  the  early 
methodological  discussions  during  the  Theme  here,  but 
focus on two, which have been fruitful in uptake in arts and 
humanities:  Access  Grid  and  Ontological  Engineering.  A 
workshop  discussed  alternatives  for  video-conferencing  in 
the arts and humanities in order to establish virtual research 
communities. The Access  Grid  has  already  proven  to  be  of 
interest in arts and humanities research. This is not surprising, 
as  researchers  in  these  domains  often  need  to  collaborate 
with other researchers around the globe. Arts and humanities 
research  often  takes  place  in  highly  specialised  domains  and 
subdisciplines,  niche  subjects  with  expertise  spread  across 
universities. The Access Grid can provide a cheaper alternative 
to face-to-face meetings.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>However,  online  collaboration  technologies  like  the  Access 
Grid  need  to  be  better  adapted  to  the  speciﬁ c  needs  of 
humanities researchers by e.g. including tools to collaboratively 
edit and annotate documents. The Access Grid might be a good 
substitute to some face-to-face meetings, but lacks innovative 
means of collaboration, which can be especially important in 
arts  and  humanities  research. We  should  aim  to  realise  real 
multicast interaction, as it has been done in VNC technology 
or basic wiki technology. These could support new models of 
collaboration in which the physical organisation of the Access 
Grid suite can be accommodated to speciﬁ c needs that would 
e.g.  allow  participants  to  walk  around.  The  procedure  of 
Access Grid sessions could also be changed, away from static 
meetings towards more dynamic collaborations.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of e-Science 
and e-Research activities for the arts and humanities in the UK. 
It will focus on research projects and trends and will not cover 
the institutional infrastructure to support them. In particular, 
we  shall  explore  the  methodological  discussions  laid  out  in 
the Arts  and  Humanities  e-Science Theme,  jointly  organised 
by the Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre and the 
e-Science  Institute  in  Edinburgh  (http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/
themes/theme_06/). The second focus of the paper will be the 
current and future activities within the Arts and Humanities 
e-Science  Initiative  in  the  UK  and  their  methodological 
consequences (http://www.ahessc.ac.uk).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The projects presented so far are all good indicators of what 
the future might deliver, as ‘grand challenges’ for the arts and 
humanities  e-Science  programme  such  as  the  emerging  data 
deluge (Hey and Trefethen 2003). The Bush administration will 
have produced over 100 million emails by the end of its term 
(Unsworth 2006). These can provide the basis for new types of 
historical and socio-political research that will take advantage 
of computational methods to deal with digital data. However, 
for arts and humanities research an information is not just an 
information.  Complicated  semantics  underlie  the  archives  of 
human reports. As a simple example, it cannot be clear from 
the email alone which Bush administration or even which Iraq 
war are under consideration. Moreover, new retrieval methods 
for such data must be intuitive for the user and not based on 
complicated  metadata  schemes. They  have  to  be  speciﬁ c  in 
their return and deliver exactly that piece of information the 
researcher  is  interested  in. This  is  fairly  straightforward  for 
structured information if it is correctly described, but highly 
complex  for  unstructured  information. Arts  and  humanities 
additionally  need  the  means  to  on-demand  reconﬁ gure  the 
retrieval process by using computational power that changes 
the  set  of  information  items  available  from  texts,  images, 
movies, etc. This paper argues that a speciﬁ c methodological 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Humanities  scholars  and  performers  have  priorities  and 
concerns that are often different from those of scientists and 
engineers (Nentwich 2003). With growing size of data resources 
the  need  arises  to  use  recent  methodological  frameworks 
such as ontologies to increase the semantic interoperability of 
data. Building ontologies in the humanities is a challenge, which 
was  the  topic  of  the Theme  workshop  on ‘Ontologies  and 
Semantic Interoperability for Humanities Data’. While semantic 
integration  has  been  a  hot  topic  in  business  and  computing 
_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>research, there are few existing examples for ontologies in the 
Humanities,  and  they  are  generally  quite  limited,  lacking  the 
richness  that  full-blown  ontologies  promise. The  workshop 
clearly pointed at problems mapping highly contextual data as 
in the humanities to highly formalized conceptualization and 
speciﬁ cations of domains.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The activities within the UK’s arts and humanities e-Science 
community  demonstrate  the  speciﬁ c  needs  that  have  to  be 
addressed  to  make  e-Science  work  within  these  disciplines 
(Blanke  and  Dunn  2006). The  early  experimentation  phase, 
which included the Theme events presented supra, delivered 
projects that were mostly trying out existing approaches in e-
Science. They demonstrated the need for a new methodology 
to meet the requirements of humanities data that is particularly 
fuzzy and inconsistent, as it is not automatically produced, but 
is the result of human effort. It is fragile and its presentation 
often difﬁ cult, as e.g. data in performing arts that only exists 
as an event.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  second  phase  of  arts  and  humanities  e-Science  began 
in  September  2007  with  seven  3-4  years  projects  that  are 
moving  away  from  ad  hoc  experimentation  towards  a  more 
systematic  investigation  of  methodologies  and  technologies 
that  could  provide  answers  to  grand  challenges  in  arts  and 
humanities  research.  This  second  phase  could  be  put  in  a 
nutshell as e-science methodology-led innovative research in 
arts and humanity.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Next to performance, music research e.g. plays an important 
vanguard  function  at  adopting  e-Science  methodologies, 
mostly  because  many  music  resources  are  already  available 
in  digital  formats.  At  Goldsmiths,  University  of  London, 
the  project ‘Purcell  Plus’  e.g.  will  build  upon  the  successful 
collaboration  ‘Online  Musical  Recognition  and  Searching 
(OMRAS)’  (http://www.omras.org/),  which  has  just  achieved 
a second phase of funding by the EPSRC. With OMRAS, it will 
be possible to efﬁ ciently search large-scale distributed digital 
music  collections  for  related  passages,  etc. The  project  uses 
grid  technologies  to  index  the  very  large  distributed  music 
resources. ‘Purcell Plus’ will make use of the latest explosion in 
digital data for music research. It uses Purcell’s autograph MS 
of ‘Fantazies and In Nomines for instrumental ensemble’ and 
will investigate the methodology problems for using toolkits 
like OMRAS for musicology research. ‘Purcell Plus’ will adopt 
the  new  technologies  emerging  from  music  information 
retrieval,  without  the  demand  to  change  completely  proven 
to be good methodologies in musicology. The aim is to suggest 
that  new  technologies  can  help  existing  research  and  open 
new research domains in terms of the quantity of music and 
new quantitative methods of evaluation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Birmingham, which will investigate the need for medieval states 
to  sustain  armies  by  organising  and  distributing  resources. 
A  grid-based  framework  shall  virtually  reenact  the  Battle  of 
Manzikert  in  1071,  a  key  historic  event  in  Byzantine  history. 
Agent-based modelling technologies will attempt to ﬁ nd out 
more  about  the  reasons  why  the  Byzantine  army  was  so 
heavily defeated by the Seljurk Turks. Grid environments offer 
the chance to solve such complex human problems through 
distributed simultaneous computing.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In all the new projects, we can identify a clear trend towards 
investigating  new  methodologies  for  arts  and  humanities 
research,  possible  only  because  grid  technologies  offer 
unknown data and computational resources. We could see how 
e-Science in the arts and humanities has matured towards the 
development of concrete tools that systematically investigate 
the use of e-Science for research. Whether it is simulation of 
past battles or musicology using state-of-the-art information 
retrieval  techniques,  this  research  would  have  not  been 
possible  before  the  shift  in  methodology  towards  e-Science 
and e-Research.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>    An OWL-based index of 
emblem metaphors 
 Peter Boot  
peter.boot@huygensinstituut.knaw.nl
Huygens Institute  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Intro
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper describes an index on metaphor in Otto Vaenius’ 
emblem  book  Amoris  divini  emblemata  (Antwerp,  1615). The 
index should be interesting both for its contents (that is, for 
the information about the use of metaphor in the book) and 
as an example of modelling a complex literary phenomenon. 
Modelling  a  complex  phenomenon  creates  the  possibility  to 
formulate complex queries on the descriptions that are based 
on the model. The article describes an application that uses this 
possibility. The application user can interrogate the metaphor 
data in multiple ways, ranging from canned queries to complex 
selections built in the application’s guided query interface.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Unlike other emblem indices, the metaphor index is not meant 
to be a tool for resource discovery, a tool that helps emblem 
scholars ﬁ nd emblems relevant to their own research. It presents 
research output rather than input. The modelling techniques 
that it exempliﬁ es should help a researcher formulate detailed 
observations or ﬁ ndings about his research subject – in this 
case, metaphor – and make these ﬁ ndings amenable to further 
processing. The result is an index, embedded in an overview 
or explanation of the data for the reader. I will argue that for 
research output data it is up to the researcher who uses these 
modelling techniques to integrate the presentation of data in 
a narrative or argument, and I describe one possible way of 
effecting this integration.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The paper builds on the techniques developed in (Boot 2006). 
The emblem book is encoded using TEI; a model of metaphor 
(an ontology) is formulated in OWL; the observations about 
the occurrence of metaphors are stored as RDF statements. 
An essay about the more important metaphors in this book 
is  encoded  in  TEI.  This  creates  a  complex  and  interlinked 
structure that may be explored in a number of ways. The essay 
is hyperlinked to (1) individual emblems, (2) the presentation of 
individual metaphors in emblems, (3) searches in the metaphor 
data, and (4) concepts in the metaphor ontology. From each of 
these locations, further exploration is possible. Besides these 
ready-made queries, the application also facilitates user-deﬁ ned 
queries  on  the  metaphor  data. The  queries  are  formulated 
using the SPARQL RDF query language, but the application’s 
guided query interface hides the actual syntax from the user.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Metaphor model
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Richards  (1936). When  love,  for  its  strength  en  endurance 
in  adversity,  is  compared  to  a  tree,  the  tree  is  the  vehicle, 
love  is  the  tenor.  It  is  possible  to  deﬁ ne  hierarchies,  both 
for the comparands (that is, vehicles and tenors) and for the 
metaphors: we can state that ‘love as a tree’ (love being ﬁ rmly 
rooted)  belongs  to  a  wider  class  of ‘love  as  a  plant’  (love 
bearing  fruit)  metaphors. We  can  also  state  that  a  tree  is  a 
plant, and that it (with roots, fruit, leaves and seeds) belongs 
to  the  vegetal  kingdom  (Lakoff  and  Johnson  1980).  It  often 
happens  that  an  emblem  contains  references  to  an  object 
invested  with  metaphorical  meaning  elsewhere  in  the  book. 
The  index  can  record  these  references  without  necessarily 
indicating something they are supposed to stand for.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The index can also represent the locations in the emblem (the 
text and image fragments) that refer to the vehicles and tenors. 
The text fragments are stretches of emblem text, the image 
fragments are rectangular regions in the emblem pictures. The 
index uses the TEI-encoded text structure in order to relate 
occurrences of the comparands to locations in the text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The metaphor model is formulated using the Web Ontology 
Language  OWL  (McGuinness  and Van  Harmelen  2004).  An 
ontology  models  the  kind  of  objects  that  exist  in  a  domain, 
their  relationships  and  their  properties;  it  provides  a  shared 
understanding of a domain. On a technical level, the ontology 
deﬁ nes the vocabulary to be used in the RDF statements in 
our  model. The  ontology  thus  limits  the  things  one  can  say; 
it provides, in McCarty’s words (McCarty 2005), the ‘explicit, 
delimited  conception  of  the  world’  that  makes  meaningful 
manipulation  possible. The  ontology  is  also  what ‘drives’  the 
application built for consultation of the metaphor index. See 
for  similar  uses  of  OWL:  (Ciula  and Vieira  2007),  (Zöllner-
Weber 2005).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The paper describes the classes and the relationships between 
them that the OWL model contains. Some of these relationships 
are hierarchical (‘trees belong to the vegetal kingdom’), others 
represent  relations  between  objects  (‘emblem  6  uses  the 
metaphor of life as a journey’ or ‘metaphor 123 is a metaphor 
for  justice’). The  relationships  are  what  makes  it  possible  to 
query objects by their relations to other objects: to ask for all 
the metaphors based in an emblem picture, to ask for all of the 
metaphors for love, or to combine these criteria.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Application
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  order  to  present  the  metaphor  index  to  a  reader,  a  web 
application has been developed that allows readers to consult 
and  explore  the  index. The  application  is  an  example  of  an 
ontology-driven  application  as  discussed  in  (Guarino  1998): 
the data model, the application logic and the user interface are 
all based on the metaphor ontology.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There is a number of aspects of metaphor and the texts where 
metaphors  occur  that  are  modelled  in  the  metaphor  index. 
A metaphor has a vehicle and a tenor, in the terminology of 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The application was created using PHP and a MySQL database 
backend. RAP, the RDF API for PHP, is used for handling RDF.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>are stored in an RDF model in the database. RDF triples that 
represent the structure of the emblem book are created from 
the TEI XML ﬁ le that contains the digital text of the emblem 
book.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The application has to provide insight into three basic layers of 
information: our primary text (the emblems), the database-like 
collection of metaphor data, and a secondary text that should 
make these three layers into a coherent whole. The application 
organizes this in three perspectives: an overview perspective, 
an emblem perspective and an ontology perspective. Each of 
these perspectives offers one or more views on the data. These 
views  are  (1)  a  basic  selection  interface  into  the  metaphor 
index; (2) an essay about the use and meaning of metaphor in 
this book; (3) a single emblem display; (4) information about 
metaphor use in the emblem; and (5) a display of the ontology 
deﬁ ned  for  the  metaphor  index  (built  using  the  OWLDoc). 
The paper will discuss the ways in which the user can explore 
the metaphor data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Discussion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  metaphor  index  is  experimental,  among  other  things  in 
its  modelling  of  metaphor  and  in  its  use  of  OWL  and  RDF 
in  a  humanities  context.  If Willard  McCarty  is  right  in  some 
respects  all  humanities  computing  is  experimental. There  is, 
however, a certain tension between the experimental nature 
of this index and the need to collect a body of material and 
create a display application. If the aim is not to support resource 
discovery, but solely to provide insight, do we then need this 
large amount of data? Is all software meant to be discarded, as 
McCarty quotes Perlis? The need to introduce another aspect 
of  metaphor  into  the  model  may  conﬂ ict  with  the  need  to 
create a body of material that it is worthwhile to explore. It 
is also true, however, that insight doesn’t come from subtlety 
alone. There is no insight without numbers.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>McCarty writes about the computer as ‘a rigorously disciplined 
means of implementing trial-and-error (…) to help the scholar 
reﬁ ne  an  inevitable  mismatch  between  a  representation  and 
reality (as he or she conceives it) to the point at which the 
epistemological yield of the representation has been realized’. 
It is true that the computer helps us be rigorous and disciplined, 
but perhaps for that very reason the representations that the 
computer helps us build may become a burden. Computing can 
slow us down. To clarify the conceptual structure of metaphor 
as it is used in the book we do not necessarily need a work 
of  reference. The  paper’s  concluding  paragraphs  will  address 
this tension.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Collaborative tool-building 
with Pliny: a progress report 
 John Bradley
john.bradley@kcl.ac.uk
  King’s College London, UK, 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> In  the  early  days  the  Digital  Humanities  (DH)  focused  on 
the  development  of  tools  to  support  the  individual  scholar 
to  perform  original  scholarship,  and  tools  such  as  OCP  and 
TACT emerged that were aimed at the individual scholar.  Very 
little  tool-building  within  the  DH  community  is  now  aimed 
generally  at  individual  scholarship.   There  are,  I  think,  two 
reasons for this:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• First, the advent of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
made tool building (in terms of software applications that 
ran on the scholar’s own machine) very expensive.  Indeed, 
until recently, the technical demands it put upon developers 
have been beyond the resources of most tool developers 
within the Humanities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Second, the advent of the WWW has shifted the focus 
of much of the DH community to the web.  However, as a 
result, tool building has mostly focused on not the doing of 
scholarly research but on the publishing of resources that 
represent the result of this.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>DH’s tools to support the publishing of, say, primary sources, 
are  of  course  highly  useful  to  the  researcher  when  his/her 
primary research interest is the preparation of a digital edition.  
They  are  not  directly  useful  to  the  researcher  using  digital 
resources.  The problem (discussed in detail in Bradley 2005) 
is that a signiﬁ cant amount of the potential of digital materials 
to support individual research is lost in the representation in 
the browser, even when based on AJAX or Web 2.0 practices.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Pliny project (Pliny 2006-7) attempts to draw our attention 
as tool builders back to the user of digital resources rather than 
their creator, and is built on the assumption that the software 
application, and not the browser, is perhaps the best platform 
to give the user full beneﬁ t of a digital resource.  Pliny is not 
the only project that recognises this.  The remarkable project 
Zotero  (Zotero  2006-7)  has  developed  an  entire  plugin  to 
provide a substantial new set of functions that the user can do 
within their browser.  Other tool builders have also recognised 
that the browser restricts the kind of interaction with their 
data  too  severely  and  have  developed  software  applications 
that are not based on the web browser (e.g. Xaira (2005-7), 
WordHoard (2006-7), Juxta (2007), VLMA (2005-7)). Some of 
these  also  interact  with  the  Internet,  but  they  do  it  in  ways 
outside of conventional browser capabilities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Further  to  the  issue  of  tool  building  is  the  wish  within  the 
DH  community  to  create  tools  that  work  well  together.  
This problem has often been described as one of modularity 
–  building  separate  components  that,  when  put  together, 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
65
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>allow  the  user  to  combine  them  to  accomplish  a  range  of 
things perhaps beyond the capability of each tool separately.  
Furthermore,  our  community  has  a  particularly  powerful 
example  of  modularity  in  Wilhelm  Ott’s  splendid  TuStep 
software (Ott 2000).  TuStep is a toolkit containing a number 
of separate small programs that each perform a rather abstract 
function,  but  can  be  assembled  in  many  ways  to  perform  a 
very  large  number  of  very  different  text  processing  tasks.  
However, although TuStep is a substantial example of software 
designed as a toolkit, the main discussion of modularity in the 
DH  (going  back  as  far  as  the  CETH  meetings  in  the  1990s) 
has  been  in  terms  of  collaboration  –  ﬁ nding  ways  to  support 
the development of tools by different developers that, in fact, 
can  co-operate.   This  is  a  very  different  issue  from  the  one 
TuStep models for us.  There is as much or more design work 
employed to create TuStep’s framework in which the separate 
abstract components operate (the overall system) as there is 
in the design of each component itself. This approach simply 
does  not  apply  when  different  groups  are  designing  tools 
semi-independently. What  is  really  wanted  is  a  world  where 
software tools such as WordHoard can be designed in ways 
that allow other tools (such as Juxta) to interact in a GUI, on 
the screen.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Why is this so difﬁ cult? Part of the problem is that traditional 
software development focuses on a “stack” approach.  Layers 
of  ever-more  speciﬁ c  software  are  built  on  top  of  more-
general layers to create a speciﬁ c application, and each layer in 
the stack is aimed more precisely at the ultimate functions the 
application was meant to provide.  In the end each application 
runs in a separate window on the user’s screen and is focused 
speciﬁ cally and exclusively on the functions the software was 
meant to do.  Although software could be written to support 
interaction between different applications, it is in practice still 
rarely considered, and is difﬁ cult to achieve.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Pliny, then, is about two issues: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• First, Pliny focuses on digital annotation and note-taking 
in humanities scholarship, and shows how they can be used 
facilitate the development of an interpretation.  This has 
been described in previous papers and is not presented 
here.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Second, Pliny models how one could be building GUI-
oriented software applications that, although developed 
separately, support a richer set of interactions and 
integration on the screen.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  presentation  focuses  primarily  on  this  second  theme, 
and is a continuation of the issues raised at last year’s poster 
session on this subject for the DH2007 conference (Bradley 
2007).    It  arises  from  a  consideration  of  Pliny’s  ﬁ rst  issue 
since  note-taking  is  by  its  very  nature  an  integrative  activity 
– bringing together materials created in the context of a large 
range of resources and kinds of resources.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Instead  of  the  “stack”  model  of  software  design,  Pliny  is 
constructed on top of the Eclipse framework (Eclipse 2005-
7), and uses its contribution model based on Eclipse’s plugin 
approach (see a description of it in Birsan 2005). This approach 
promotes  effective  collaborative,  yet 
independent,  tool 
building and makes possible many different kinds of interaction 
between separately written applications.  Annotation provides 
an excellent motivation for this.  A user may wish to annotate 
something in, say, WordHoard.  Later, this annotation will need 
to be shown with annotations attached to other objects from 
other pieces of software.  If the traditional “stack” approach 
to software is applied, each application would build their own 
annotation  component  inside  their  software,  and  the  user 
would not be able to bring notes from different tools together.  
Instead of writing separate little annotation components inside 
each application, Eclipse allows objects from one application to 
participate as “ﬁ rst-class” objects in the operation of another. 
Annotations belong simultaneously to the application in which 
they  were  created,  and  to  Pliny’s  annotation-note-taking 
management system.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Pliny’s  plugins  both  support  the  manipulation  of  annotations 
while  simultaneously  allowing  other  (properly  constructed) 
applications  to  create  and  display  annotations  that  Pliny 
manages  for  them.    Furthermore,  Pliny  is  able  to  recognise 
and  represent  references  to  materials  in  other  applications 
within its own displays.  See Figures I and II for examples of 
this, in conjunction with the prototype VLMA (2005-7) plugin 
I  created  from  the  standalone  application  produced  by  the 
VLMA  development  team.    In  Figure  I  most  of  the  screen 
is  managed  by  the VLMA  application,  but  Pliny  annotations 
have  been  introduced  and  combined  with VLMA  materials.  
Similarly, in ﬁ gure II, most of the screen is managed by Pliny 
and its various annotation tools, but I have labelled areas on 
the screen where aspects of the VLMA application still show 
through.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure II: VLMA objects in a Pliny context
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This connecting of annotation to a digital object rather than 
merely  to  its  display  presents  some  new  issues. What,  for 
example,  does  it  mean  to  link  an  annotation  to  a  line  of  a 
KWIC display – should that annotation appear when the same 
KWIC display line appears in a different context generated as 
the result of a different query?  Should it appear attached to 
the particular word token when the document it contains is 
displayed? If an annotation is attached to a headword, should it 
be displayed automatically in a different context when its word 
occurrences are displayed, or only in the context in which the 
headword itself is displayed? These are the kind of questions of 
annotation and context that can only really be explored in an 
integrated environment such as the one described here, and 
some  of  the  discussion  in  this  presentation  will  come  from 
prototypes built to work with the RDF data application VLMA, 
with the beginnings of a TACT-like text analysis tool, and on 
a tool based on Google maps that allows one to annotate a 
map.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Building our tools in contexts such as Pliny’s that allow for a 
complex interaction between components results in a much 
richer, and more appropriate, experience for our digital user.  
For  the  ﬁ rst  time,  perhaps,  s/he  will  be  able  to  experience 
the kind of interaction between the materials that are made 
available through applications that expose, rather than hide, the 
true potential of digital objects.  Pliny provides a framework 
in which objects from different tools are brought into close 
proximity  and  connected  by  the  paradigm  of  annotation.  
Perhaps there are also paradigms other than annotation that 
are equally interesting for object linking?

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper we discuss some of the problems that arise when 
searching  for  misspelled  names.  We  suggest  a  solution  to 
overcome these and to disambiguate the names found.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Nineteenth-Century  Serials  Edition  (NCSE)  is  a  digital 
edition  of  six  nineteenth-century  newspaper  and  periodical 
titles. It is a collaborative project between Birkbeck College, 
King’s College London, the British Library and Olive Software 
Inc. funded by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. 
The corpus consists of about 100,000 pages that were micro-
ﬁ lmed,  scanned  in  and  processed  using  optical  character 
recognition  software  (OCR)  to  obtain  images  for  display  in 
the web application as well as the full text of the publications. 
In the course of this processing (by Olive Software) the text 
of  each  individual  issue  was  also  automatically  segmented 
into  its  constituent  parts  (newspaper  departments,  articles, 
advertisements, etc.).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  application  of  text  mining  techniques  (named  entity 
extraction, text categorisation, etc.) allowed names, institutions 
and places etc. to be extracted as well as individual articles to 
be  classiﬁ ed  according  to  events,  subjects  and  genres.  Users 
of the digital edition can search for very speciﬁ c information. 
The extent to which these searches are successful depends, of 
course, on the quality of the available data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The problem
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The quality of some of the text resulting from the OCR process 
varies from barely readable to illegible. This reﬂ ects the poor 
print quality of the original paper copies of the publications. A 
simple search of the scanned and processed text for a person’s 
name, for example, would retrieve exact matches, but ignore 
incorrectly spelled or distorted variations.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Misspellings  of  ordinary  text  could  be  checked  against  an 
authoritative  electronic  dictionary.  An  equivalent  reference 
work  for  names  does  not  exist.  This  paper  describes  the 
solutions  that  are  being  investigated  to  overcome  these 
difﬁ culties.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The actress Mrs. Billington is mentioned twice. OCR recognised 
the  name  once  as  Mrs.  lUllinijton  and  then  as  Mrs. 
BIIMngton. A simple search for the name Billington would 
therefore be unsuccessful.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By  applying  a  combination  of  approximate  string  matching 
techniques and allowing for a certain amount of spelling errors 
(see below) our more reﬁ ned approach successfully ﬁ nds the 
two distorted spellings as Mrs. Billington. However, it 
also ﬁ nds a number of other unrelated names (Wellington 
and  Rivington  among  others). This  additional  problem  is 
redressed by mapping misspelled names to correctly spelled 
names.  Using  a  combination  of  string  similarity  and  string 
distance algorithms we have developed an application to rank 
misspelled names according to their likelihood of representing 
a correctly spelled name.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The algorithm
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As  already  brieﬂ y  mentioned  above  we  are  applying  several 
well  known  pattern  matching  algorithms  to  perform 
approximate  pattern  matching,  where  the  pattern  is  a  given 
name (a surname normally), and the “text” is a (huge) list of 
names,  obtained  from  the  OCR  of  scanned  documents. The 
novelty of this work comes from the fact that we are utilizing 
application-speciﬁ c  characteristics  to  achieve  better  results 
than are  possible through  general-purpose  pattern matching 
techniques.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Currently  we  are  considering  the  pattern  to  be  error-free 
(although our algorithms can easily be extended to deal with 
errors in the pattern too). Moreover, all the algorithms take as 
input the maximum “distance” that a name in the list may have 
from  the  pattern  to  be  considered  a  match;  this  distance  is 
given as a percentage. As one would expect, there is a tradeoff 
in distance - quality of matches: low distance threshold yields 
less false positives, but may miss some true matches; on the 
other  hand,  a  high  distance  threshold  has  less  chances  of 
missing true matches, but will return many fake ones.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At  the  heart  of  the  algorithms  lies  a  ranking  system,  the 
purpose of which is to sort the matching names according to 
how well they match. (Recall that the list of matching names 
can  be  huge,  and  thus  what  is  more  important  is  really  the 
ranking of those matches, to distinguish the good ones from 
random matches.) Obviously, the ranking system depends on 
the distance-metric in use, but there is more to be taken into 
account. Notice that, if a name matches our pattern with some 
error,  e, there are two cases:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- either the name is a true match, and the error e is due to 
bad OCR, or
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- the name (misspelled or not, by OCR) does not 
correspond to our pattern, in which case it is a bad match 
and should receive a lower rank.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It  is  therefore  essential,  given  a  possibly  misspelled  (due  to 
OCR) name, s’, to identify the true name, s, that it corresponds 
to. Then, it is obvious that s’ is a good match if p = s, and a bad 
match otherwise, where p is the pattern. To identify whether a 
name s’ in our list is itself a true name, or has been mispelled 
we use two types of evaluation:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In the case where s’ is indeed mispelled by OCR, and is thus 
not  a  true  name,  one  must  use  distance  metrics  to  identify 
how closely it matches the pattern p. Given that the pattern is 
considered to be error-free, if the distance of the name from 
the pattern is large then it is very unlikely (but not impossible) 
that too many of the symbols of the name have been mispelled 
by  OCR;  instead,  most  probably  the  name  does  not  really 
match the pattern.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Taking into account the nature of the errors that occur in our 
application,  when  computing  the  distance  of  a  name  in  the 
list from our pattern, we consider optical similarities. That is, 
we drop the common tactic where one symbol is compared 
against another symbol, and either they match - so the distance 
is 0, or they don’t - so the distance is 1; instead, we consider 
a  symbol  (or  a  group  of  symbols)  to  have  a  low  distance 
from  another  symbol  (or  group  of  symbols)  if  their  shapes 
look  similar. As  an  example,  check  that “m”  is  optically  very 
similar to “rn”, and thus should be assigned a small distance, 
say 1, while “m” and “b” do not look similar to each other and 
therefore should have a big distance, say 10.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The results of our efforts to date have been very promising. 
We  look  forward  to  investigating  opportunities  to  improve 
the effectiveness of the algorithm in the future.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>    Orlando: Women’s Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings 
to the Present is a literary-historical textbase comprising more 
than  1,200  core  entries  on  the  lives  and  writing  careers  of 
British women writers, male writers, and international women 
writers;  13,000+  free-standing  chronology  entries  providing 
context;  12,000+  bibliographical  listings;  and  more  than  2 
million  tags  embedded  in  6.5  million  words  of  born-digital 
text. The  XML  tagset  allows  users  to  interrogate  everything 
from writers’ relationships with publishers to involvement in 
political activities or their narrative techniques.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The current interface allows users to access entries by name 
or  via  various  criteria  associated  with  authors;  to  create 
chronologies  by  searching  on  tags  and/or  contents  of  dated 
materials; and to search the textbase for tags, attributes, and 
text, or a combination. The XML serves primarily to structure 
the  materials;  to  allow  users  to  draw  on  particular  tags  to 
bring  together  results  sets  (of  one  or  more  paragraphs 
incorporating the actual ‘hit’) according to particular interests; 
and  to  provide  automatic  hyperlinking  of  names,  places, 
organizations, and titles.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Recognizing both that many in our target user community of 
literary  students  and  scholars  dislike  tag  searches,  and  that 
our  current  interface  has  not  fully  plumbed  the  potential  of 
Orlando’s experimentation in structured text, we are exploring 
what other kinds of enquiry and interfaces the textbase can 
support. We report here on some investigations into new ways 
of probing and representing the links created by the markup.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  current  interface  leverages  the  markup  to  provide 
contexts for hyperlinks. Each author entry includes a “Links” 
screen  that  provides  hyperlinks  to  mentions  of  that  author 
elsewhere in the textbase. These links are sorted into groups 
based on the semantic tags of which they are children, so that 
users can choose, for instance, from the more than 300 links 
on the George Eliot Links screen, between a link to Eliot in 
the Elizabeth Stuart Phelps entry that occurs in the context of 
Family or Intimate Relationships, and a link to Eliot in Simone 
de Beauvoir’s entry that occurs in the discussion of features 
of  de  Beauvoir’s  writing.  Contextualizing  Links  screens  are 
provided not only for writers who have entries, but also for 
any person who is mentioned more than once in the textbase, 
and  also  for  titles  of  texts,  organizations,  and  places.  It  thus 
provides  a  unique  means  for  users  to  pursue  links  in  a  less 
directed and more informed way than that provided by many 
interfaces.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Building on this work, we have been investigating how Orlando 
might  support  queries  into  relationships  and  networking, 
and  present  not  just  a  single  relationship  but  the  results  of 
investigating  an  entire  ﬁ eld  of  interwoven  relationships  of 
the kind that strongly interest literary historians. Rather than 
beginning from a known set of networks or interconnections, 
how might we exploit our markup to analyze interconnections, 
reveal  new  links,  or  determine  the  points  of  densest 
interrelationship? Interface design in particular, if we start to 
think  about  visualizing  relationships  rather  than  delivering 
them entirely in textual form, poses considerable challenges.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  started  with  the  question  of  the  degrees  of  separation 
between  different  people  mentioned  in  disparate  contexts 
within  the  textbase.  Our  hyperlinking  tags  allow  us  to 
conceptualize links between people not only in terms of direct 
contact, that is person-to-person linkages, but also in terms of 
linkages through other people, places, organizations, or texts 
that they have in common. Drawing on graph theory, we use 
the hyperlinking tags as key indices of linkages. Two hyperlinks 
coinciding within a single document—an entry or a chronology 
event--were  treated  as  vertices  that  form  an  edge,  and  an 
algorithm was used to ﬁ nd the shortest path between source 
and destination. So, for instance, you can get from Chaucer to 
Virginia Woolf in a single step in twelve different ways: eleven 
other writer entries (including Woolf’s own) bring their names 
together, as does the following event:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1  November  1907:  The  British  Museum’s  reading  room 
reopened  after  being  cleaned  and  redecorated;  the  dome 
was  embellished  with  the  names  of  canonical  male  writers, 
beginning with Chaucer and ending with Browning.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Virginia  Woolf’s  A  Room  of  One’s  Own  describes  the 
experience of standing under the dome “as if one were a 
thought  in  the  huge  bald  forehead  which  is  so  splendidly 
encircled by a band of famous names.” Julia Hege in Jacob’s 
Room complains that they did not leave room for an Eliot 
or a Brontë.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It takes more steps to get from some writers to others: ﬁ ve, 
for instance, to get from Frances Harper to Ella Baker. But this 
is very much the exception rather than the rule.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Calculated according to the method described here, we have 
a vast number of links: the textbase contains 74,204 vertices 
with an average of 102 edges each (some, such as London at 
101,936,  have  considerably  more  than  others),  meaning  that 
there  are  7.5  million  links  in  a  corpus  of  6.5  million  words. 
Working  just  with  authors  who  have  entries,  we  calculated 
the number of steps between them all, excluding some of the 
commonest links: the Bible, Shakespeare, England, and London. 
Nevertheless, the vast majority of authors (on average 88%) 
were linked by a single step (such as the example of Chaucer 
and Woolf,  in  which  the  link  occurs  within  the  same  source 
document) or two steps (in which there is one intermediate 
document  between  the  source  and  destination  names). 
Moreover, there is a striking similarity in the distribution of the 
number of steps required to get from one person to another, 
regardless of whether one moves via personal names, places, 
organizations, or titles. 10.6% of entries are directly linked, that 
is the two authors are mentioned in the same source entry or 
event. Depending on the hyperlinking tag used, one can get to 
the destination author with just one intermediate step, or two 
degrees of separation, in 72.2% to 79.6% of cases. Instances of 
greater numbers of steps decline sharply, so that there are 5 
degrees of separation in only 0.6% of name linkage pages, and 
none at all for places. Six degrees of separation does not exist 
in Orlando between authors with entries, although there are a 
few “islands”, in the order of from 1.6% to 3.2%, depending on 
the link involved, of authors who do not link to others.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>These  results  raise  a  number  of  questions. As Albert-Lászlo 
Barabási reported of social networks generally, one isn’t dealing 
with degrees of separation so much as degrees of proximity. 
However, in this case, dealing not with actual social relations 
but the partial representation in Orlando of a network of social 
relations  from  the  past,  what  do  particular  patterns  such  as 
these mean? What do the outliers—people such as Ella Baker 
or  Frances  Harper  who  are  not  densely  interlinked  with 
others—and  islands  signify? They  are  at  least  partly  related 
to the brevity of some entries, which can result either from 
paucity of information, or decisions about depth of treatment, 
or  both.  But  might  they  sometimes  also  represent  distance 
from  literary  and  social  establishments?  Furthermore,  some 
linkages  are  more  meaningful,  in  a  literary  historical  sense, 
than  others.  For  instance,  the  Oxford  Dictionary  of  National 
Biography  is  a  common  link  because  it  is  frequently  cited  by 
title, not because it indicates a historical link between people. 
Such incidental links can’t be weeded out automatically. So we 
are  investigating  the  possibility  of  using  the  relative  number 
of  single-  or  double-step  links  between  two  authors  to 
determine how linked they ‘really’ are. For instance, Elizabeth 
Gaskell is connected to William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles 
Dickens, and George Eliot by 25, 35, and 53 single-step links, 
respectively,  but  to  Margaret  Atwood,  Gertrude  Stein,  and 
Toni Morrison by 2, 1, and 1. Such contrasts suggest the likely 
utility of such an approach to distinguishing meaningful from 
incidental associations.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  biggest  question  invited  by  these  inquiries  into  linkages 
is:  how  might  new  modes  of  inquiry  into,  or  representation 
of,  literary  history,  emerge  from  such  investigations?  One 
way  to  address  this  question  is  through  interfaces. We  have 
developed a prototype web application for querying degrees of 
separation in Orlando, for which we are developing an interface. 
Relationships or associations are conventionally represented 
by a network diagram, where the entities are shown as nodes 
and the relationships as lines connecting the nodes. Depending 
on the content, these kinds of ﬁ gures are also referred to as 
directed  graphs,  link-node  diagrams,  entity-relationship  (ER) 
diagrams,  and  topic  maps.  Such  diagrams  scale  poorly,  since 
the  proliferation  of  items  results  in  a  tangle  of  intersecting 
lines. Many layout algorithms position the nodes to reduce the 
number of crisscrossing lines, resulting in images misleading to 
people who assume that location is meaningful.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  the  case  of  Orlando,  two  additional  complexities  must  be 
addressed. First, many inter-linkages are dense: there are often 
50  distinct  routes  between  two  people. A  conventional  ER 
diagram  of  this  data  would  be  too  complex  to  be  useful  as 
an  interactive  tool,  unless  we  can  allow  the  user  to  simplify 
the  diagram.  Second,  the  Orlando  data  differs  from  the  kind 
of  data  that  would  support “distant  reading”  (Moretti  1),  so 
our  readers  will  need  to  access  the  text  that  the  diagram 
references. How, then, connect the diagram to a reading view? 
We will present our preliminary responses to these challenges 
in an interface for degree of separation queries and results. We 
are also experimenting with the Mandala browser (Cheypesh 
et  al.  2006)  for  XML  structures  as  a  means  of  exploring 
embedded  relationships.  The  current  Mandala  prototype 
cannot accommodate the amount of data and number of tags 
in  Orlando,  so  we  will  present  the  results  of  experimenting 
with  a  subset  of  the  hyperlinking  tags  as  another  means  of 
visualizing  the  dense  network  of  associations  in  Orlando’s 
representations of literary history.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> This paper documents an exploratory research in progress, 
investigating the relationship between the quality of digital 
interfaces, their technical conditions and the interfacial 
mediation of the users’ body. Here, we focus on the bodily 
dimension of gender. For this reason, we analysed two online 
role playing games with different representation modes 
(text-based versus image-based) asking which impact the 
digital interface and their technical conditions have on gender 
performances.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Following  sociological  investigations  (Bahl,  1998/  Goffman, 
2001/ Lübke, 2005/ Müller, 1996), the bodily aspect of gender 
plays  a  central  role  in  communication  settings  due  to  its 
social, cultural meaning which nowadays strongly is mediated 
by  information  technology.  For  this  reason,  we  focus  on  the 
interfaces.  We  claim  that  their  representation  mode,  their 
design and software constraints have a crucial impact on the 
virtual patterns of gender referring to individual performance, 
spatial movement and communication. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  interfacial  analysis  is  just  a  part  of  an  interdisciplinary 
inquiry  about  the  interrelation  between  gender,  design  and 
ICT. It is allocated in the overlapping ﬁ eld of sociology, gender 
studies, design research and information technology. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this respect, we regard the body and its gender as culturally 
constructed interface of social interactions and advocate for 
reﬂ ecting  it  within  the  process  software  development  and 
interface design. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this context, designers who make ICT accessible via their 
product  and  screen  designs  can  be  regarded  as  mediators 
between 
technological  requirements  and  user  needs. 
They  usually  regard  interfaces  from  the  point  of  view  of 
formal-aesthetic  (Apple  Computer,  Inc,  1992;  McKey,  1999; 
Schneiderman/  Plaisant,  2005),  or  of  usability  (Krug,  2006; 
Nielsen/  Loranger,  2006)  and  interaction-design  (Cooper/ 
Reimann,  2003;  Preece/  Rogers/  Sharp,  2002).  But  designers 
not only make ICT usable, but also culturally signiﬁ cant. In this 
respect,  they  also  deal  with  the  cultural  constructions  and 
implications  of  gender  which  have  to  be  reﬂ ected  by  their 
screen  designs. The  interfacial  conditions  decide  about  the 
bodily representations in ICT interaction.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By  referring  to  interactionist  (Goffman,  2001),  constructivist 
(Butler,  2006/  Teubner,  Wetterer,  1999/  Trettin,  1997/
West,  Zimmermann,  1991,  1995)  theories  and  sociological 
investigations  of  virtual  environments  (Eisenrieder,  2003/ 
Lübke,  2005/ Turkle,  1999),  we  claim  that  the  bodily  aspect 
of  gender  is  an  essential  reference  point  of  individual 
performance,  communication,  even  spatial  movements  not 
as  a  physical  property  of  the  body,  but  due  to  its  cultural 
meaning  and  connotative  potential.  It  is  supposed  to  be  the 
most  guiding  information  referring  to  interaction  contexts 
(Goffman, 2001/ Lübke, 2005). It has a crucial impact on the 
behavior: Being polite, e.g. opening the door for someone is 
often  a  decision  made  in  dependence  of  the  counterpart’s 
gender (Müller, 1996). Not knowing about it causes behavioral 
confusion (Bahl, 1998/ Lübke, 2005). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Research Perspectives & Research 
Questions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  contrast  to  a  sociological  point  of  view,  a  conventional 
design  perspective  or  technological  requirements,  we  add  a 
completely  new  aspect  to  design  and  technologically  driven 
inquiries in two respects:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- By taking the body as a benchmark for analyzing gender 
representations of digital interfaces. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- By investigating the virtual body and its gender 
representations from an interfacial point of view.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our investigations and reﬂ ections are guided by the 
following questions:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- Which gender images do exist in virtual spaces?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Today’s  communication  is  highly  inﬂ uenced  by  information 
technology,  which  substitutes  more  and  more  physical  body 
representations in face-to-face communication. Disembodied 
experiences  have  become  a  part  of  ordinary  life  as  self 
performances and interactions are often mediated by designed 
hardware and software interfaces.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- Which impact do the digital interface and their technical 
conditions have on gender performances?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Furthermore, we are particularly interested in knowing about 
the impact of design on preserving traditional and stereotype 
gender  images  as  well  as  on  modifying  or  deconstructing 
them.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Objects of Investigation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Methodology
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Objects  of  investigations  are  two  online  role  playing  games, 
so  called  Multi  User  Dungeons  (MUDs). They  are  especially 
suitable for this purpose because they directly refer to bodily 
representations  in  form  of  virtual  characters.  We  choose 
two  MUDs  with  different  representation  modes  in  order 
to compare the effects of opposite interfaces on the virtual 
embodiment  of  gender:  LambdaMOO,  a  popular  text-based 
online  role  playing  game  (see  Image  1  LM),  is  contrasted 
with  Second  Life,  the  currently  most  popular  and  populated 
graphical  MUD  (see  Image  1  SL).  Examining  their  interfaces 
promise to get concrete insights into the interfacial inﬂ uence 
on virtual gender images. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  use  the  methods  of  content  analysis  and  participatory 
observation – the ﬁ rst in order to explore the interfacial offer 
of options and tools to create virtual gender representations 
and  the  second  in  order  to  know,  how  it  feels  developing 
and  wearing  the  respective  gendered  skin. The  analysis  and 
observations  are  guided  and  structured  using  the  different 
dimensions  of  the  body  as  a  matrix  of  investigating  which 
are empirically generated from the observations themselves. 
Within these bodily categories, different aspects of gender are 
identiﬁ ed:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Body presence 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- modes of existence or being there
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Personality / individuality
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- forms of personal performance
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- forms of non-verbal communication (facial expressions, 
gestures, vocal intonations and accentuation)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- modes of emotional expressions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Patterns of gender
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- categories or models of gender
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Actions and spatial Movements
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- modes of behavior and actions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- modes of spatial orientation and navigation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Patterns of social behavior
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- modes of communication and interaction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Research Results
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  main  ﬁ ndings  show,  how  interfaces  and  their  speciﬁ c 
technical conditions can expand or restrict the performance 
of gender. Moreover, they demonstrate how the conventional 
bipolar  gender  model  of  western  culture  can  be  re-  and 
deconstructed by the interfacial properties and capacities. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  table  below  gives  a  summarizing  overview  about  how

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Creating digital editions so far is devoted for the most part 
to visualisation of the text. The move from mental to machine 
processing, as envisaged in the Semantic Web initiative, has not 
yet  become  a  priority  for  the  editorial  practice  in  a  digital 
environment. This  drawback  seems  to  reside  in  the  almost 
exclusive attention paid until now to markup at the expense of 
textual data models.  The move from “the database as edition” 
[Thaller, 1991: 156-59] to the “edition as a database” [Buzzetti 
et al., 1992] seems to survive only in a few examples. As a way 
forward we might regard digital editions to care more about 
processing textual information rather than just being satisﬁ ed 
with its visualisation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Here we shall concentrate on a recent case study [Rehbein, 
forthcoming], trying to focus on the kind of logical relationship 
that is established there between the markup and a database 
managing  contextual  and  procedural  information  about  the 
text. The relationship between the markup and a data model 
for  textual  information  seems  to  constitute  the  clue  to  the 
representation  of  textual  mobility.  From  an  analysis  of  this 
kind of relationship we shall tentatively try to elicit a dynamic 
model to represent textual phenomena such as variation and 
interpretation.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The case study uses the digital edition of a manuscript containing 
legal  texts  from  the  late  medieval  town  Göttingen. The  text 
shows  that  this  law  was  everything  else  but  unchangeable. 
With it, the city council reacted permanently on economical, 
political or social changes, thus adopting the law to a changing 
environment. The  text  is  consequently  characterised  by  its 
many revisions made by the scribes either by changing existing 
text or creating new versions of it. What has come to us is, thus, 
a multi-layered text, reﬂ ecting the evolutionary development 
of the law. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>West, C., Zimmerman, D.H. (1995): Doing Difference. Gender 
& Society, 9, p. 8-37.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In order to visualise and to process the text and its changes, not 
only the textual expression but, what is more, its context has 
to be regarded and described: when was the law changed, what 
was the motivation for this and what were the consequences? 
Answers  to  these  questions  are  in  fact  required  in  order 
to  reconstruct  the  different  layers  of  the  text  and  thereby 
the  evolution  of  the  law.  Regarding  the  text  nowadays,  it  is 
however not always obvious how to date the alterations. It is 
sometimes even not clear to reveal their chronological order.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A simple example shall prove this assumption. Consider the 
sentence  which  is  taken  from  the  Göttingen  bylaws  about 
beer brewing
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>we ock vorschote 100 marck, de darf 3 warve bruwen
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>together  with  150  as  a  replacement  for  100  and  2  as  a 
replacement  for  3.  (The  meaning  of  the  sentence  in  Low 
Middle German is: one, who pays 100 (150) marks as taxes, is 
allowed to brew beer 3 (2) times a year.) Without additional 
information,  the  four  following  readings  are  allowed,  all 
representing different stages of the textual development:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>providing  structured  external  information  about  the  text, 
mainly what speciﬁ c “role” a certain part of the text “plays” 
in the context of interest. Only managing and processing both, 
markup and database, will allow to reconstruct the different 
stages of the text and consequently to represent the town law 
in its evolutionary development.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Using the linkage mechanism between mark-up and database, 
the whole set of information is processable. In order to create 
a scholarly edition of the text, we can automatically produce 
a document that fulﬁ ls TEI conformity to allow the use of the 
widely  available  tools  for  transformation,  further  processing 
and possibly interchange.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>R1: we ock vorschote 100 marck, de darf 3 warve bruwen
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>R2: we ock vorschote 100 marck, de darf 2 warve bruwen
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>II.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>R3: we ock vorschote 150 marck, de darf 3 warve bruwen
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>R4: we ock vorschote 150 marck, de darf 2 warve bruwen
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>With some more information (mainly palaeographical) but still 
limited  knowledge,  three  facts  become  clear:  ﬁ rstly,  that  R1 
is the oldest version of the text, secondly that R4 is its most 
recent  and  thirdly  that  either  R2  or  R3  had  existed  as  text 
layers or none of them but not both. But what was, however, 
the  development  of  this  sentence? Was  it  the  path  directly 
from R1 to R4?  Or do we have to consider R1 > R2 > R4 or 
R1 > R3 > R4? In order to answer these questions we need 
to  know  about  the  context  of  the  text,  something  that  can 
not  be  found  in  the  text  itself.  It  is  the  external,  procedural 
and contextual knowledge that has to be linked to the textual 
expression in order to fully analyse and edit the text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Textual mobility in this example means that, to a certain extent, 
the textual expression itself, its sequence of graphemes, can be 
regarded  as  invariant  and  objective,  the  external  knowledge 
about its context cannot. It is essential in our case study not 
only to distinguish between the expression and the context of 
the text but what is more to allow ﬂ exibility in the deﬁ nition 
and  reading  of  (possible)  text  layers.  It  became  soon  clear, 
that for both, visualising and processing a dynamic text, a new 
understanding of an edition is needed, and, as a consequence, 
the  mark-up  strategy  has  to  be  reconsidered.  This  new 
understanding would “promote” the reader of an edition to 
its  user,  by  making  him  part  of  it  in  a  way  that  his  external 
knowledge, his contextual setting would have inﬂ uence on the 
representation of the text. Or in other words: dynamic text 
requires dynamic representation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The way chosen in this study is to regard textual expression 
and context (external knowledge) separately. The expression 
is  represented  by  mark-up,  encoding  the  information  about 
the text itself. Regarding this stand-alone, the different units of 
the text (its oldest version, its later alterations or annotations) 
could indeed be visualised but not be brought into a meaningful 
relationship to each other. The latter is realised by a database 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The case study just examined shows that in order to render an 
edition processable we have to relate the management system 
of the relevant data model to the markup embedded in the text. 
But we cannot provide a complete declarative model of the 
mapping of syntactic markup structures onto semantic content 
structures. The  markup  cannot  contain  a  complete  content 
model,  just  as  a  content  model  cannot  contain  a  complete 
and totally deﬁ nite expression of the text. To prove this fact 
we have to show that a markup description is equivalent to 
a second-order object language self-reﬂ exive description and 
recall that a second-order logical theory cannot be complete. 
So the mapping cannot be complete, but for the same reason 
it can be categorical; in other words, all the models of the text 
could be isomorphic. So we can look for general laws, but they 
can provide only a dynamic procedural model. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Let  us  brieﬂ y  outline  the  steps  that  lead  to  this  result.  In  a 
signiﬁ cant contribution to the understanding of “the meaning of 
the markup in a document,” [Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and 
Renear, 2000: 231] expound it as “being constituted,” and “not 
only described,” by “the set of inferences about the document 
which are licensed by the markup.” This view has inspired the 
BECHAMEL  Markup  Semantics  Project,  a  ground  breaking 
attempt  to  specify  mechanisms  “for  bridging  [...]  syntactic 
relationships  [...]  with  the  distinctive  semantic  relationships 
that  they  represent”  [Dubin  and  Birnbaum,  2004],  and  to 
investigate  in  a  systematic  way  the “mapping  [of]  syntactic 
markup  structures  [on]to  instances  of  objects,  properties, 
and relations” [Dubin, 2003] that could be processed trough 
an  appropriate  data  model.  Following  [Dubin  and  Birnbaum, 
2004],  “that markup can communicate the same meaning in 
different ways using very different syntax”, we must conclude 
that “there  are  many  ways  of  expressing  the  same  content, 
just as there are many ways of assigning a content to the same 
expression” [Buzzetti, forthcoming].
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  relationship  between  expression  and  content  is  then 
an  open  undetermined  relationship  that  can  be  formalized 
by  taking  into  account  the “performative  mood”  of  markup 
[Renear,  2001:  419].    For,  a  markup  element,  or  any  textual 
mark for that matter, is ambivalent: it can be seen as part of the 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>text, or as a metalinguistic description/ indication of a certain 
textual feature. Linguistically, markup behaves as punctuation, 
or  as  any  other  diacritical  mark,  i.e.  as  the  expression  of  a 
reﬂ exive  metalinguistic  feature  of  the  text.  Formally,  markup 
behaves  just  as  Spencer-Brown’s  symbols  do  in  his  formal 
calculus  of  indications  [1969]:  a  symbol  in  that  calculus  can 
express  both  an  operation  and  its  value  [Varela,  1979:  110-
111].
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Markup  adds  structure  to  the  text,  but  it  is  ambivalent.  It 
can  be  seen  as  the  result  of  a  restructuring  operation  on 
the  expression  of  the  text  (as  a  textual  variant)  or  as  an 
instruction to a restructuring operation on the content of the 
text (as an interpretational variant). By way of its ambivalence 
it  can  act  as  a  conversion  mechanism  between  textual  and 
interpretational  variants  [Buzzetti  and  McGann,  2006:  66] 
[Buzzetti, forthcoming].
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Markup  originates  a  loop  connecting  the  structure  of  the 
text’s  expression  to  the  structure  of  the  text’s  content. An 
implementation of the markup loop would considerably enhance 
the  functionality  of  text  representation  and  processing  in  a 
digital edition. To achieve implementation, markup information 
could  be  integrated  into  the  object  (or  datatype) ‘string’  on 
which an application system operates. Extended strings, as a 
datatype introduced by Manfred Thaller [1996, 2006], look as 
a  suitable  candidate  for  the  implementation  of  the  markup 
loop.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> A  collaboration  between  the  National Archives  in  the  UK, 
the  History  and  Centre  for  Computing  in  the  Humanities 
departments at King’s College London, the Henry III Fine Rolls 
project  (http://www.frh3.org.uk)  has  produced  both  a  digital 
and a print edition (the latter in collaboration with publisher 
Boydell & Brewer) [1] of the primary sources known as the 
Fine  Rolls. This  dual  undertaking  has  raised  questions  about 
the different presentational formats of the two resources and 
presented challenges for the historians and digital humanities 
researchers involved in the project, and, to a certain extent, 
for the publisher too.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper will examine how the two resources evolved: the 
areas  in  which  common  presentational  choices  served  both 
media, and areas in which different presentational choices and 
production  methodologies  were  necessary.  In  so  doing,  this 
paper aims to build a solid foundation for further research into 
the reading practices and integrated usage of hybrid scholarly 
editions like the Henry III Fine Rolls.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Presentation as interpretation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In Material Culture studies and, in particular, in studies of the 
book, the presentational format of text is considered to be of 
fundamental  importance  for  the  study  of  production,  social 
reading  and  use.  Therefore,  description  of  and  speculation 
about  the  physical  organisation  of  the  text  is  essential  of 
understanding the meaning of the artefact that bears that text. 
Similarly, in Human Computer Interaction studies and in the 
Digital  Humanities,  the  presentation  of  a  text  is  considered 
to  be  an  integral  outgrowth  of  the  data  modelling  process; 
a  representation  of  the  text  but  also  to  some  degree  an 
actualisation of the interpretative statements about the text. 
Indeed, to the eyes of the reader, the presentational features of 
both a printed book and a digital written object will not only 
reveal  the  assumptions  and  beliefs  of  its  creators,  but  affect 
future analysis of the work.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Dual publication: digital and print
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On the practical side, within the Henry III Fine Rolls project, 
different solutions of formatting for the two media have been 
negotiated and implemented.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  print  edition  mainly  represents  a  careful  pruning  of  the 
digital material, especially as pertains to the complex structure 
of the indexes.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One reading process
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  indexes  were  built  upon  the  marked-up  ﬁ ne  rolls  texts 
and generated from an ontological framework (Ciula, Spence, 
Vieira,  &  Poupeau;  2007).  The  latter,  developed  through 
careful analysis by scholars and digital humanities researchers, 
constitutes  a  sort  of  an  a  posteriori  system  that  represents 
familial  networks,  professional  relationships,  geo-political 
structures, thematic clusters of subjects, and in general various 
types  of  associations  between  the  13th  century  documents 
(the so called Fine Rolls) and the the roles played by places 
and people in connection with them.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ontology is used to produce a series of pre-coordinate 
axes (the indices) that the reader can follow to explore the 
texts. The ﬂ exibility of the ontology allows the texts to be fairly 
exhaustively  indexed,  just  as  the  presentational  capabilities 
of the digital medium allow for the display and navigation of 
indexes that are correspondingly large.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By  contrast,  the  print  edition  had  to  follow  the  reﬁ ned 
conventions  of  a  well  established  scholarly  tradition  in 
publishing  editions  in  general  and  calendar  [2]  editions  in 
particular, both in terms of formatting and, more importantly 
for us, in terms of content selection/creation and modelling.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Though  the  indices  within  the  printed  edition  are  also  pre-
coordinate axes along which to explore the text, the way in 
which  they  are  produced  is  perceived  to  be  a  nuanced  and 
intuitive  aspect  of  the  scholarship  and  one  that  revealed 
itself  to  be  less  tolerant  to  change.This,  coupled  with  the 
presentational  constraints  of  the  printed  medium  result  in 
indices that present information succinctly and with a minimum 
of  conceptual  repetition.  Similarly,  the  ﬁ rst  print  volume  of 
around 560 pages gives absolute prominence -something that 
can be stated much more strongly in a linear publication than 
in a digital one- to a long and detailed historical introduction, 
followed by a section on the adopted editorial strategies.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>However,  the  two  artefacts  of  the  project  also  share  many 
points in common, either because the digital medium had to 
mirror the tradition of its more authoritative predecessor, or 
for more practical -nevertheless not to be dismissed- reasons 
of  work-ﬂ ow  and  foreseen  usage.  An  interesting  example 
of  the  latter  is  the  adopted  layout  of  footnotes,  where  the 
print  format  was  modelled  on  the  base  of  the  digital  layout 
and,  although  it  was  a  completely  unusual  arrangement,  was 
accepted as suitable by the publisher.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On the base of the work done so far and on the feedback on 
the use of the book and the website, the presentational format 
will be reﬁ ned further for future print volumes to come and 
for the additional material to be included in the digital edition 
before the end of the project.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On the methodological side, we believe that further research 
into the usage and reading process of these parallel publications 
could lead towards a better understanding of scholarly needs 
and therefore a better modelling of such a dual product that 
is becoming a more and more common deliverable in digital 
humanities projects.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As  this  paper  will  exemplify,  the  presentation  of  data  needs 
to  be  tailored  to  take  into  account  the  more  or  less  ﬁ ne 
conventions  of  two  different  media  which  have  different 
traditions,  different  life  cycles,  different  patterns  of  use  and, 
possibly, different users.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>However,  although  very  different  in  nature,  these  two 
publications  are  not  necessarily  perceived  and  –  more 
importantly- used as separate resources with rigid boundaries 
between them. For a scholar interested in the ﬁ ne rolls, the 
reading of the edition and the seeking of information related 
to it (persons, places, subjects and any other interesting clue to 
its historical study in a broader sense) is a global process that 
does not stop when the book is closed or the the browser 
shut. We believe that, when supported by a deep interest in 
the material, the connection between the two publications is 
created in a rather ﬂ uid manner.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  reality  of  the  reading  process  and  information  seeking, 
as  it  happens,  is  inﬂ uenced  by  the  products  it  investigates, 
but ultimately has a form of its own that is different from the 
objects of analysis. It is dynamic and heterogeneous, it leaves on 
the integration between different types of evidence, no matter 
what their format is, including other kind of external sources. 
Indeed, the library or archive is the most likely environment 
where a scholar of the ﬁ ne rolls would ﬁ nd herself browsing 
the  print  or  digital  edition,  eventually  the  original  primary 
sources  or  their  digital  images,  plus  any  range  of  secondary 
sources.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Studying the integration of print and 
digital
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  data  behind  the  two  publications  are  drawn  from  the 
same informational substrate, but are separated to create two 
presentational artefacts. As established, reading is expected to 
be  the  primary  activity  performed  using  both  and  a  stated 
design goal for the project is that the two artefacts will form 
a  rich  body  of  materials  with  which  to  conduct  historical 
research.The heterogeneity of the materials, however, suggests 
that working with texts will of necessity also involve periods 
of  information  seeking:  moments  while  reading  that  give  rise 
to  questions  which  the  material  at  hand  cannot  answer  and 
the  subsequent  process  embarked  upon  in  order  to  answer 
them. Our working hypothesis is that to ﬁ ll these information 
gaps (Wilson, 1999), the reader will turn to particular texts in 
the alternative medium to ﬁ nd answers, moving between the 
website and the books, ﬂ uctuating between states of reading 
and seeking.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Thus, the analytical stream in this paper will move from the 
practices  of  creating  two  types  of  resources  to  establishing 
an analytical framework for evaluating their use. Situating the 
project materials and domain experts within the literature of

(Wilson, 1999) reading within the individual media.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Based on our experience in creating a hybrid edition for the

for the two types of published resources are a starting point 
from which to reﬂ ect on the integrated production of a dual 
object. At  the  same  time,  continuing  work  begun  elsewhere 
in  the  digital  humanities  (Buchanan,  Cunningham,  Blandford, 
Rimmer,  & Warwick;  2006)  to  adapt  methodologies  used  in 
Information Science and Book Studies, a rationale and method 
for the design of an analysis of their use and, in particular, of 
the interaction between scholars and the website/books can 
be outlined.

capturing signals and secret 
messages in a media-rich 
experience

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Argument
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As  libraries  increasingly  undertake  digitisation  projects,  it 
behooves us to consider the collection/capture, organisation, 
preservation, and dissemination of all forms of documentation. 
By implication, then, these forms of documentation go beyond 
written text, long considered the staple of library collections. 
While several libraries have funded projects which acknowledge 
the need to digitise other forms of text, in graphic and audio 
formats,  very  few  have  extended  the  digital  projects  to 
include ﬁ lm, much less performed texts. As more performing 
arts  incorporate  born-digital  elements,  use  digital  tools  to 
create media-rich performance experiences, and look to the 
possibility for digital preservation of the performance text, the 
collection, organisation, preservation, and dissemination of the 
performance event and its artefacts must be considered. The 
ARTeFACT project, underway at the Digital Media Lab at the 
University of Virginia Library, strives to provide a basis for the 
modeling of a collection of performance texts. As the collected 
texts document the creative process both prior to and during 
the  performance  experience,  and,  further,  as  an  integral 
component  of  the  performance  text  includes  the  streaming 
of  data  signals  to  generate  audio/visual  media  elements,  this 
paper  problematises  the  capture  and  preservation  of  those 
data  signals  as  artefacts  contained  in  the  collection  of  the 
media-rich performance event.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Premise
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  a  report  developed  by  a  working  group  at  the  New York 
Public Library, the following participant thoughts are included:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Although  digital  technologies  can  incorporate  ﬁ lmic  ways 
of  perceiving  [the  performing  arts],  that  is  the  tip  of  the 
iceberg. It is important for us to anticipate that there are 
other  forms  we  can  use  for  documentation  rather  than 
limiting ourselves to the tradition of a camera in front of 
the stage. Documentation within a digital environment far 
exceeds the ﬁ lmic way of looking at a performance’ (Ashley 
2005 NYPL Working Group 4, p.5)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>How  can  new  technology  both  support  the  information 
we  think  is  valuable,  but  also  put  it  in  a  format  that  the 
next generation is going to understand and make use of?’ 
(Mitoma 2005 NYPL Working Group 4, p.6)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>These quotes, and many others, serve to point out current issues 
with the inclusion of the documentation of movement-based 
activities in the library repository. Two important library tasks, 
those  of  the  organization  and  dissemination  of  text,  require 
the development of standards for metadata. This requirement 
speaks towards the need for enabling content-based searching 
and dissemination of moving-image collections. However, the 
work being performed to provide metadata schemes of beneﬁ t 
to moving image collections most often refers to (a) a ﬁ lmed 
dramatic  event,  e.g.  a  movie,  and/or  (b)  metadata  describing 
the ﬁ lm itself. Very little research has been completed in which 
the moving image goes beyond a cinematic ﬁ lm, much less is 
considered as one text within a multi-modal narrative.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In an attempt to address these issues, the authors developed 
the ARTeFACT project in hopes of creating a proof-of-concept 
in the University of Virginia Library. Not content, however, to 
study the description of extant, ﬁ lmic and written texts, the 
project  authors  chose  to  begin  with  describing  during  the 
process  of  the  creation  of  the  media-rich,  digital  collection, 
including  the  description  of  a  live  performance  event. The 
decision to document a performance event begged another set 
of answers to questions of issues involved with the collection 
of texts in a multiplicity of media formats and the preservation 
of the artefacts created through a performance event.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Adding to this layer of complexity was the additional decision 
to create not just a multi-media performance, but to create 
one in which a portion of the media was born-digital during 
the event itself. Created from signals transmitted from sensor 
devices  (developed  and  worn  by  students),  the  born-digital 
elements  attain  a  heightened  signiﬁ cance  in  the  description 
of the performance texts. After all, how does one capture the 
data stream for inclusion in the media-rich digital collection?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Methodology
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ARTeFACT project Alpha includes six teams of students 
in an Introductory Engineering Class. Each team was asked to 
design and build an orthotic device that, when worn, causes 
the wearer to emulate the challenges of walking with a physical 
disability  (included  are  stroke ‘drop  foot’  and  paralysis,  CP 
hypertonia, Ricketts, etc.) During the course of the semester, 
the student teams captured pre-event process in a variety of 
digital formats: still and video images of the prototypes from 
cameras and cell phones, PDF ﬁ les, CAD drawings, PowerPoint 
ﬁ les  and  video  documentation  of  those  presentations. The 
digital ﬁ les were collected in a local SAKAI implementation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In addition to these six teams, two other teams were assigned 
the  task  of  developing  wireless  measurement  devices  which, 
when attached to each orthotic device, measures the impact

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  complexity  of  capturing  a  performance  in  which  many 
of the performance elements themselves are created in real 
time,  processed,  and  used  to  generate  audio  visual  feedback 
is  challenging. The  inclusion  of  data  elements  in  the  artefact 
collection begs questions with regard to the means of capturing 
the data without impacting the performance. So, too, does it 
require that we question what data to include: Does it make 
sense to capture the entire data stream or only the elements 
used at a speciﬁ c instance in time to generate the performance; 
what are the implications of developing a sub-system within 
the main performance that captures this information? When 
creating  a  collection  based  on  a  performance  as  digital  text, 
and  before  any  work  may  be  done  to  validate  metadata 
schemes, we must answer these questions. We must consider 
how we capture the signals and interpret the secret messages 
generated as part of the media-rich experience.

then  transmits  the  measurement  data  to  a  computer  that 
feeds  the  data  into  a  Cycling74’s  software  application:  Max/
MSP/Jitter. Jitter, a program designed to take advantage of data 
streams,  then  creates  real-time  data  visualization  as  output. 
The resultant audio visual montage plays as the backdrop to a 
multi-media event that includes student ‘dancers’ performing 
while wearing the orthotic devices.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The sensors generate the data signals from Bluetooth devices 
(each capable of generating up to eight independent signals) 
as well as an EMG (electro-myogram) wireless system. At any 
given  time  there  may  be  as  many  as  seven  signalling  devices 
sending as many as 50 unique data streams into the computer 
for processing. As the sensor data from the performers arrives 
into  Max/MSP/Jitter,  it  is  routed  to  various  audio  and  video 
instruments within the application, processed to generate the 
data visualization, then sent out of the computer via external 
monitor  and  sound  ports.  The  screenshot  below  displays 
visual  representations  of  both  the  input  (top  spectrogram) 
and  output  (bottom:  sonogram)  of  a  real-time  data  stream. 
The data can be visualized in multiple ways; however, the data 
stream as we wish to capture it is not a static image, but rather 
a series of samples of data over time.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There are several options for capturing these signals, two of 
which are: writing the data directly to disk as the performance 
progresses and/or the use of external audio and video mixing 
boards that in the course of capturing can display the mix.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Adding to the complexity, the performance draws on a wide 
variety  of  supporting,  media  rich,  source  material  created 
during the course of the semester. A subset of this material is 
extrapolated for use in the ﬁ nal performance. These elements 
are combined, processed, morphed, and reformatted to ﬁ t the 
genre of the presentation and although they may bear some 
similarity to the original material, they are not direct derivatives 
of  the  source  and  thus  become  unique  elements  in  the 
production. Further, in addition to the capture of data streams, 
the totality of the performance event must be collected. For 
this,  traditional  means  of  capturing  the  performance  event 
have  been  determined  to  be  the  simplest  of  the  challenges 
faced. Therefore,  a  video  camera  and  a  microphone  pointed 
at the stage will sufﬁ ce to ﬁ ll this minimum requirement for 
recording the event.

words. The plays were divided into 2,000 word segments and 
tagged texts were then run through a frequency count using 
Intelligent  Archive  (IA).  A  total  of  563  two-thousand  word 
segments were analysed, 104 of which were from closet plays, 
and 459 from plays written for the public stage. A discriminant 
analysis on the basis of the frequency scores of function words 
demonstrates  that  there  are  signiﬁ cant  differences  between 
the two groups of plays. Table 1 shows the classiﬁ cation results 
for a discriminant analysis using the full set of function words. 
In this test, 561 of the 563 segments were classiﬁ ed correctly. 
One segment from each group was misclassiﬁ ed. Thus 99.6% 
of cross-validated grouped cases were correctly classiﬁ ed on 
the basis of function words alone. The test also showed that 
only 38 of the 241 function word variables were needed to 
successfully discriminate between the groups.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  use  of  computational  methods  of  stylistic  analysis  to 
consider  issues  of  categorization  and  authorship  is  now  a 
widely accepted practice. The use of computational techniques 
to  analyze  style  has  been  less  well  accepted  by  traditional 
humanists. The assumption that most humanists make about 
stylistics  in  general,  and  about  computational  stylistics  in 
particular, is that it is “concerned with the formal and linguistic 
properties of the text as an isolated item in the work” (Clark 
2005). There are, however, two other points of emphasis that 
are brought to bear on a text through a cognitive approach. 
These are: “that which refers to the points of contact between 
a text, other texts and their readers/listeners”, and “that which 
positions  the  text  and  the  consideration  of  its  formal  and 
psychological  elements  within  a  socio-cultural  and  historical 
context” (Clark 2005). Urszula Clark (2005) argues that these 
apparently  independent  strands  of  analysis  or  interpretive 
practice  are  an  “integrated,  indissolvable  package”  (Clark 
2005).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Computational  stylistics  of  the  kind  undertaken  in  this 
study attempts to link statistical ﬁ ndings with this integrated 
indissolvable package; it highlights general trends and features 
that can be used for comparative purposes and also provides 
us with evidence of the peculiarities and creative adaptations 
of an individual user. In this case, the individual user is Elizabeth 
Cary, the author of the earliest extant original play in English by 
a woman, The Tragedy of Mariam, The Fair Queen of Jewry (1613). 
As  well  as  Mariam,  the  set  of  texts  in  the  sample  includes 
the  other  11  closet  tragedies  associated  with  the  “Sidney 
Circle”,  and  48  tragedies  written  for  the  public  stage.  All 
plays in the study were written between 1580 and 1640.1 The 
only other female authored text in the group, Mary Sidney’s 
Antonius, is a translation, as is Thomas Kyd’s Cornelia2.Alexander 
Witherspoon  (1924),  describes  the  Sidnean  closet  tragedies 
as “strikingly  alike,  and  strikingly  unlike  any  other  dramas  in 
English” (179). He attributes this to the extent to which the 
closet writers draw on the work of French playwright Robert 
Garnier as a model for their own writing. In contrast to other 
plays of the period closet tragedies have not attracted much 
in the way of favourable critical attention. They are, as Jonas 
Barish  (1993)  suggests, “odd  creatures”  (19),  and  Mariam  is 
described as one of oddest.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Mariam, as it turns out, is the closet play that is most like a play 
written  for  the  public  stage,  in  terms  of  the  use  of  function 
words.  But  this  isn’t  immediately  obvious.  Some  textual 
preparation was carried out prior to the analysis. Homographs 
were not tagged, but contracted forms throughout the texts

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>components. The scores that produce Figure 3 are “the sum of 
the variable counts for each text segment, after each count is 
multiplied by the appropriate coefﬁ cient” (Burrows and Craig 
1994 68). High counts on word variables at the western end of 
Figure 2 and low counts on word variables at the eastern end 
bring the text segments at the western end of Figure 3 to their 
positions on the graph. The reverse is true for text segments 
on the eastern side of Figure 3. We can see that the far western 
section of Figure 3 is populated predominantly with public play 
segments, and that the eastern side of the y-axis is populated 
exclusively with segments from stage plays. It is clear that in 
the case of these most discriminating variables, the segments 
from Mariam are the closet segments most intermingled with 
the segments written for the public stage.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Looking  at  Figure  2  there  is  evidence  of  an  “emphasis  on 
direct  personal  exchange”  in  western  section  of  the  graph. 
In  the  opposite  section  of  the  graph  there  is  evidence  of  a 
more disquisitory style of language that is “less personal”, with 
“markers of plurality, past time, and a more connected syntax” 
(Burrows and Craig 1994 70). It may be that the results reﬂ ect 
the  kinds  of  observations  that  critics  have  long  made  about 
early modern closet tragedy and tragedy written for the public 
stage, suggesting that “word-counts serve as crude but explicit 
markers of the subtle stylistic patterns to which we respond 
when we read well” (Burrows and Craig 1994 70). It may also 
be the case, however, that we can link these statistical results 
with more interpretive work.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Returning to Mariam, the function words which most distinguish 
the Mariam segments from the rest of the segments of both 
closet  and  public  plays,  are  the  auxiliary  verbs  did  (8.4)  and 
had  (6.9).  In  the  case  of  did  over  500  of  the  segments  have 
scores  of  between  -1  and  2.  Six  of  the  eight  of  the  Mariam 
segments  are  extremely  high  (the  two  middle  segments  of 
Mariam have fairly average z-scores for did). The lowest score 
occurs  in  segment  4,  when  Mariam  is  conspicuously  absent 
from  the  action. A  very  similar  pattern  emerges  for  had.  In 
conventional  grammars  do  and  other  auxiliaries  including  be 
and  have  are  viewed  as  meaningless  morphemes  that  serve 
a  grammatical  purpose.  Langacker  argues  that  serving  a 
speciﬁ able grammatical function is not inherently incompatible 
with being a meaningful element (1987 30).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Cognitive  linguistics  suggests  that  function  word  schemas 
interact  with  each  other  to  produce  what  Talmy  calls  a 
“dotting”  of  semantic  space  (1983  226),  and  that  they “play 
a  basic  conceptual  structuring  role”  (Talmy  88  51).  In  this 
framework,  auxiliaries  are  viewed  as  proﬁ ling  a  process 
–  they  determine  which  entity  is  proﬁ led  by  a  clause  and 
impose a particular construal. Langacker argues, for example, 
that do always conveys some notion of activity or some kind 
of  volitionality  or  control  on  the  part  of  the  subject.  Have 
designates a subjectively construed relation of anteriority and 
current  relevance  to  a  temporal  reference  point  (Langacker 
1991 239). Talmy argues that have can be understood in terms 
of  force  dynamics  patterns;  it “expresses  indirect  causation 
either  without  an  intermediate  volitional  entity…or…  with

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  gives  additional

process  picked  out  54  variables  that  were  signiﬁ cant  at  the 
level of 0.0001 and these 54 variables were used for the PCA. 
PCA  looks  to  deﬁ ne  factors  that  can  be  described  as  most 
responsible for differences between groups. For this text, the 
texts were broken into 4000 word segments to ensure that 
frequencies  remained  high  enough  for  reliable  analysis. This 
produced 268 segments in total (50 closet segments and 218 
public play segments). Figure 2 plots the 54 most discriminating 
words-types  for  the ﬁ rst  two  eigenvectors  (based  on  factor

the “concepts” of force dynamics are “extended by languages 
to  their  semantic  treatment  of  psychological  elements  and

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Machine  learning  tools,  including  document  classiﬁ cation 
and  clustering  techniques,  are  particularly  promising  for 
digital  humanities  because  they  offer  the  potential  of  using 
machines to discover meaningful patterns in large repositories 
of  text.  Given  the  rapidly  increasing  size  and  availability  of 
digital libraries, it is clear that machine learning systems will, 
of necessity, become widely deployed in a variety of speciﬁ c 
tasks  that  aim  to  make  these  vast  collections  intelligible. 
While effective and powerful, machine learning algorithms and 
techniques  are  not  a  panacea  to  be  adopted  and  employed 
uncritically for humanistic research. As we build and begin to 
use them, we in the digital humanities must focus not only on 
the  performance  of  speciﬁ c  algorithms  and  applications,  but 
also on the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of 
these systems.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>and their underlying technical/intellectual assumptions based 
on our experience using them for experimental research.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In many ways, machine learning relies on approaches that seem 
antithetical  to  humanistic  text  analysis  and  reading  and  to 
more general poststructuralist sensibilities. The most powerful 
and  effective  techniques  rely  on  the  abilities  of  systems  to 
classify  documents  and  parts  of  documents,  often  in  binary 
oppositions  (spam/not  spam,  male/female,  etc).  Features  of 
documents employed in machine learning applications tend to 
be restricted to small subsets of available words, expressions 
or other textual attributes. Clustering of documents based on 
relatively  small  feature  sets  into  a  small  and  often  arbitrary 
number of groups similarly tends to focus on broad patterns. 
Lost in all of these operations are the marginal and exceptional, 
rendered  hidden  and  invisible  as  it  were,  in  classiﬁ cation 
schemes and feature selection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Feature set selection is the ﬁ rst necessary step in many text 
mining tasks. Ian Witten notes that in “many practical situations 
there are far too many attributes for learning schemes to handle, 
and  some  of  them  --  perhaps  the  overwhelming  majority  -
-  are  clearly  irrelevant  or  redundant”  (286-7).  In  our  work, 
we routinely reduce the number of features (words, lemmas, 
bigrams, etc) using a variety of techniques, most frequently by 
ﬁ ltering out features which occur in a small subset of documents 
or instances. This selection process is further required to avoid 
“overﬁ tting” a learner to the training data. One could build an 
effective  classiﬁ er  and  train  it  using  features  that  are  unique 
to particular documents, but doing so would limit the general 
applicability of the tool. Attempting to classify French novels by 
gender of author while retaining the names of characters (as 
in Sand’s novel, Conseulo) or other distinctive elements is very 
effective, but says little about gendered writing in 19th century 
France (Argamon et. al., Discourse). Indeed, many classiﬁ cation 
tasks may be successful using a tiny subset of all of the words 
in a corpus. In examining American and non-American Black 
Drama,  we  achieved  over  90%  accuracy  in  classifying  over 
nearly 700 plays using a feature set of only 60 surface words 
(Argamon et. al., Gender, Race). Using a vector space similarity 
function to detect articles in the Encyclopédie which borrow 
signiﬁ cantly from the Dictionnaire de Trévoux, we routinely get 
impressive performance by selecting fewer than 1,000 of the 
400,000  unique  forms  in  the  two  documents  (Allen  et.  al.). 
The requirement of greatly reductive feature set selection for 
practical text mining and the ability of the systems to perform 
effective classiﬁ cations based on even smaller subsets suggests 
that  there  is  a  signiﬁ cant  distance  from  the  texts  at  which 
machine learning must operate in order to be effective.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At the heart of most machine learning tools is some variety 
of  classiﬁ er.  Classiﬁ cation,  however,  is  a  fraught  endeavor  in 
our  poststructuralist  world.  Grouping  things  or  ideas  into 
categories  is  crucial  and  important,  but  doing  so  without 
understanding and being aware of one’s own assumptions is a 
dubious activity, not necessarily for moral, but for intellectual 
reasons. After  all,  hierarchies  and  orders  of  knowledge  have 
been shown to be both historically contingent and reﬂ ections 
of  prevailing  power  structures.  Bowker  and  Star  state  that 
“classiﬁ cation  systems  in  general...  reﬂ ect  the  conﬂ icting, 
contradictory motives of the sociotechnical situations that gave 
rise  to  them”  (64). As  machine  learning  techniques  become 
more widely applied to all forms of electronic text, from the 
WWW to the emerging global digital library, an awareness of 
the  politics  of  classiﬁ cation  and  the  ordering  of  knowledge 
will become ever more important. We would therefore like to 
present a paper outlining our concerns about these techniques

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Given the reductive nature of the features used in text mining 
tasks,  even  the  most  successful  classiﬁ cation  task  tends  to 
highlight  the  lowest  common  denominators,  which  at  best 
may  be  of  little  textual  interest  and  at  worst  extremely 
misleading,  encouraging  stereotypical  conclusions.  Using 
a  decision  tree  to  classify  modern  and  ancient  geography 
articles  in  the  Encyclopédie,  we  found “selon”  (according  to)

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>sources  (“selon  Pline”).  Classiﬁ cation  of  Black  Drama  by 
gender of author and gender of speaker can be very effective 
(80%  or  more  accuracy),  but  the  features  identiﬁ ed  by  the 
classiﬁ ers  may  privilege  particular  stereotypes. The  unhappy 
relationship of Black American men with the criminal justice 
system  or  the  importance  of  family  matters  to  women  are 
both  certainly  themes  raised  in  these  plays.  Of  course,  men 
talk more of wives than women and only women tend to call 
other  women “hussies,”  so  it  is  hardly  surprising  that  male 
and  female  authors/characters  speak  of  different  things  in 
somewhat different ways. However, the operation of classiﬁ ers 
is predicated on detecting patterns of word usage which most 
distinguish  groups  and  may  bring  to  the  forefront  literary 
and  linguistic  elements  which  play  a  relatively  minor  role  in 
the texts themselves. We have found similar results in other 
classiﬁ cation tasks, including gender mining in French literary 
works and Encyclopédie classiﬁ cations.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Machine  learning  systems  are  best,  in  terms  of  various 
measures  of  accuracy,  at  binomial  classiﬁ cation  tasks,  the 
dreaded “binary oppositions” of male/female, black/white and 
so forth, which have been the focus of much critical discussion 
in  the  humanities.  Given  the  ability  of  statistical  learners  to 
ﬁ nd very thin slices of difference, it may be that any operation 
of  any  binary  opposition  may  be  tested  and  conﬁ rmed. 
If  we  ask  for  gender  classiﬁ cation,  the  systems  will  do  just 
that,  return  gender  classiﬁ cations. This  suggests  that  certain 
types  of  hypothesis  testing,  particularly  in  regard  to  binary 
classiﬁ cations, may show a successful result simply based on 
the framing of the question. It is furthermore unclear as to just 
what a successful classiﬁ cation means. If we identify gender or 
race  of  authors  or  characters,  for  example,  at  a  better  than 
80% rate and generate a list of features most associated with 
both sides of the opposition, what does this tell us about the 
failed  20%?  Are  these  errors  to  be  corrected,  presumably 
by  improving  classiﬁ ers  or  clustering  models  or  should  we 
further  investigate  these  as  interesting  marginal  instances? 
What may be considered a failure in computer science could 
be an interesting anomaly in the humanities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Machine  learning  offers  great  promise  to  humanistic  textual 
scholarship  and  the  development  of  digital  libraries.  Using 
systems  to  sift  through  the  ever  increasing  amounts  of 
electronic texts to detect meaningful patterns offers the ability 
to frame new kinds of questions. But these technologies bring 
with them a set of assumptions and operations that should be 
subject to careful critical scrutiny. We in the digital humanities 
must  do  this  critical  work,  relying  on  our  understanding  of 
epistemology and our technical skills to open the black box 
and shine light on what is inside. Deconstruction in the digital 
library  should  be  a  reading  strategy  not  only  for  the  texts 
found  therein,  but  also  of  the  systems  being  developed  to 
manage, control and make the contents of electronic resources 
accessible and intelligible.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Machine learning offers the tantalizing possibility of discovering 
meaningful  patterns  across  large  corpora  of  literary  texts. 
While  classiﬁ ers  can  generate  potentially  provocative  hints 
which may lead to new critical interpretations, the features sets 
identiﬁ ed by these approaches tend not to be able to represent 
the complexity of an entire group of texts and often are too 
reductive  to  be  intellectually  satisfying. This  paper  describes 
our current work exploring ways to balance performance of 
machine  learning  systems  and  critical  interpretation.  Careful 
consideration of feature set design and selection may provide 
literary  critics  the  cues  that  provoke  readings  of  divergent 
classes of texts. In particular, we are looking at lexical groupings 
of feature sets that hold the promise to reveal the predominant 
“idea chunklets” of a corpus.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>due to overﬁ tting” as well as tasks which “have many relevant 
but redundant features... also hurt categorization accuracy”. [Li 
2007]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Feature set design and selection in computer or information 
science is evaluated primarily in terms of classiﬁ er performance 
or  measures  of  recall  and  precision  in  search  tasks.  But  the 
features identiﬁ ed as most salient to a classiﬁ cation task may be 
of more interest than performance rates to textual scholars in 
the humanities as well as other disciplines. In a recent study of 
American Supreme Court documents, McIntosh [2007] refers 
to this approach as “Comparative Categorical Feature Analysis”. 
In our previous work, we have used a variety of classiﬁ ers and 
functions implemented in PhiloMine [1] to examine the most 
distinctive words in comparisons of wide range of classes, such 
as  author  and  character  genders,  time  periods,  author  race 
and ethnicity, in a number of different text corpora [Argamon 
et. al. 2007a and 2007b]. This work suggests that using different 
kinds of features -- surface form words compared to bilemmas 
and bigrams -- allows for similar classiﬁ er performance on a 
selected  task,  while  identifying  intellectually  distinct  types  of 
differences between the selected groups of documents.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Argamon, Horton et al. [Argamon 2007a] demonstrated that 
learners run on a corpus of plays by Black authors successfully 
classiﬁ ed  texts  by  nationality  of  author,  either American  or 
non-American,  at  rates  ranging  between  85%  and  92%. The 
features tend to describe gross literary distinctions between 
the two discourses reasonably well. Examination of the top 30 
features is instructive.

hallway,  nothin,  georgia,  yo’,  naw,  alabama,  git,  outta,  y’,

elders, compound, custom, rude, blasted, quarrel, chop, wives,

palace, forbid, warriors, princess, gods, abroad, politicians
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Text  data  mining  and  machine  learning  applications  are 
dependent  on  the  design  and  selection  of  feature  sets. 
Feature  sets  in  text  mining  may  be  described  as  structured 
data  extracted  or  otherwise  computed  from  running  or 
unstructured text in documents which serves as the raw data 
for a particular classiﬁ cation task. Such features typically include 
words,  lemmas,  n-grams,  parts  of  speech,  phrases,  named 
entities, or other actionable information computed from the 
contents  of  documents  and/or  associated  metadata.  Feature 
set selection is generally required in text mining in order to 
reduce the dimensionality of the “native feature space”, which 
can  range  in  the  tens  or  hundreds  thousands  of  words  in 
even  modest  size  corpora  [Yang].  Not  only  do  many  widely 
used  machine  learning  approaches  become  inefﬁ cient  when 
using such high dimensional feature spaces, but such extensive 
feature  sets  may  actually  reduce  performance  of  a  classiﬁ er.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Compared  side  by  side,  these  lists  of  terms  have  a  direct 
intuitive appeal. The American terms suggest a body of plays 
that deal with the Deep South (the state names), perhaps the 
migration of African-Americans to northern cities (hallway and 
downtown), and also contain idiomatic and slang speech (ya’, 
gon’, git, jive) and the language of racial distinction (colored). The 
non-American terms reveal, as one might expect, a completely 
different  universe  of  traditional  societies  (chief,  elders, 
custom)  and  life  under  colonial  rule  (professor,  corruption, 
politicians). Yet a drawback to these features is that they have a 
stereotypical feel. Moreover, these lists of single terms reduce 
the many linguistically complex and varied works in a corpus 
to a distilled series of terms. While a group of words, in the 
form  of  a  concordance,  can  show  something  quite  concrete 
about  a  particular  author’s  oeuvre  or  an  individual  play,  it  is 
difﬁ cult  to  come  to  a  nuanced  understanding  of  an  entire

lists of single terms do not scale up to provide an adequate 
abstract  picture  of  the  concerns  and  ideas  represented  in  a 
body of works.

features. Running one’s eye down this list is revealing:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Here,  we  see  many  speciﬁ c  instances  of  Africian-American 
experience,  community,  and  locations.  Using  bigrams  instead 
of  bilemmas  delivers  almost  exactly  the  same  classiﬁ er 
performance. However, not all works classiﬁ ed correctly using 
bilemmas  are  classiﬁ ed  correctly  using  bigrams.  Langston 
Hughes, The Black Nativity, for example, is correctly identiﬁ ed as 
American when using bigrams but incorrectly classiﬁ ed when 
using bilemmas. The most salient bigrams in the classiﬁ cation 
task  are  comparable,  but  not  the  same  as  bilemmas.  The 
lemmas of “civil rights” and “human rights” do not appear in 
the top 200 bilemmas for either American or non-American 
features, but appear in bigrams, with “civil rights” as the 124th 
most predictive American feature and “human rights” as 111th 
among non-American features.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>    
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As the example of The Black Nativity illustrates, we have found 
that  different  feature  sets  give  different  results  because,  of 
course,  using  different  feature  sets  means  fundamentally 
changing the lexically based standards the classiﬁ er relies on 
to  make  its  decision.  Our  tests  have  shown  us  that,  for  the 
scholar interested in examining feature sets, there is therefore 
no single, deﬁ nitive feature set that provides a “best view” of 
the  texts  or  the  ideas  in  them. We  will  continue  exploring 
feature  set  selection  on  a  range  of  corpora  representing 
different  genres  and  eras,  including  Black  Drama,  French 
Women Writers, and a collection of American poetry. Keeping 
in mind the need to balance performance and intelligibility, we 
would like to see which combinations of features work best 
on  poetry,  for  example,  compared  to  dramatic  writing. Text 
classiﬁ ers  will  always  be  judged  primarily  on  how  well  they 
group  similar  text  objects.  Nevertheless,  we  think  they  can 
also be useful as discovery tools, allowing critics to ﬁ nd sets of 
ideas that are common to particular classes of texts.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While  information  retrieval  (IR)  and  text  analysis  in  the 
humanities  may  share  many  common  algorithms  and 
technologies, they diverge markedly in their primary objects 
of  analysis,  use  of  results,  and  objectives.  IR  is  designed  to 
ﬁ nd  documents  containing  textual 
information  bearing 
on  a  speciﬁ ed  subject,  frequently  by  constructing  abstract 
representations of documents or “distancing” the reader from 
texts.  Humanistic  text  analysis,  on  the  other  hand,  is  aimed 
primarily at enhancing understanding of textual information as 
a complement of “close reading” of relatively short passages. 
Interpreting a poem, a novel or a philosophical treatise in the 
context of large digital corpora is, we would argue, a constant 
interplay  between  the  estranging  technologies  of  machine 
learning  and  the  direct  reading  of  passages  in  a  work.  A 
signiﬁ cant element of interpreting or understanding a passage 
in  a  primary  text  is  based  on  linking  its  speciﬁ c  elements 
to  parts  of  other  works,  often  within  a  particular  temporal 
framework.  To  paraphrase  Harold  Bloom,  ‘understanding’ 
in  humanistic  textual  scholarship, ‘is  the  art  of  knowing  the 
hidden roads that go from text to text’. [1] Indeed, situating 
a passage of a text in a wider context of an author’s oeuvre, 
time period, or even larger intellectual tradition, is one of the 
hallmarks of textual hermeneutics.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While ﬁ nding the “hidden roads and twisted paths” between 
texts  has  always  been  subject  to  the  limitations  of  human 
reading  and  recollection,  machine  learning  and  text  mining 
offer  the  tantalizing  prospect  of  making  that  search  easier. 
Computers  can  sift  through  ever-growing  collections  of 
primary documents to help readers ﬁ nd meaningful patterns, 
guiding research and mitigating the frailties of human memory. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We believe that a combination of supervised and unsupervised 
machine  learning  approaches  can  be  integrated  to  propose 
various  kinds  of  passages  of  potential  interest  based  on  the 
passage a reader is examining at a given moment, overcoming 
some  limitations  of  traditional  IR  tools.  One-dimensional 
measures  of  similarity,  such  as  the  single  numerical  score 
generated  by  a  vector  space  model,  fail  to  account  for  the 
diverse  ways  texts  interact.  Traditional  ‘ranked  relevancy 
retrieval’  models  assume  a  single  measure  of  relevance  that 
can  be  expressed  as  an  ordered  list  of  documents,  whereas 
real  textual  objects  are  composed  of  smaller  divisions  that 
each  are  relevant  to  other  text  objects  in  various  complex 
ways. Our goal is to utilize the many machine learning tools 
available to create more sophisticated models of intertextual 
relation than the monolithic notion of “similarity.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We plan to adapt various ideas from information retrieval and 
machine learning for our use. Measures of document similarity 
form the basis of modern information retrieval systems, which 
use a variety of techniques to compare input search strings to 
document instances. In 1995, Singhal and Salton[2] proposed 
that vector space similarity measures may also help to identify 
related documents without human intervention such as human-
embedded  hypertext  links. Work  by  James Allan[3]  suggests 
the  possibility  of  categorizing  automatically  generated  links 
using innate characteristics of the text objects, for example by 
asserting the asymmetric relation “summary and expansion” 
based  on  the  relative  sizes  of  objects  judged  to  be  similar. 
Because we will operate not with a single similarity metric but 
with the results of multiple classiﬁ ers and clusterers, we can 
expand  on  this  technique,  categorizing  intertextual  links  by 
feeding all of our data into a ﬁ nal voting mechanism such as a 
decision tree.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our experiments with intertextual discovery began with using 
vector space calculations to try to identify that most direct of 
intertextual relationships, plagiarism or borrowing. Using the 
interactive vector space function in PhiloMine[4], we compared 
the 77,000 articles of the 18th century Encyclopédie of Diderot 
and  d’Alembert  to  the  77,000  entries  in  a  reference  work 
contemporary  to  it,  the  Dictionnaire  universel  françois  et  latin, 
published by the Jesuits in the small town of Trévoux. The Jesuit 
defenders  of  the  Dictionnaire  de Trévoux,  as  it  was  popularly 
known,  loudly  accused  the  Encyclopédists  of  extensive 
plagiarism,  a  charge  Diderot  vigorously  refuted,  but  which 
has  never  been  systematically  investigated  by  scholars.  Our 
procedure is to compare all articles beginning with a speciﬁ c 
letter in the Encyclopédie to all Trévoux articles beginning with 
the same letter. For each article in the Encyclopédie, the system 
displays each Trévoux article that scores above a user-designated 
similarity threshold. Human readers manually inspect possible 
matches, noting those that were probably plagiarized. Having 
completed 18 of 26 letters, we have found more than 2,000 
articles (over 5% of those consulted) in the Encyclopédie were 
“borrowed”  from  the  Dictionnaire  de Trévoux,  a  surprisingly 
large  proportion  given  the  well-known  antagonism  between 
the Jesuits and Encyclopédists.[5]

the reductionist concept of “similarity” that IR has generally 
adopted.  Fortunately,  we  have  a  wide  variety  of  machine 
learning  tools  at  our  disposal  which  can  quantify  different 
kinds  of  relatedness.  By  taking  a  broad  view  of  all  these 
measures, while looking narrowly at smaller segments of texts 
such as paragraphs, we endeavor to design a system that can 
propose speciﬁ c kinds of lower-level intertextual relationships 
that  more  accurately  reﬂ ect  the  richness  and  complexity  of 
humanities  texts. This  kind  of  tool  is  necessary  to  aid  the 
scholar in bridging the gap between the distant view required 
to manipulate our massive modern text repositories, and the 
traditional close, contextual reading that forms the backbone 
of humanistic textual study.

Text Technology.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Encyclopédie  experiment  has  shown  us  strengths  and 
weaknesses  of  the  vector  space  model  on  one  speciﬁ c  kind 
of  textual  relationship,  borrowing,  and  has  spurred  us  to 
devise  an  expanded  approach  to  ﬁ nd  additional  types  of 
intertextual  links. Vector  space  proves  to  be  very  effective 
at ﬁ nding textual similarities indicative of borrowing, even in 
cases  where  signiﬁ cant  differences  occur  between  passages. 
However, vector space matching is not as effective at ﬁ nding 
articles  borrowed  from  the  Trévoux  that  became  parts  of 
larger  Encyclopédie  articles,  suggesting  that  we  might  proﬁ t 
from  shrinking  the  size  of  our  comparison  objects,  with 
paragraph-level objects being one obvious choice. In manually 
sifting through proposed borrowings, we also noticed articles 
that  weren’t  linked  by  direct  borrowing,  but  in  other  ways 
such  as  shared  topic,  tangential  topic,  expansion  on  an  idea, 
differing take on the same theme, etc. We believe that some 
of these qualities may be captured by other machine learning 
techniques.  Experiments  with  document  clustering  using 
packages such as CLUTO have shown promise in identifying 
text  objects  of  similar  topic,  and  we  have  had  success  using 
naive Bayesian classiﬁ ers to label texts by topic, authorial style 
and  time  period.  Different  feature  sets  also  offer  different 
insights,  with  part-of-speech  tagging  reducing  features  to  a 
bare,  structural  minimum  and  N-gram  features  providing  a 
more  semantic  perspective.  Using  clustering  and  classiﬁ ers 
operating  on  a  variety  of  featuresets  should  improve  the 
quality  of  proposed  intertextual  links  as  well  as  a  providing 
a  way  to  assign  different  types  of  relationships,  rather  than 
simply labeling two text objects as broadly similar.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>      
 
   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  test  our  hypothesis,  we  will  conduct  experiments  linking 
Encyclopédie articles to running text in other contemporaneous 
French  literature  and  reference  materials  using  the  various 
techniques  we  have  described,  with  an  emphasis  on 
intelligently synthesizing the results of various machine learning 
techniques to validate and characterize proposed linkages. We 
will  create  vector  representations  of  surface  form,  lemma, 
and  ngram  feature  sets  for  the  Encyclopédie  and  the  object 
texts  as  a  pre-processing  step  before  subjecting  the  data 
to  clustering  and  categorization  of  several  varieties.  Models 
trained on the Encyclopédie will be used to classify and cluster 
running text, so that for each segment of text we will have a 
number  of  classiﬁ cations  and  scores  that  show  how  related 
it is to various Encyclopédie articles and classes of articles. A 
decision  tree  will  be  trained  to  take  into  account  all  of  the 
classiﬁ cations  and  relatedness  measures  we  have  available, 
along with innate characteristics of each text object such as 
length,  and  determine  whether  a  link  should  exist  between 
two give text objects, and if so what kind of link. We believe 
a decision tree model is a good choice because such models 
excel at generating transparent classiﬁ cation procedures from 
low dimensionality data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  toolbox  that  we  have  inherited  or  appropriated  from 
information  retrieval  needs  to  be  extended  to  address 
humanistic  issues  of  intertextuality  that  are  irreducible 
to  single  numerical  scores  or  ranked  lists  of  documents.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A novel way for the 
comparative analysis 
of adaptations based 
on vocabulary rich text 
segments: the assessment of 
Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code 
and its translations 
 Maria Csernoch  
mariacsernoch@hotmail.com
University of Debrecen , Hungary 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this work the appearance of the newly introduced words 
of  The  Da Vinci  Code  and  its  different  translations  have  been 
analyzed and compared. The concept “newly introduced words” 
refers to the words whose ﬁ rst appearance is detected at a 
certain point of the text. In general the number of the newly 
introduced words follows a monotonic decay, however, there 
are segments of the texts where this descending is reversed 
and  a  sudden  increase  is  detectable  (Csernoch,  20066a, 
2006b, 2007) – these text slices are referred to as vocabulary 
rich  text  slices. The  question  arises  whether  the  detectable, 
unexpectedly high number of newly introduced words of the 
original work is traceable in the different translations of the 
text or not.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Before advancing on the project let us deﬁ ne the concept of 
translation. In this context the deﬁ nition of Hatim and Mason 
(1993)  is  accepted,  that  is  any  adaptation  of  a  literary  work 
is  considered  as  translation.  Beyond  the  foreign  language 
translations  of  The  Da Vinci  Code  two  more  adaptations,  the 
lemmatized and the condensed versions of the original work 
were analyzed.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  comparison  of  the  newly  introduced  word  types  and 
lemmas  of  the  different  translations  allows  us  to  trace  how 
precisely translation(s) follow(s) the changes in the vocabulary 
of the original text. Whether the vocabulary rich sections of 
the original text appear similarly rich in the translations, or the 
translations  swallow  them  up,  or  the  translations  are  richer 
at certain sections than the original work. In addition, could 
the changes in the newly introduced words, as an additional 
parameter to those already applied, be used to give a hint of 
the quality of a translation?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  carry  out  the  analysis  a  previously  introduced  method 
was  applied  (Csernoch,  2006a,  2006b). The  text  was  divided 
into  constant-length  intervals,  blocks.  The  number  of  the 
newly  introduced  words  was  mapped  to  each  block. Those 
text segments were considered vocabulary rich, in which the 
number of the newly introduced words signiﬁ cantly exceeds 
that predicted by a ﬁ rst-order statistical model.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The original The Da Vinci Code
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In the original The Da Vinci Code eleven signiﬁ cant, vocabulary 
rich, text slices were detected. This number is similar to what 
was  found  in  other,  previously  analyzed  works  (Csernoch, 
2007).  However,  a  further  analysis  of  these  text  slices  was 
applied to reveal their nature. Four parameters,
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>– the distribution of these text slices within the text,
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>– their length – the number of blocks in the signiﬁ cant text 
slice,
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>– their intensity – the local maximum of the relative number 
of the newly introduced words, and
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>– their content were determined.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The majority of the signiﬁ cant text slices of The Da Vinci Code 
both in lengths and intensity turned out to be unusually small, 
containing descriptions of events, characters and places. None 
of  them  stands  for  stylistic  changes  which  usually  (Baayen, 
2001)  trigger  extremely  vocabulary  rich  text  slices.  The 
distribution of them is uneven, they mainly appear in the ﬁ rst 
half of the text. This means that the second half of the novel 
hardly introduces any more vocabulary items that predicted 
by a ﬁ rst-order statistical model.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The analysis of the lemmatized texts
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  see  whether  the  word  types,  with  all  their  sufﬁ xes,  are 
responsible  for  any  losses  of  vocabulary  rich  text  slices,  the 
lemmatization, as an adaptation of the text, was carried out. 
As it was found earlier (Csernoch, 2006b), the lemmatization 
of the text produced minor, if any, differences in the analysis 
of  the  word  types  in  an  English  text. To  the  English  non-
lemmatized and lemmatized The Da Vinci Code their Hungarian 
correspondences were compared. Unlike the English texts, at 
the  beginning  of  the  Hungarian  texts  the  number  of  newly 
introduced word types was so high that up to the ﬁ rst two 
hundred blocks (20,000 tokens), some of the text slices with 
signiﬁ cantly  high  number  of  newly  introduced  word  types 
might be swallowed up.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The foreign language translations of 
The Da Vinci Code
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While the absolute numbers of the newly introduced words of 
texts in different languages cannot, their relative numbers can 
be compared using the method outlined in Csernoch (2006a). 
Relying  on  the  advantages  of  the  method  three  different 
translations were compared to the original text, the Hungarian, 
the German, and the French. If the vocabulary rich text slices 
are  found  at  the  same  positions  both  in  the  original  and  in 
the translated text, the translation can then be considered as 
exact in respect of vocabulary richness.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  the  Hungarian  translation  the  lengths  and  the  intensities 
of the vocabulary rich text slices were not altered, however 
their distribution was more even than in the English text, and 
their number increased to sixteen. While the vocabulary rich 
text slices of the English text were all found in the Hungarian 
text,  further  such  text  slices  were  identiﬁ ed  in  the  second 
half of the Hungarian text. The comparison revealed that the 
Hungarian text is richer in vocabulary than the English text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  German  translation  replicated  the  vocabulary  rich  text 
slices  of  the  original  English  text,  and  provided  ﬁ ve  more, 
which, similarly to the Hungarian translation, means that these 
text  slices  are  richer  in  vocabulary  than  the  corresponding 
text slices in the English text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>to  one-third,  which  is  a  notable  difference  compared  to  the 
full-length  Hungarian  text.  Both  in  the  condensed  English 
and  Hungarian  texts  the  vocabulary  rich  segments  were 
concentrated  to  the  ﬁ rst  half  of  the  texts  representing  the 
same events, none of the segments unique to the full-length 
Hungarian text appeared in the condensed Hungarian text. The 
cumulative length of the vocabulary rich text slices dropped 
to 51% in the English and to 43% in the Hungarian text. Again, 
the Hungarian text seemed to be damaged to a greater extent. 
All the analyzed parameters thus clearly indicate that for the 
condensed Hungarian version the condensed English text was 
the direct source.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Bibliography
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In the French translation only nine signiﬁ cant text slices were 
found. All of these text slices were only one block long, and 
their intensities were also surprisingly small. This means that 
the distribution of the newly introduced words in the French 
translation  hardly  differs  from  that  predicted  by  the  model. 
Furthermore,  they  are  quite  different  in  content  from  the 
vocabulary rich text slices in the other languages. Thus, there 
are hardly any concentrated, vocabulary rich text slices in the 
French text.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Finally, the condensed versions of the English and Hungarian 
texts  were  compared  to  the  corresponding  full-length  text 
and  to  each  other.  Several  questions  are  to  be  answered  in 
this context. By the nature of this adaptation it is obvious that 
the length of the text is curtailed to some extent. However, 
this  parameter  does  not  tell  much  about  the  nature  of  the 
condensation. We do not know from this parameter whether 
the  condensation  is  only  a  cropping  of  the  original  text  – 
certain text segments are left out while others are untouched 
–  or  the  whole  text  is  modiﬁ ed  to  some  extent.  If  the  text 
is  modiﬁ ed,  the  percentage  of  the  remaining  tokens,  word 
types, lemmas, and hapax legomena are parameters which tell 
us more about the condensation. To get a further insight it is 
worth considering how the vocabulary rich text segments of 
the original text are transferred into the condensed text. This 
last parameter might be a great help in deciding from which 
ﬁ rst order adaptation a second order adaptation of a text – in 
this case the condensed Hungarian text – is derived.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> 
 
   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Both the English and the Hungarian condensed texts are 45% 
of  the  original  texts  in  length. The  number  of  word  types  is 
64  and  55%,  the  number  of  lemmas  are  64  and  61%,  while 
the number of hapax legomena is 70 and 56% of the English 
and Hungarian full-length texts, respectively. These parameters 
indicate that the Hungarian condensed text bore more serious 
damage than the English did. The number of vocabulary rich 
text segments dropped to six – somewhat more than the half 
of original number – in the English text. On the other hand, the 
number of these text segments in the Hungarian text dropped

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Converting St Paul: A new 
TEI P5 edition of  The 
Conversion of St Paul using 
stand-off linking 
 James C. Cummings 
James.Cummings@oucs.ox.ac.uk
 University of Oxford  , UK
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In researching the textual phenomena and scribal practices of 
late-medieval drama I have been creating an electronic edition 
of The  Conversion  of  St  Paul. This  late-medieval  verse  play 
survives only in Bodleian MS Digby 133. My edition attempts 
to be a useful scholarly work, which where possible leverages 
existing resources to create an agile interoperable resource. 
In undertaking this work I have been able to explore a number 
of issues related to the creation of such editions which may 
have pedagogic beneﬁ t as a case study to others. These include 
shortcuts to speed up the creation of the initial edition, the 
generation  of  additional  resources  based  solely  on  a  single 
XML  encoded  text,  the  use  of  new  mechanisms  in  the TEI 
P5  Guidelines,  and  the  exploitation  of  stand-off  markup  to 
experiment with seamlessly incorporating external resources. 
The TEI  P5  Guidelines  have  been  followed  in  production  of 
this edition, and speciﬁ cally I have used a number of features 
which are new additions to TEI P5 and which others may not 
yet be familiar. It was developed in tandem with early drafts of 
the Guidelines, in part to test some of the features we were 
adding.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>These include:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• A customised view of the TEI expressed as a TEI ODD ﬁ le. 
This allows generation not only of constrained TEI Schemas 
and DTDs but also project speciﬁ c documentation through 
the TEI’s ODD processor ‘Roma’.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• A manuscript description of MS Digby 133, and the 
manuscript item of this play, using the TEI’s new module for 
manuscript description metadata.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Consistent and in-depth use of the new <choice> 
structure to provide alternative textual information at 
individual points in the text. Speciﬁ cally, in this highly-
abbreviated medieval text, this has been used to provide 
both abbreviations and expansions which then can be 
toggled in the rendered version. Regularisation of medieval 
spelling has been handled with stand-off markup, but could 
equally have been incorporated into <choice>
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• The edition also records information about the digital 
photographic surrogate provided by the Bodleian using the 
new <facsimile> element. While this will also allow linking 
from the text to particular zones of the images, this has not 
yet been undertaken..
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• The edition also uses various new URI-based pointing 
mechanisms and datatype constraints new to TEI P5.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  speed  up  the  creation  of  the  edition  I  took  an  out  of 
copyright  printed  version  of  the  text  (Furnivall  1896)  which 
was scanned and passed through optical character recognition. 
This  was  then  carefully  corrected  and  proofread  letter-by-
letter  against  freely  available  (though  restrictively  licensed) 
images made available online by the Bodleian Library, Oxford 
(at 
http://image.ox.ac.uk/show?collection=bodleian&manu
script=msdigby133).  I  used  OpenOfﬁ ce  to  create  the  initial 
edition,  with  specialised  formatting  used  to  indicate  various 
textual  and  editorial  phenomena  such  as  expanded  material, 
superscript abbreviation markers, stage directions, and notes. 
The up-scaling of the markup through using this presentational 
markup was achieved when I converted it, using XSLT, to very 
basic TEI  XML. While  this  is  a  quick  method  of  data  entry 
familiar  to  many  projects,  it  only  tends  to  work  successfully 
in  non-collaborative  projects  where  the  consistency  of  the 
application of formatting can be more easily controlled as any 
inconsistencies can lead to signiﬁ cant manual correction of the 
generated XML.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Another  of  the  issues  I  was  interested  in  exploring  in 
this  edition  was  the  use  of  stand-off  markup  to  create 
interoperable secondary resources and how this might effect 
the nature of scholarly editing. While I could have stored much 
of this information I needed in the edition itself, I wanted to 
experiment with storing it in external ﬁ les and linking them 
together by pointing into the digital objects. The motivation for 
this comes from a desire to explore notions of interoperability 
since  stand-off  markup  methodology  usually  leaves  the  base 
text untouched and stores additional information in separate 
ﬁ les. As greater numbers of good scholarly academic resources 
increasingly  become  available  in  XML,  the  pointing  into  a 
number of resources, and combining these together to form 
an  additional  greater  resource  is  becoming  more  common. 
Stand-off markup was used here partly to experiment with the 
idea of creating an interoperable ﬂ exible resource, that is an 
‘agile edition’. For example, an edition can be combined with 
associated images, a glossary or word list, or other external 
resources  such  as  dictionaries.  In  the  case  of  this  edition,  I 
generated  a  word  list  (encoded  using  the  TEI  dictionaries 
module)  using  XSLT.  The  word  list  included  any  distinct 
orthographic variants in the edition. This was based on a ‘deep-
equals’ comparison which compared not only the spelling of 
words, but all of their descendant elements, and thus captured 
differences in abbreviation/expansion inside individual words. 
The location of individual instances of orthographic variance 
in  the  edition  could  easily  have  been  stored  along  with  the 
entry in the word list. However, since part of the point was to 
experiment with handling stand-off markup, I stored these in a 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Inside abbreviations and expansions, the new elements 
<am> (abbreviation marker) and <ex> (expanded text) 
have been used. This allows the marking and subsequent 
display of abbreviation marks in a diplomatic edition view 
and italicised rendering of the supplied text in the expanded 
view.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>third ﬁ le whose only purpose was to record <link> elements 
pointing  both  to  an  entry  in  the  word  list  and  every  single 
instance of this word in the edition. This linking was done using 
automatically-generated  xml:id  attributes  on  each  word  and 
word  list  entry. This  enables  a  number  of  usability  features. 
The clicking on any individual word in the edition takes you 
to its corresponding entry in the word list. From any entry in 
the word list you can similarly get back to any other individual 
instance of that word in the edition. Moreover the word list 
entry  also  contains  an  optionally  displayed  concordance  of 
that word to allow easy comparison of its use in context.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In addition to using resources created by myself, it was a desired 
aim of this investigation into stand-off markup to use external 
resources. The  most  appropriate  freely-available  resource  in 
this case is the Middle English Dictionary (MED), created by 
the University of Michigan. As this scholarly edition was being 
created in my spare time, I did not want to exhaustively check 
orthographic  words  in  my  edition  against  the  MED  and  link 
directly to the correct senses. While that is certainly possible, 
and  should  be  the  recommended  text-critical  practice,  it 
would take a signiﬁ cant amount of time and be prone to error. 
Instead I desired to pass a regularised form of the word to the 
MED  headword  search  engine,  and  retrieve  the  results  and 
incorporate them dynamically into the display of the entry for 
that  word  in  the  word  list.  However,  this  proved  impossible 
to  do  from  the  MED  website  because  their  output,  despite 
claiming  to  be  XHTML,  was  not  well-formed.  Luckily,  they 
were willing to supply me with an underlying XML ﬁ le which 
provided not only headwords, but also their various different 
orthographic forms and the MED id number to which I could 
link  directly. Thus,  I  was  able  to  achieve  the  same  effect  as 
transcluding  the  MED  search  results  by  reimplementing  the 
functionality  of  their  search  directly  in  my  XSLT  and  thus 
providing  pre-generated  links  in  each  entry  to  possible 
headwords in the MED. While successful for my resource, in 
terms of true interoperability it is really a failure, one which 
helps  to  highlight  some  of  the  problems  encountered  when 
pointing into resources over which you have no control.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  proposed  paper  will  describe  the  process  of  creation 
of  the  edition,  the  beneﬁ ts  and  drawbacks  of  using  stand-
off  markup  in  this  manner,  its  linking  to  external  resources, 
and how the same processes might be used in either legacy 
data  migration  or  the  creation  of  new  editions.  One  of  the 
concluding arguments of the paper is that the advent of new 
technologies  which  make  the  longpromised  ability  for  the 
interoperability of resources that much easier, also encourages 
(and is dependent upon) us making our own existing materials 
accessible in a compatible manner.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>ENRICHing Manuscript 
Descriptions with TEI P5 
 James C. Cummings

 University of Oxford  , UK
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>ENRICH  is  a  pan-European  eContent+  project  led  by  the 
Czech  National  Library,  starting  1  December  2007,  which 
is creating a base for the European digital library of cultural 
heritage  (manuscript,  incunabula,  early  printed  books,  and 
archival  papers)  by  the  integration  of  existing  but  scattered 
electronic content within the Manuscriptorium digital library 
through the use of the metadata enrichment and coordination 
between  heterogeneous  metadata  and  data  standards.  The 
consortium brings together critical mass of content, because 
the  project  groups  together  the  three  richest  owners  of 
digitized  manuscripts  among  national  libraries  in  Europe 
(Czech  Republic,  Iceland  and  Serbia  as  associated  partners); 
ENRICH  partner  libraries  possess  almost  85%  currently 
digitized manuscripts in the national libraries in Europe, which 
will be enhanced by substantial amount of data from university 
libraries  and  other  types  of  institutions  in  terms  of  several 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  digitized  pages  plus  hundreds  of 
thousands  of  pages  digitized  by  the  partners  through  the 
European  Library  data  collections.  When  the  project  has 
ﬁ nished  the  consortium  will  make  available  more  than  an 
estimated 5,076,000 digitized pages.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>><http://enrich.manuscriptorium.com/> 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>ENRICH 
builds 
upon  the  existing  Manuscriptorium  platform  <http://www.
manuscriptorium.com/>  and  is  adapting  it  to  the  needs  of 
those  organizations  holding  repositories  of  manuscripts. 
The principle of integration is centralisation of the metadata 
(descriptive  evidence  records)  within  the  Manuscriptorium 
digital  library  and  distribution  of  data  (other  connected 
digital documents) among other resources within the virtual 
net  environment.  That  is,  the  metadata  of  the  manuscript 
descriptions is aggregated in a single place and format to assist 
with searching these disparate repositories, but the images and 
original  metadata  records  remain  with  the  resource-holding 
institutions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>ENRICH target groups are content owners/holders, Libraries, 
museums and archives, researchers & students, policy makers 
and general interest users. The project allows them to search 
and  access  documents  which  would  otherwise  be  hardly 
accessible  by  providing  free  access  to  almost  all  digitized 
manuscripts  in  Europe.  Besides  images  it  also  offers  access 
to  TEI-structured  historical  full  texts,  research  resources, 
other types of illustrative data (audio and video ﬁ les) or large 
images of historical maps. The ENRICH consortium is closely 
cooperating with TEL (The European Library) and will become 
a component part of the European Digital Library when this 
becomes reality.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Manuscriptorium  is  currently  searchable  via  OAI-PMH  from 
the TEL portal, this means that any ENRICH full or associated 
partner  automatically  enriches  the  European  Digital  Library. 
The  main  quality  of  ENRICH  and  Manuscriptorium  is  the 
application of homogeneous and seamless access to widespread 
resources  including  access  to  images  from  the  distributed 
environment  under  a  single  common  interface.  ENRICH 
supports several levels of communication with remote digital 
resources,  ranging  from  OAI  harvesting  of  partner  libraries 
to  full  integration  of  their  resources  into  Manuscriptorium. 
Furthermore,  ENRICH  has  developed  free  tools  to  assist  in 
producing XML structured digitized historical documents, and 
these  are  already  available  and  ready  to  use.  However,  the 
existing  XML  schema  reﬂ ects  the  results  of  the  now-dated 
EU MASTER project for TEI-based manuscript descriptions. It 
also incorporates other modern content standards, especially 
in the imaging area. It is this schema that is being updated to 
reﬂ ect  the  developments  in  manuscript  description  available 
in TEI  P5. The  internal  Manuscriptorium  format  is  based  on 
METS  containerization  of  the  schema  and  related  parallel 
descriptions which enables a ﬂ exible approach needed by the 
disparate practices of researchers in this ﬁ eld.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Research  Technology  Services  section  of  the  Oxford 
University  Computing  Services  is  leading  the  crucial  work-
package on the standardization of shared metadata. In addition 
to a general introduction to the project it is the progress of 
this work-package which the proposed paper will discuss. This 
work-package is creating a formal TEI speciﬁ cation, based on 
the TEI P5 Guidelines, for the schema to be used to describe

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>to perform this harvesting are also being developed. Eventually, 
the internal environment of Manuscriptorium will be enhanced 
through  implementation  of  METS  containerization  of  the 
Manuscriptorium  Scheme.  This  will  involve  an  assessment 
of  the  respective  roles  of  the  TEI  Header  for  manuscript 
description  and  of  a  METSconformant  resource  description 
and  will  enable  different  kinds  of  access  to  the  resources 
within the Manuscriptorium. This will help to demonstrate for 
others the interoperability of these two important standards, 
and in particular where their facilities are complementary.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Improvement  and  generalization  of  Unicode  treatment  in 
Manuscriptorium  is  the  ﬁ nal  part  of  the  OUCS-led  work 
package.  As Manuscriptorium is basically an XML system, all the 
data managed is necessarily represented in Unicode. This could 
cause  problems  for  materials  using  non-standard  character 
encodings, 
for  example  where  manuscript  descriptions 
quote from ancient scripts and include glyphs not yet part of 
Unicode. The TEI recommendations for the representation of 
nonstandard  scripts  are  being  used  within  ENRICH  project 
which is producing a suite of non-standard character and glyph 
descriptions appropriate to the project’s needs.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  proposed  paper  is  intended  as  a  report  on  the  work 
done  in  the  conversion  and  rationalization  of  manuscript 
metadata  across  a  large  number  of  archives  with  disparate 
practices.  While  it  will  introduce  the  project  to  delegates 
at  Digital  Humanities  2008,  it  will  concentrate  on  reporting 
the  the  problems  and  successes  encountered  in  the  course 
of these aspects of project. Although the overall project will 
not  be  ﬁ nished  by  the  time  of  the  conference,  the  majority 
of the work in developing a suite of conversion tools will be 
complete by this time and the paper will focus on this work. 
As such, although it will detail work done by the author, it will 
rely on work by project partners who although not listed as 
authors here will be brieﬂ y acknowledged in the paper where 
appropriate.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>manuscripts  managed  within  Manuscriptorium.  The  use  of 
this  speciﬁ cation  enables  automatic  generation  of  reference 
documentation  in  different  languages  and  the  creation  of  a 
formal DTD or Schemas as well as formal DTD or Schemas. A 
suite of tools is also being developed to convert automatically 
existing sets of manuscript descriptions, where this is feasible, 
and to provide simple methods of making them conformant 
to  the  new  standard  where  it  is  not. These  tools  are  being 
developed  and  validated  against  the  large  existing  base  of 
adopters of the Master standard and will be distributed free 
of charge by the TEI.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  proposed  paper  will  report  on  the  development  and 
validation  of  a TEI  conformant  speciﬁ cation  for  the  existing 
Manuscriptorium  schema  using  the  TEI  P5  speciﬁ cation 
language (ODD). This involved a detailed examination of the 
current schema and documentation developed for the existing 
Manuscriptorium repository and its replacement by a formal 
TEI speciﬁ cation. This speciﬁ cation will continue to be further 
enhanced in light of the needs identiﬁ ed by project participants 
and the wider MASTER community to form the basis of a new 
schema and documentation suite. The paper will report on the 
project’s production of translations for the documentation in 
at least English, French, Czech, German, as well as schemas to 
implement it both as DTD and RELAXNG. The production of 
these schemas and the translated documentation are produced 
automatically from the TEI ODD ﬁ le.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A meeting of representatives from other European institutions 
who  have  previously  used  the  MASTER  schema  has  been 
organized  where  the  differences  in  how  they  have  used  the 
schema  will  have  been  explored,  along  with  their  current 
practice for manuscript description. The aim is to validate both 
the coverage of the new speciﬁ cation and the feasibility and 
ease of automatic conversion towards it. The outputs from this 
activity will include a report on any signiﬁ cant divergence of 
practice amongst the sample data sets investigated. The ODD 
speciﬁ cation  will  continue  to  be  revised  as  necessary  based 
on  the  knowledge  gained  from  the  consultation  with  other 
MASTER users. This will help to create an enriched version of 
the preliminary speciﬁ cations produced. Finally, software tools 
are being developed to assist in conversion of sets of records 
produced  for  earlier  MASTER  speciﬁ cations,  and  perhaps 
some  others,  to  the  new TEI  P5  conformant  schema. These 
tools are being tested against the collection of datasets gained 
from  the  participants  of  the  meeting  with  other  MASTER 
users, but also more widely within the TEI community. OUCS 
is  also  preparing  tutorial  material  and  discussion  papers  on 
the  best  practice  to  assist  other  institutions  with  migration 
existing MASTER material to the new standard. In this subtask 
ENRICH  is  cooperating  with  a  broader TEI-managed  effort 
towards the creation of TEI P5 migration documentation and 
resources.

Scholarly Editions out of the 
Box 
 Alexander Czmiel

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  For  the  most  part,  digital  scholarly  editions  have  been 
historically grown constructs. In most cases, they are oriented 
toward print editions, especially if they are retro-digitized. But 
even “digital-born” editions often follow the same conventions 
as  printed  books. A  further  problem  is  that  editors  start  to 
work on a scholarly edition without enough previous in-depth 
analysis  about  how  to  structure  information  for  electronic 
research. In the course of editing and the collection of data, the 
requirements and wishes of how the edited texts should be 
presented frequently changes, especially when the editor does 
not have a chance to “see” the edition before it is complete. 
Usually all the data is collected, the text is edited and the last 
step is to think about the different presentation formats.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One of the ﬁ rst steps in the production of a digital scholarly 
edition should be to analyze what kind of information might 
be  of  interest  to  a  broad  audience,  and  how  this  should 
be  structured  so  that  it  can  be  searched  and  displayed 
appropriately. The crucial point in the process of designing the 
data structure should be that different scholars have different 
intellectual requirements from resources. They are not always 
happy with how editors organize scholarly editions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Michael  Sperberg-McQueen  demanded  in  1994,  “Electronic 
scholarly  editions  should  be  accessible  to  the  broadest 
audience possible.”[1] However, current scholarly editions are 
produced for a certain audience with very specialized research 
interests. The  great  potential  of  a  digital  scholarly  edition  is 
that it can be designed ﬂ exibly enough to meet the demands 
of people with many different viewpoints and interests. So why 
not let the audience make the decision as to which information 
is  relevant  and  which  is  not?  Some  information  might  be  of 
more interest, other information of less interest or could be 
entirely ignorable.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Imagine a critical scholarly edition about medicine in ancient 
Greece  provided  by  editors  with  a  philological  background. 
A philologist has different needs relating to this edition than, 
e.g., a medical historian, who might not be able to read Greek 
and might be only interested in reading about ancient medical 
practices. Who  knows  what  kinds  of  annotations  within  the 
text are of interest for the recipients?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  have  to  think  about  how  we  can  use  these  beneﬁ ts  to 
establish  a  (perhaps  formalized)  workﬂ ow  to  give  scholars 
the chance to validate their work while it is in progress and 
to present their work in progress in an appropriate way for 
discussion  within  a  community. This  would  not  just  validate 
the technical form of the work, but also improve the quality of 
the content, often due to ongoing feedback, and improve the 
intellectual beneﬁ ts.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On the other hand, digital editions should be brought online 
in  an  easy  way  without  weeks  of  planning  and  months  of 
developing software that may ﬁ t the basic needs of the editors 
but  in  most  cases  is  just  re-inventing  the  wheel.  If  needed, 
digitized images should be included easily and must be citeable. 
As it might be about work in progress, all stages of work must 
be  saved  and  documented. Therefore,  a  versioning  system  is 
needed that allows referencing of all work steps.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Finally, it is necessary that the scholar is able to check his or 
her work viewed in various media by the click of a button - for 
example, how the edition looks like on screen or printed, or 
even with different layouts or website designs.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>What is the potential of such a system? It offers an easy way 
to present the current state of a work in progress. Scholars 
can check their work at any time. But this is not useful without 
modiﬁ cations for the special needs of certain digital editions 
and special navigation issues. Nevertheless, it can be used as 
base system extensible by own scripts, which implement the 
needs of a concrete project.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>And last but not least, such a system should offer the possibility 
of re-using data that is based on the same standard for other 
projects. This is especially true for more formalized data, such 
as biographical or bibliographical information, which could be 
used across different projects that concern the same issue or 
the same period.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper will give a practical example of what an architecture 
that  follows  the  aforementioned  demands  would  look  like. 
This  architecture  gives  scholars  the  possibility  of  producing 
a  scholarly  edition  using  open  standards. The  texts  can  be 
encoded  directly  in  XML  or  using WYSIWYG-like  methods, 
such as possible with the oXygen XML editor or WORD XML 
exports.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  “Scalable  Architecture  for  Digital  Editions”  (SADE) 
developed  at  the  Berlin-Brandenburg  Academy  of  Sciences 
and Humanities is a modular and freely scalable system that 
can be adapted by different projects that follow the guidelines 
of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)[2] or easily use other XML 
standards as input formats. Using the TEI is more convenient, 
as less work in the modiﬁ cation of the existing XQuery and 
XSLT scripts needs to be done.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  digital  world  provides  us  with  many  possibilities  to 
improve scholarly editions, such as almost unlimited space to 
give  complete  information,  more  ﬂ exibility  in  organizing  and 
presenting information, querying information, instant feedback 
and a range of other features.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Scalability  of  SADE  relates  to  the  server  side  as  well  as  to 
the browser side. Browser-side scalability is equivalent to the 
users’ needs or research interests. The user is able to arrange 
the information output as he or she likes. Information can be 
switched on or off. The technological base for this functionality 
is AJAX or the so-called Web 2.0 technologies.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Server-side  scalability  is  everything  that  has  to  do  with 
querying the database and transforming the query results into 
HTML  or  PDF. As  eXist[3],  the  database  we  use,  is  a  native 
XML database, the whole work can be done by XML-related 
technologies such as XQuery and XSLT. These scripts can be 
adapted with less effort to most projects’ needs.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For the connection between text and digitized facsimile, SADE 
uses Digilib[4], an open-source software tool jointly developed 
by  the  Max-Planck-Insitute  for  the  History  of  Science,  the 
University  of  Bern  and  others.  Digilib  is  not  just  a  tool  for 
displaying images, but rather a tool that provides basic image 
editing functions and the capability of marking certain points 
in the image for citation. The versioning system at the moment 
is still a work in progress, but will be available by conference 
time.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Documents can be queried in several ways - on the one hand 
with  a  standard  full  text  search  in  texts  written  in  Latin  or 
Greek letters, and on the other hand by using a more complex 
interface  to  query  structured  elements,  such  as  paragraphs, 
names,  places,  the  apparatus,  etc. These  query  options  are 
provided  by  SADE.  Furthermore,  all  XML  documents  are 
available  not  rendered  in  raw  XML  format,  and  so  can  be 
integrated in different projects rendered in a different way.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>SADE could be the next step in improving the acceptance of 
digital editions. Texts are accessible in several ways. The editor 
decisions are transparent and comprehensible at every stage 
of work, which is most important for the intellectual integrity 
of a scholarly edition. The digitized facsimiles can be referenced 
and therefore be discussed scientiﬁ cally. The database back end 
is easy to handle and easy to adapt to most projects’ needs.

continually,  is  the  website  of  the  “Corpus  Medicorum

Philosophy Scholars

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia  is  a  distributed  semantic  digital  library  and  publishing 
system,  which  is  speciﬁ cally  designed  for  the  needs  of  the 
scholarly research in the humanities. The system is designed 
for  the  diverging  needs  of  heterogeneous  communities.  It  is 
strictly based on Semantic Web technology1 and computational 
ontologies  for  the  organisation  of  knowledge  and  will  help 
the  deﬁ nition  of  a  state-ofthe-art  research  and  publishing 
environment for the humanities in general and for philosophy 
in particular.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia  is  developed  within  the  Discovery  project,  which  aims 
at  easing  the  work  of  philosophy  scholars  and  researchers, 
making  a  federation  of  distributed  digital  archives  (nodes) 
each of them dedicated to a speciﬁ c philosopher: Pre-Socratic, 
Diogenes  Laertius,  Leibniz,  Nietzsche, Wittgenstein,  Spinoza, 
and others.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Use Case and Requirements
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One  of  the  use  cases  that  Talia  should  satisfy  is  called 
The  Manuscripts  Comparer.The  archive  contains  digital 
reproductions of handwritten manuscripts by one philosopher. 
The scholar wants to browse them like books, navigating by 
chapters and pages. The archive also contains transcriptions of 
the different paragraphs, on which to click to see the correct 
transcription.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Moreover,  the  scholar  is  interested  in  comparing  different 
versions  of  the  same  thought,  placed  by  the  philosopher  in 
different paragraphs of his works, so the scholar needs to ﬁ nd 
all those different versions. Finally, he/she can write his own 
remarks on those paragraphs, so that they are published in the 
archive, after a peer review process.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>From this use case, we can devise some technical requirements 
that drive the design of Talia:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. Making metadata remotely available. The metadata content 
of the archives shall be made available through interfaces 
similar to those of URIQA2, which will allow automated 
agents and clients to connect to a Talia node and ask 
for metadata about a resource of interest to retrieve its 
description and related metadata (e.g., the author, the 
resource type, etc.). This type of services enable numerous 
types of digital contents reuse.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. Querying the system using standard query-languages. It shall 
possible to directly query the distributed archives using the 
SPARQL Semantic Web Query Language. SPARQL provides 
a powerful and standard way to query RDF repositories but 
also enables merging of remote datasets.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. Transformation of encoded digital contents into RDF. The 
semantic software layer shall provide tools to transform 
textually encoded material, for example the transcription of 
manuscripts in TEI3 format, into RDF.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. Managing structural metadata. “Structural” metadata 
describes the structure of a document (e.g., its format, its 
publisher, etc.). It shall be necessary to provide tools to 
manage these kinds of metadata.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>5. Import and exporting RDF data. It shall be important to 
include facilities in Talia to import and export RDF data 
with standard and well know formats like RDF/XML and 
N-Triples.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia should also provide facilities to enrich the content of the 
archives with metadata, whose types and formats depend on 
the kind of source and on the user community which works on 
the data. For example, in some archives, different  versions of 
the same paragraph may exist in different documents. In order 
to allow the users to follow the evolution of that particular 
philosophical  thought,  the  relations  among  these  different 
versions must be captured by the system.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>An Overview of the Talia System
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia  is  a  distributed  semantic  digital  library  system  which 
combines the features of digital archives management with an 
on-line peer-review system.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Talia platform stores digital objects, called sources, which 
are  identiﬁ ed  by  their  unique  and  stable  URI.  Each  source 
represents either a work of a philosopher or a fragment of it 
(e.g., a paragraph), and can have one or more data ﬁ les (e.g., 
images  or  textual  documents)  connected  to  it.The  system 
also stores information about the sources, which can never be 
removed once published and are maintained in a ﬁ xed state. 
Combined with other long-term preservation techniques, Talia 
allows  the  scholars  to  reference  their  works  and  gives  the 
research community immediate access to new content.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The most innovative aspect of Talia is that for the ﬁ rst time, 
at  least  in  the  ﬁ eld  of  humanities,  all  the  interfaces  exposed 
publicly  will  be  based  on  proven  Semantic Web  standards 
enabling data interoperability within the Talia federation, and 
eases the data interchange with other systems. Two additional 
features  of Talia  are  the  highly  customisable  Graphic  User 
Interface (GUI) and the dynamic contextualisation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Intuitively,  a  computational  ontology  is  a  set  of  assumptions 
that  deﬁ ne  the  structure  of  a  given  domain  of  interest  (e.g., 
philosophy), allowing different people to use the same concepts 
to describe that domain. Talia will use computational ontologies 
to  organise  information  about  writings  of  a  philosopher  or 
documents (manuscripts, essays, theses, and so on) of authors 
concerning that philosopher.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Related Work
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia is directly related to the Hyper Platform which was used 
for  the  HyperNietzsche  archive  [1],  a  specialised  solution, 
designed  for  speciﬁ c  needs  of  the  Nietzsche  communities. 
HyperNietzsche  has  a  ﬁ xed  graphical  user  interface,  it  does 
not use Semantic Web technology and it is not adaptable for 
different communities with heterogeneous needs.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia  shares  some  properties  with  other  semantic  digital 
library  systems  like  JeromeDL  [5],  BRICKS  [6],  and  Fedora 
[7]. However, these projects are mostly focused on the back-
end technology and none of them offers a ﬂ exible and highly 
customisable research and publishing system like Talia.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion and Future Work
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia is a novel semantic digital web library system, which aims 
to improve scholarly research in the humanities, in particular 
in the ﬁ eld of philosophy. Thanks to the use of Semantic Web 
technology, Talia represents a very adaptable state-of-the art 
research and publishing system.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ontologies used in Talia are currently being developed by 
Discovery’s content partners, who are in charge of organising 
their contributions. These ontologies will be part of the ﬁ nal 
core Talia application. At the moment, only a ﬁ rst public demo 
version is available5.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Although Talia is currently intended only for philosophy scholars, 
it should be straightforward to adopt it for humanities, with 
the help of suitably developed ontologies. Using dynamic Ruby 
as  programming  language  and  the  RubyOnRails  framework, 
Talia provides an ideal framework for the rapid development 
of customised semantic digital libraries for the humanities.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1: An Example of the Talia User Interface.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  web  interface  framework,  based  on  modular  elements 
called widgets, allows to build GUIs according to requirements 
coming  from  heterogeneous  communities.  Widgets  can  be 
packaged  independently  and  used  as  building  blocks  for 
the  application’s  user  interface.  In  particular,  Talia  provides 
semantic widgets that interact with an RDF Knowledge Base. 
To customise the site’s appearance, it also would be possible 
to add custom HTML rendering templates. Figure 1 shows a 
screenshot of a Talia’s GUI.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  dynamic  contextualisation  provides  a  means  for  data 
exchange  among  different  and  distributed  digital  libraries 
based on the Talia framework. The dynamic contextualisation 
allows a Talia library (node) to share parts of its RDF graph in 
a peer-to-peer network. By using this mechanism, a node may 
notify another node that a semantic link between them exists, 
and  the  other  node  may  use  this  information  to  update  its 
own RDF graph and create a bidirectional connection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talia  uses  computational  ontologies  and  Semantic  Web 
technology to help the creation of a state-of-the-art research 
and  publishing  environment. Talia  will  provide  an  innovative 
and adaptable system to enable and ease data interoperability 
and new paradigms for information enrichment, dataretrieval, 
and navigation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Computational Ontologies
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Ontologies  have  become  popular  in  computer  science  as  a 
means for the organisation of information. This connotation of 
ontology differs from the traditional use and meaning it has in 
philosophy, where ontologies are considered as  A system of 
categories accounting for a certain vision of the world [2]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  thank  Daniel  Hahn  and  Michele  Barbera  for  the  fruitful 
contributions to this paper.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In computer science, the concept of  (computational) ontology 
evolved  from  the  one  ﬁ rst  provided  by  Gruber  [3],  who 
deﬁ ned an ontology as  a speciﬁ cation of a conceptualisation4 
to a more precise one, extracted from Guarino’s deﬁ nitions 
[4]: A computational ontology is  A formal, partial speciﬁ cation 
of a shared conceptualisation of a world (domain).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>    Bootstrapping Classical 
Greek Morphology 
 Helma Dik

University of Chicago, USA
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Richard Whaling
rwhaling@uchicago.edu
University of Chicago, USA
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>    In  this  paper  we  report  on  an  incremental  approach  to 
automated  tagging  of  Greek  morphology  using  a  range  of 
already existing tools and data. We describe how we engineered 
a  system  that  combines  the  many  freely  available  resources 
into a useful whole for the purpose of building a searchable 
database of morphologically tagged classical Greek.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The current state of the art in electronic tools for classical Greek 
morphology is represented by Morpheus, the morphological 
analyzer  developed  by  Gregory  Crane  (Crane  1991).  It 
provides all possible parses for a given surface form, and the 
lemmas from which these are derived. The rich morphology of 
Greek, however, results in multiple parses for more than 50% 
of  the  words  (http://grade-devel.uchicago.edu/morphstats.
html). There are fully tagged corpora available for pre-classical 
Greek (early Greek epic, developed for the ‘Chicago Homer’, 
http://www.library.northwestern.edu/homer/)  and  for  New 
Testament Greek, but not for the classical period.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Disambiguating more than half of our 3 million-word corpus 
by hand is not feasible, so we turned to other methods. The 
central  element  of  our  approach  has  been  Helmut  Schmid’s 
TreeTagger  (Schmid  1994,  1995).  TreeTagger  is  a  Markov-
model based morphological tagger that has been successfully 
applied to a wide variety of languages. Given training data of 
20,000  words  and  a  lexicon  of  350,000  words, TreeTagger 
achieved accuracy on a German news corpus of 97.5%. When 
TreeTagger encounters a form, it will look it up in three places: 
ﬁ rst, it has a lexicon of known forms and their tags. Second, 
it  builds  from  that  lexicon  a  sufﬁ x  and  preﬁ x  lexicon  that 
attempts  to  serve  as  a  a  morphology  of  the  language,  so  as 
to  parse  unknown  words.  In  the  absence  of  a  known  form 
or  recognizable  sufﬁ x  or  preﬁ x,  or  when  there  are  multiple 
ambiguous  parses,  it  will  estimate  the  tag  probabilistically, 
based  on  the  tags  of  the  previous  n  (typically  two)  words; 
this  stochastic  model  of  syntax  is  stored  as  a  decision  tree 
extracted from the tagged training data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Since classical Greek presents, prima facie, more of a challenge 
than  German,  given  that  it  has  a  richer  morphology,  and  is 
a  non-projective  language  with  a  complex  syntax,  we  were 
initially unsure whether a Markov model would be capable of 
performing on Greek to any degree of accuracy. A particular 
complicating factor for Greek is the very large tagset: our full 
lexicon contains more than 1,400 tags, making it difﬁ cult for 
TreeTagger to build a decision tree from small datasets. Czech

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(Hajič  1998)  is  comparable  in  the  number  of  tags,  but  has 
lower rates of non-projectivity (compare Bamman and Crane 
2006:72 on Latin).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Thus, for a ﬁ rst experiment, we built a comprehensive lexicon 
consisting of all surface forms occurring in Homer and Hesiod 
annotated with the parses occurring in the hand-disambiguated 
corpus--a subset of all grammatically possible parses--so that 
TreeTagger  only  had  about  740  different  possible  tags  to 
consider. Given this comprehensive lexicon and the Iliad and 
Odyssey as training data (200,000 words), we achieved 96.6% 
accuracy  for  Hesiod  and  the  Homeric  Hymns  (see  http://
grade-devel.uchicago.edu/tagging.html).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The experiment established that a trigram Markov model was 
in fact capable of modeling Greek grammar remarkably well. 
The  good  results  can  be  attributed  in  part  to  the  formulaic 
nature of epic poetry and the large size of the training data, 
but  they  established  the  excellent  potential  of  TreeTagger 
for  Greek. This  high  degree  of  accuracy  compares  well  with 
state-of-the-art taggers for such disparate languages as Arabic, 
Korean, and Czech (Smith et al., 2005).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Unfortunately, the Homeric data form a corpus that is of little 
use  for  classical  Greek.  In  order  to  start  analyzing  classical 
Greek, we therefore used a hand-tagged Greek New Testament 
as our training data (160,000 words). New Testament Greek 
postdates  the  classical  period  by  some  four  hundred  years, 
and,  not  surprisingly,  our  initial  accuracy  on  a  2,000  word 
sample of Lysias (4th century BCE oratory) was only 84% for 
morphological tagging, and performance on lemmas was weak. 
Computational  linguists  are  familiar  with  the  statistic  that 
turning to out-of-domain data results in a ten percent loss of 
accuracy, so this result was not entirely unexpected.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At  this  point  one  could  have  decided  to  hand-tag  an 
appropriate  classical  corpus  and  discard  the  out-of-domain 
data. Instead, we decided to integrate the output of Morpheus, 
thereby  drastically  raising  the  number  of  recognized  forms 
and possible parses. While we had found that Morpheus alone 
produced  too  many  ambiguous  results  to  be  practical  as  a 
parser,  as  a  lexical  resource  for TreeTagger  it  is  exemplary. 
TreeTagger’s accuracy on the Lysias sample rose to 88%, with 
much improved recognition of lemmas. Certain common Attic 
constructs,  unfortunately,  were  missed  wholesale,  but  the 
decision tree from the New Testament demonstrated a grasp 
of the fundamentals.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While we are also working on improving accuracy by further 
reﬁ ning  the  tagging  system,  so  far  we  have  seen  the  most 
prospects for improvement in augmenting our New Testament 
data with samples from classical Greek: When trained on our 
Lysias sample alone, TreeTagger performed at 96.8% accuracy 
when tested on that same text, but only performed at 88% on 
a new sample. In other words, 2,000 words of in-domain data 
performed no better or worse than 150,000 words of Biblical 
Greek combined with the Morpheus lexicon. We next used a 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>combined training set of the tagged New Testament and the 
hand-tagged  Lysias  sample.  In  this  case,  the TreeTagger  was 
capable of augmenting the basic decision tree it had already 
extracted from the NT alone with Attic-speciﬁ c constructions. 
Ironically, this system only performed at 96.2% when turned 
back on the training data, but achieved 91% accuracy on the new 
sample  (http://grade-devel.uchicago.edu/Lys2.html  for  results 
on the second sample). This is a substantial improvement given 
the addition of only 2,000 words of text, or less than 2% of 
the total training corpus. In the longer term, we aim at hand-
disambiguating  40,000  words,  double  that  of  Schmid  (1995), 
but comparable to Smith et al. (2005).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  conclude  that  automated  tagging  of  classical  Greek  to 
a  high  level  of  accuracy  can  be  achieved  with  quite  limited 
human effort toward hand-disambiguation of in-domain data, 
thanks to the possibility of combining existing morphological 
data and machine learning, which together bootstrap a highly 
accurate  morphological  analysis.  In  our  presentation  we  will 
report on our various approaches to improving these results 
still further, such as using a 6th order Markov model, enhancing 
the  grammatical  speciﬁ city  of  the  tagset,  and  the  results  of 
several more iterations of our bootstrap procedure.

Gender

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>   This  paper  examines  gendered  language  in  classical  Greek 
drama. Recent years have seen the emergence of data mining in 
the Humanities, and questions of gender have been asked from 
the start. Work by Argamon and others has studied gender in 
English, both for the gender of authors of texts (Koppel et al. 
2002, Argamon et al. 2003) and for that of characters in texts 
(Hota  et  al.  2006,  2007  on  Shakespeare); Argamon  et  al.  (in 
prep. a) study gender as a variable in Alexander Street Press’s 
Black Drama corpus (gender of authors and characters) and 
(in prep. b) in French literature (gender of authors).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Surprisingly, some of the main ﬁ ndings of these studies show 
signiﬁ cant  overlap:  Female  authors  and  characters  use  more 
personal  pronouns  and  negations  than  males;  male  authors 
and  characters  use  more  determiners  and  quantiﬁ ers.  Not 
only, then, do dramatic characters in Shakespeare and modern 
drama,  like  male  and  female  authors,  prove  susceptible  to 
automated  analysis,  but  the  feature  sets  that  separate  male 
from  female  characters  show  remarkable  continuity  with 
those that separate male from female authors.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  a  scholar  of  Greek,  this  overlap  between  actual  people 
and  dramatic  characters  holds  great  promise.  Since  there 
are  barely  any  extant  Greek  texts  written  by  women,  these 
results for English give us some hope that the corpus of Greek 
drama may serve as evidence for women’s language in classical 
Greek.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>After all, if the results for English-language literature showed 
signiﬁ cant  differences  between  male  and  female  characters, 
but  no  parallels  with  the  differences  found  between  male 
and female authors, we would be left with a study of gender 
characterization by dramatists with no known relation to the 
language of actual women. This is certainly of interest from a 
literary and stylistic point of view, but from a linguistic point 
of view, the English data hold out the promise that what we 
learn from Greek tragedy will tell us about gendered use of 
Greek language more generally, which is arguably a question 
of larger import, and one we have practically no other means 
of learning about.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(Republic 3.394-395). Aristophanes, the comic playwright, has 
Euripides boast (Frogs 949f.) that he made tragedy democratic, 
allowing a voice to women and slaves alongside men.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Gender, of course, also continues to fascinate modern readers 
of  these  plays.  For  instance,  Grifﬁ th  (1999:  51)  writes,  on 
Antigone: “Gender lies at the root of the problems of Antigone. 
(...) Sophocles has created one of the most impressive female 
ﬁ gures  ever  to  walk  the  stage.” Yet  there  are  no  full-scale 
studies  of  the  linguistic  characteristics  of  female  speech  on 
the Greek stage (pace McClure 1999).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper, we report our results on data mining for gender 
in Greek drama. We started with the speakers in four plays of 
Sophocles (Ajax, Antigone, Electra, and Trachiniae), for a total of 
thirty characters, in order to test, ﬁ rst of all, whether a small, 
non-lemmatized Greek drama corpus would yield any results 
at all. We amalgamated the text of all characters by hand into 
individual ﬁ les per speaker and analyzed the resulting corpus 
with PhiloMine, the data mining extension to PhiloLogic (http://
philologic.uchicago.edu/philomine).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  initial  experiment,  words  were  not  lemmatized,  and 
only occurrences of individual words, not bigrams or trigrams, 
were  used.  In  spite  of  the  modest  size,  results  have  been 
positive.  The  small  corpus  typically  resulted  in  results  of 
“100%  correct”  classiﬁ cation  on  different  tasks,  which  is  to 
be expected as a result of overﬁ tting to the small amount of 
data. More signiﬁ cantly, results on cross-validation were in the 
80% range, whereas results on random falsiﬁ cation stayed near 
50%. We were aware of other work on small corpora (Yu 2007 
on Dickinson), but were heartened by these positive results 
with PhiloMine, which had so far been used on much larger 
collections.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In our presentation, we will examine two questions in more 
depth, and on the basis of a larger corpus.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>First, there is the overlap found between work on English and 
French. Argamon et al. (2007) laid down the gauntlet:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>“The strong agreement between the analyses is all the more 
remarkable for the very different texts involved in these two 
studies. Argamon et al. (2003) analyzed 604 documents from 
the BNC spanning an array of ﬁ ction and non-ﬁ ction categories 
from a variety of types of works, all in Modern British English 
(post-1960),  whereas  the  current  study  looks  at  longer, 
predominantly  ﬁ ctional  French  works  from  the  12th  -  20th 
centuries. This  cross-linguistic  similarity  could  be  supported 
with further research in additional languages.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There is some contemporary evidence to suggest that Greek 
males considered the portrayal of women on stage to be true 
to life. Plato’s Socrates advises in the Republic against actors 
portraying  women.  Imitation  must  lead  to  some  aspects  of 
these inferior beings rubbing off on the (exclusively male) actors 
_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>So  do  we  ﬁ nd  the  same  tendencies  in  Greek,  and  if  so,  are 
we  dealing  with  human,  or  ‘Western’  cultural,  universals? 
Our  initial  results  were  mixed. When  we  ran  a  multinomial 
Bayes (MNB) analysis on a balanced sample, we did indeed see 
some negations show up as markers for female characters (3 
negations in a top 50 of ‘female’ features; none in the male top 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>50),  but  pronouns  and  determiners  show  up  in  feature  sets 
for both the female and male corpus. An emphatic form of the 
pronoun ‘you’ turned up as the most strongly male feature in 
this same analysis, and two more personal pronouns showed 
up in the male top ten, as against only one in the female top 
ten.  Lexical  items,  on  the  other  hand,  were  more  intuitively 
distributed. Words such as ‘army’, ‘man’, ‘corpse’ and ‘weapons’ 
show up prominently on the male list; two past tense forms of 
‘die’ show up in the female top ten. A larger corpus will allow 
us to report more fully on the distribution of function words 
and  content  words,  and  on  how  selections  for  frequency 
inﬂ uence classiﬁ er results.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Secondly, after expanding our corpus, regardless of whether we 
ﬁ nd similar general results for Greek as for English and French, 
we will also be able to report on variation among the three 
tragedians,  and  give  more  ﬁ ne-grained  analysis.  For  instance, 
in  our  initial  sample,  we  categorized  gods  and  choruses  as 
male  or  female  along  with  the  other  characters  (there  are 
usually indications in the text as to the gender of the chorus 
in a given play, say ‘sailors’, ‘male elders’, ‘women of Trachis’). 
Given the formal requirements of the genre, we expect that it 
will be trivial to classify characters as ‘chorus’ vs. ‘non-chorus’, 
but it will be interesting to see whether gender distinctions 
hold  up  within  the  group  of  choruses,  and  to  what  extent 
divinities  conform  to  gender  roles. The  goddess Athena  was 
the  character  most  often  mis-classiﬁ ed  in  our  initial  sample; 
perhaps this phenomenon will be more widespread in the full 
corpus. Such a ﬁ nding would suggest (if not for the ﬁ rst time, 
of  course)  that  authority  and  gender  intersect  in  important 
ways, even as early as the ancient Greeks’ conceptions of their 
gods.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  conclusion,  we  hope  to  demonstrate  that  data  mining 
Greek drama brings new insights, despite the small size of the 
corpus and the intense scrutiny that it has already seen over 
the centuries. A quantitative study of this sort has value in its 
own  right,  but  can  also  be  a  springboard  for  close  readings 
of  individual  passages  and  form  the  foundation  for  a  fuller 
linguistic and literary analysis.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  world  we  live  in  generates  so  much  data  that  the  very 
structure  of  our  societies  has  been  transformed  as  a  result. 
The way we produce, manage and treat information is changing; 
and the way we present this information and make it available 
raises numerous questions. Is it possible to give information 
an  intuitive  form,  one  that  will  enable  understanding  and 
memory?  Can  we  give  data  a  form  better  suited  to  human 
cognition?  How  can  information  display  enhance  the  utility, 
interest and necessary features of data, while aiding memories 
to  take  hold  of  it?  This  article  will  explore  the  relevance 
of  extracting  and  visualizing  data  within  a  corpus  of  text 
documents  revolving  around  the  theme  of  posthumanism. 
When a large quantity of data must be represented, visualizing 
the information implies a process of synthesis, which can be 
assisted by techniques of automated text document analysis. 
Analysis  of  the  text  documents  is  followed  by  a  process  of 
visualization  and  abstraction,  which  allows  a  global  visual 
metaphoric  representation  of  information.  In  this  article,  we 
will discuss techniques of data mining and the process involved 
in creating a prototype information-cartography software; and 
suggest how information-cartography allows a more intuitive 
exploration  of  the  main  themes  of  a  textual  corpus  and 
contributes to information visualization enhancement.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Is an electronic archive a memory? We must rethink the way 
that we produce and handle information. Can we give it a more 
intuitive  form  that  would  better  lend  itself  to  retention  and 
understanding?  Can  we  better  adapt  it  to  human  cognition? 
How  can  we  extrapolate  narratives  from  databases?  How 
can we insert our memories into this machine memory? The 
answer is simple: by visualizing it.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  the  past  few  years,  the  technical  aspect  of  information 
representation and visualization has been the subject of active 
research which is gaining more and more attention (Card et 
al., 1999; Chen, 1999; Don et al., 2007; Geroimenko and Chen, 
2005;  Perer  and  Shneiderman,  2006;  Spence,  2007).  Despite 
the richness of the work that has been done, there is still a 
glaring lack of projects related to textual analyses, speciﬁ cally of 
literary or theoretical texts, which have successfully integrated 
advances in the ﬁ eld of information visualization.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Objectives
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our  project  is  part  of  this  visual  analytical  effort.  How  can 
we visually represent posthumanism? How can we produce an 
image of its questions and challenges? How can we transform 
the enormous quantity of associated information the concept 
carries into something intuitive? We believe that the creation 
of a thematic map is part of the solution. Why a map? Because 
the  information-driving  suffocation  we  experience  is  also 
our  inability  to  create  cognitive  maps  (as  Fredric  Jameson 
suggested). And so we challenged ourselves to create a map 
of  posthumanism,  one  that  could  be  read  and  understood 
intuitively.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  do  this,  we  have  chosen  to  use  Google  Earth  (GE)  as 
the basic interface for the project. GE’s interface is naturally 
intuitive. It corresponds to our collective imagination and it also 
allows users to choose the density of information they desire. 
GE  allows  the  user  to “dive”  into  the  planet’s  geographical, 
political, and social layers, or to stay on higher, more general 
levels. GE “tells” the story of our way of seeing the world. GE 
shows us the world the way science describes it and political 
maps draw it.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Human  civilization  is  now  confronted  with  the  problem  of 
information overload. How can we absorb an ever-increasing 
quantity of information? How can we both comprehend it and 
ﬁ lter it according to our cognitive tools (which have adapted 
to understand general forms and structures but struggle with 
sequential and cumulative data)? How can we mine the riches 
that are buried in information? How can we extract the useful, 
necessary,  and  essential  pieces  of  information  from  huge 
collections of data?
_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  leads  us  to  confront  three  primary  challenges:  the ﬁ rst 
was to ﬁ nd an area to represent posthumanism. The second 
was to give this area a visual form. The third was to integrate, 
in an intuitive way, the signiﬁ cant number of data and texts on 
the subject.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1. A general level of the visualized thematic map
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The system offers users a certain number of areas, based on 
the algorithms used to process the data. These areas represent 
themes. Clicking on the brain icons allows the user to read an 
excerpt from one of the texts that is part of the cluster.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Methodology
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  order  to  successfully  create  this  thematic  map,  we  ﬁ rst 
compiled a signiﬁ cant number of texts about posthumanism. 
The  methodology  used  to  treat  the  corpus  was  inspired  by 
previous work in the ﬁ eld of text mining (Forest, 2006; Ibekwe-
Sanjuan, 2007; Weiss et al., 2005). The goal of the analysis is to 
facilitate the extraction and organization of thematic groups. 
Non-supervised  clustering  technique  is  used  in  order  to 
produce a synthetic view of the thematic area of the subject 
being treated. The data is processed in four main steps:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. Segmentation of the documents, lexical extraction and ﬁ ltering
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. Text transformation using vector space model
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. Segment classiﬁ cation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. Information visualization
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Having  established  and  sorted  a  sizeable 
information-
population,  a  new  continent  was  needed.  The  continental 
outline  of  Antarctica  was  adopted.  Antarctica  was  chosen 
because  its  contours  are  relatively  unknown  and  generally 
unrecognizable; it tends to be thought of more as a white sliver 
at the bottom of the world map than a real place. Politically 
neutral Antarctica, whose shape is curiously similar to that of 
the human brain, is a large area surrounded by oceans. These 
qualities made it symbolically ideal for utilization in a map of 
posthumanism, a New World of the 21st century.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Antarctica also allowed us to avoid information overload typical 
of  a  populated  area:  it  carries  minimal  associative  memories 
and historic bias; few people have lived there. To differentiate 
our new continent, the contour of Antarctica was moved into 
the mid Paciﬁ c. The continent was then reskinned visually with 
terrain suggestive of neurology, cybernetics, and symbiosis. The 
end result was a new land mass free of memories ready for an 
abstract population.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Visualizing the results
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>After identifying the thematic structure of the corpus, themes 
are converted into regions. Themes are assigned portions of 
the  continent  proportional  to  their  occurrence.  Inside  each 
major region are 2 added levels of analysis: sub-regions and sub-
sub-regions, each represented by several keywords. Keywords 
correspond to clusters discovered during the automated text 
analysis. So it is possible to burrow physically downward into 
the subject with greater and greater accuracy; or to rest at an 
attitude  above  the  subject  and  consider  the  overall ‘terrain’. 
Each area is associated with a category of documents. From 
each area it is possible to consult the documents associated 
with each region.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure2. A speciﬁ c level of the thematic map
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>When the user zooms in on a region, the application shows 
the next level in the hierarchy of data visualization. Within one 
theme (as shown below) several sub-themes appear (in red).  
A greater number of excerpts is available for the same area.

We  think  that  giving  these  data  an  intuitive  form  will  make 
their  meaning  more  understandable  and  provide  for  their 
penetration into the collective consciousness. Posthumanism 
seems particularly well adapted to pioneer this system because 
it questions the very deﬁ nition of what it is to be human.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>      How Rhythmical is 
Hexameter: A Statistical 
Approach to Ancient Epic 
Poetry

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper, I argue that the later a given specimen of hexamater 
is,  the  less  rhythmical  it  tends  to  be. A  brief  discussion  of 
the  background  of  ancient  Greek  and  Latin  metrics  and  its 
connections  to  orality  is  followed  by  an  account  of  spectral 
density analysis as my chosen method. I then go on to comment 
on  the  experimental  data  obtained  by  representing  several 
samples of ancient poetry as coded sequences of binary values. 
In the last section, I suggest how spectral density analysis may 
help to account for other features of ancient meter.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ancient  epic  poems,  especially  the  most  archaic  Greek 
poetry  attributed  to  Homer,  are  usually  referred  as  an 
extraordinary fact in  the  history  of European literature.  For 
present-day readers educated in a culture of writing, it seems 
unbelievable  that  such  a  large  body  of  poetry  should  have 
been  composed  in  a  culture  based  on  oral  transmission.  In 
fact, despite of genuine singers’ and audience’s memory, epic 
poems did not emerge at once as ﬁ xed texts, but they were 
re-composed  in  each  performance  (Lord  2000,  Foley  1993, 
Nagy 1996). The surviving ancient epic poetry displays some 
features  that  reﬂ ect  archaic  techniques  of  oral  composition, 
formulaic  structure  being  probably  the  most  characteristic 
(Parry 1971: 37-117).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Since formulaic diction prefers some ﬁ xed rhythmical patterns 
(Parry 1971: 8-21), we can ask some questions about the role 
of both versiﬁ cation and rhythm in oral composition. Why was 
all  of  ancient  epic  poetry,  both  Greek  and  Latin,  composed 
in one particular type of meter called hexameter? Does the 
choice of meter inﬂ uence the rhythmicity of a text? Why does 
hexameter,  in  spite  of  its  relatively  restricted  possibilities  of 
shaping  rhythm,  differ  so  much  from  one  writer  to  another 
some  (cf.  Duckworth  1969:  37-87)? And,  last  but  not  least, 
what  possible  reasons  are  there  for  those  wide  differences 
between particular authors?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It  is  commonly  known  that  poetry  is  in  general  easier  to 
memorize than prose, because rhythm itself tends to facilitate 
memorization.  In  a  culture  without  writing,  memorization  is 
crucial, and much depends on the quality of oral transmission. 
In  epic  poems  from  an  oral  culture  rhythm  is  thus  likely  to 
be particularly important for both singers and hearers, even 
though  they  need  not  consciously  perceive  poetic  texts  as 
rhythmical to beneﬁ t from rhythm as an aid to memory.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>ancient  verse  was  purely  quantitative  or  whether  it  also 
had  some  prosodic  features  (Pawlowski  &  Eder  2001),  the 
quantity-based nature of Greek and Roman meter was never 
questioned. It is probable that rhythm was generated not only 
by quantity (especially in live performances), but it is certain 
that  quantity  itself  played  an  essential  role  in  ancient  meter. 
Thus, in the coding procedure, all prosodic features were left 
out  except  the  quantity  of  syllables  (cf.  Jones  &  Gray  1972, 
Duckworth 1969, Foley 1993, etc.). A binary-coded series was 
then obtained for each sample, e.g., book 22 of the Iliad begins 
as a series of values:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1110010010010011100100100100111001110010010011...
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  coded  samples  were  analyzed  by  means  of  the  spectral 
density function. As might be expected, on each spectrogram 
there appeared a few peaks indicating the existence of several 
rhythmical  waves  in  the  data.  However,  while  the  peaks 
suggesting the existence of 2- and 3-syllable patterns it the text 
were very similar for all the spectrograms and quite obvious, 
the other peaks showed some large differences between the 
samples.  Perhaps  the  most  surprising  was  the  peak  echoing 
the wave with a 16-syllable period, which could be found in the 
samples of early Greek poems by Homer, Hesiod, Apollonius, 
and Aratos (cf. Fig. 1). The same peak was far less noticeable in 
the late Greek hexameter of Nonnos, and almost absent in the 
samples of Latin writers (cf. Fig. 2). Other differences between 
the  spectrograms  have  corroborated  the  observation:  the 
rhythmical effects of the late poems were, in general, weaker 
as compared with the rich rhythmical structure of the earliest, 
orally composed epic poems.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Although the main hypothesis has been veriﬁ ed, the results also 
showed some peculiarities. For example, the archaic poems by 
Homer and Hesiod did not differ signiﬁ cantly from the poems 
of the Alexandrian age (Apollonius, Aratos), which was rather 
unexpected. Again, the rhythm of the Latin hexameter turned 
out to have a different underlying structure than that of all the 
Greek samples. There are some possible explanations of those 
facts,  such  as  that  the  weaker  rhythm  of  the  Latin  samples 
may relate to inherent differences between Latin and Greek. 
More  research,  both  in  statistics  and  in  philology,  is  needed, 
however, to make such explanations more nuanced and more 
persuasive.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It may then be expected on theoretical grounds that non-oral 
poems, such as the Latin epic poetry or the Greek hexameter 
of  the Alexandrian  age,  will  be  largely  non-rhythmical,  or  at 
least  display  weaker  rhythm  effects  than  the  archaic  poems 
of Homer and Hesiod. Although formulaic diction and other 
techniques  of  oral  composition  are  noticeable  mostly  in 
Homer’s epics (Parry 1971, Lord 2000, Foley 1993, etc.), the 
later  hexameters,  both  Greek  and  Latin,  also  display  some 
features  of  oral  diction  (Parry  1971:  24-36).  The  metrical 
structure  of  hexameter  might  be  quite  similar:  strongly 
rhythmical  in  the  oldest  (or  rather,  the  most  archaic)  epic 
poems, and less conspicuous in poems composed in written 
form  a  few  centuries  after  Homer. The  aim  of  the  present 
study is to test the hypothesis that the later a given specimen 
of hexameter is, the less rhythmical it tends to be.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Because of its nature versiﬁ cation easily lends itself to statistical 
analysis. A  great  deal  of  work  has  already  been  done  in  this 
ﬁ eld,  including  studies  of  Greek  and  Latin  hexameter  (Jones 
&  Gray  1972,  Duckworth  1969,  Foley  1993,  etc.).  However, 
the  main  disadvantage  of  the  methods  applied  in  existing 
research is that they describe a given meter as if it were a set 
of  independent  elements,  which  is  actually  not  true.  In  each 
versiﬁ cation  system,  the  speciﬁ c  sequence  of  elements  plays 
a far more important role in establishing a particular type of 
rhythm than the relations between those elements regardless 
their linear order (language “in the mass” vs. language “in the 
line”; cf. Pawlowski 1999).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fortunately,  there  are  a  few  methods  of  statistical  analysis 
(both  numeric  and  probabilistic)  that  study  verse  by  means 
of an ordered sequence of elements. These methods include, 
for example, time series modeling, Fourier analysis, the theory 
of Markov chains and Shannon’s theory of information. In the 
present  study,  spectral  density  analysis  was  used  (Gottman 
1999, Priestley 1981, etc.). Spectral analysis seems to be a very 
suitable  tool  because  it  provides  a  cross-section  of  a  given 
time series: it allows us to detect waves, regularities and cycles 
which are not otherwise manifest and open to inspection. In 
the  case  of  a  coded  poetry  sample,  the  spectrogram  shows 
not  only  simple  repetitions  of  metrical  patterns,  but  also 
some subtle rhythmical relations, if any, between distant lines 
or  stanzas.  On  a  given  spectrogram,  a  distinguishable  peak 
indicates the existence of a rhythmical wave; numerous peaks 
suggest  a  quite  complicated  rhythm,  while  a  pure  noise  (no 
peaks) on the spectrogram reﬂ ects a non-rhythmical data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To verify the hypothesis of hexameter’s decreasing rhythmicity, 
7 samples of Greek and 3 samples of Latin epic poetry were 
chosen.  The  speciﬁ c  selection  of  sample  material  was  as 
follows:  3  samples  from  Homeric  hexameter  (books  18  and 
22 from the Iliad, book 3 from the Odyssey), 1 sample from 
Hesiod (Theogony), Apollonius (Argonautica, book 1), Aratos 
(Phainomena),  Nonnos  (Dionysiaca,  book  1), Vergil  (Aeneid, 
book  3),  Horace  (Ars  poetica),  and  Ovid  (Metamorphoses, 
book  1).  In  each  sample,  the  ﬁ rst  500  lines  were  coded  in 
such a way that each long syllable was assigned value 1, and 
each  short  syllable  value  0. Though  it  is  disputed  whether

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>and  IFLA’s  FRBR  (FRBR  1998)  is  in  the  process  of  being 
completed. The  EAD  has  already  been  mapped  to  CIDOC 
CRM (Theodoridou 2001).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>CIDOC  CRM  is  deﬁ ned  in  an  object  oriented  formalism 
which  allow  for  a  compact  deﬁ nition  with  abstraction  and 
generalisation. The model is event centric, that is, actors, places 
and objects are connected via events. CIDOC CRM is a core 
ontology in the sense that the model does not have classes 
for  all  particulars  like  for  example  the Art  and Architecture 
Thesaurus with thousands of concepts. CIDOC CRM has little 
more  than  80  classes  and  130  properties. The  most  central 
classes and properties for data interchange are shown below.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Since the mid 1990s there has been an increase in the interest 
for  the  design  and  use  of  conceptual  models  (ontologies) 
in  humanities  computing  and  library  science,  as  well  as  in 
knowledge engineering in general. There is also a wish to use 
such models to enable information interchange. TEI has in its 
20 years of history concentrated on the mark up of functional 
aspects  of  texts  and  their  parts. That  is,  a  person  name  is 
marked but linking to information about the real world person 
denoted by that name was not in the main scope. The scope 
of TEI has gradually broadened, however, to include more real 
world information external to the text in question. The Master 
project (Master 2001) is an early example of this change.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In TEI P5 a series of new elements for marking up real world 
information  are  introduced  and  several  such  elements  from 
the P4 are adjusted. TEI P5 is meant to be a set of guidelines 
for the encoding of a large variety of texts in many cultural 
contexts. Thus the set of real world oriented elements in TEI 
P5  should  not  formally  be  bound  to  a  single  ontology. The 
ontological part of TEI P5 is, however, close connected to the 
authors  implicit  world  view. Thus  we  believe  it  is  important 
to study this part of TEI P5 with some well deﬁ ned ontology 
as a yardstick. Our long experience with memory institution 
sector makes CIDOC CRM (Conceptual Reference Model) a 
natural choice. CIDOC CRM (Crofts 2005) has been proven 
useful as an intellectual aid in the formulation of the intended 
scope  of  the  elements  in  a  new  mark  up  schemes    and  we 
believe  the  model  can  be  useful  to  clarify  the  ontological 
part  of TEI. This  will  also  clarify  what  is  needed  in  order  to 
harmonize it with major standards like CIDOC CRM, FRBR, 
EAD and CDWA Lite.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>CIDOC CRM
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>information. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>CIDOC CRM is a formal ontology intended to facilitate the 
integration,  mediation  and  interchange  of  heterogeneous 
cultural  heritage 
It  was  developed  by 
interdisciplinary  teams  of  experts,  coming  from  ﬁ elds  such 
as  computer  science,  archaeology,  museum  documentation, 
history  of  arts,  natural  history,  library  science,  physics  and 
philosophy,  under  the  aegis  of  the  International  Committee 
for  Documentation  (CIDOC)  of  the  International  Council 
of  Museums  (ICOM).  The  harmonisation  of  CIDOC  CRM 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Example: The issue of a medieval charter can be modelled as 
an  activity  connecting  the  issuer,  witnesses,  scribe  and  place 
and time of issue. The content of the charter is modelled as 
a conceptual object and the parchment as a physical thing. In 
cases where it is necessary for a scholarly analysis and when 
sufﬁ cient  information  has  been  preserved,  an  issuing  of  a 
charter can be broken down into a series of smaller events, e.g., 
the actual declaration in a court, the writing of the parchment 
and the attachment of the seals. This conceptual analysis can 
be  can  be  used  an  intellectual  aid  in  the  formulation  a  data 
model and implementation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  2005  the  CRM  was  reformulated  as  a  simple  XML  DTD, 
called  CRM-Core,  to  enable  CRM  compliant  mark  up  of 
multimedia  metadata  (Sinclair  2006).  A  CRM-Core  XML 
package  may  contain  information  about  a  single  instance 
of  any  class  in  the  CRM  and  how  it  may  be  connected  to 
other objects via events and properties. The German Council 
of  Museum  has  based  its  standard  for  XML  based  museum 
data  interchange,  MUSEUMDAT,  on  a  combination  of  the 
Getty standard CDWA Lite and CRM Core.  The CDWA Lite 
revision group currently considers these changes to CDWA 
Lite in order to make it compatible with CRM.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>TEI P5 ontology elements in the light 
of CIDOC CRM
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In TEI P5 the new ontologically oriented elements is introduced 
in the module NamesPlaces described in chapter 13 Names, 
Dates,  People,  and  Places.  There  are  additional  elements 
described  in  chapter  10  Manuscript  Description,  in  the  TEI 
header  and  in  connection  with  bibliographic  descriptions  as 
well. In this paper we concentrate on the elements in chapter 
13.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The central elements in this module are: person, personGrp, org, 
place and event. Person, personGrp and org are “elements which 
provide  information  about  people  and  their  relationships”. 
CIDOC CRM has the corresponding classes with a common 
superclass E29 Actor.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The element event is deﬁ ned as “contains data relating to any 
kind  of  signiﬁ cant  event  associated  with  a  person,  place,  or 
organization” and is similar to the CIDOC CRM class E5 Event 
and its subclasses. In the discussion of the marriage example 
in chapter 13, event element is presented as a “freestanding” 
element.  In  the  formal  deﬁ nition  it  is  limited  to  person  and 
org. To  make  this  coherent,  the  formal  part  will  have  to  be 
extended or the example have to be changed.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Still event is problematic. The marriage example demonstrates 
that  it  is  impossible  to  express  the  role  a  person  has  in  an 
event. Without  knowing  the  English  marriage  formalism  one 
doesn’t know if the “best man” participated. The very generic 
element persRel introduced in P5 does not solve this problem. 
A  possible  solution  to  this  problem  would  be  to  introduce 
an  EventStateLike  model  class  with  elements  for  roles  and 
participants.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  model  classes  orgStateLike,  personStateLike,  personTraitLik, 
placeStateLike,  placeTraitLike  group  elements  used  to  mark 
up  characteristics  of  persons,  organisations  and  places. The 
elements in ...TraitLike model classes contain information about 
permanent  characteristics  and  the  elements  in    ...StateLike 
information about more temporal characteristics. The model 
classes contain the generic Trait and State elements in addition to 
specialised elements. The intention is to link all characteristics 
relating to a person, organisation or place. It is not possible to 
make a single mapping from these classes into CIDOC-CRM. 
It will depend partly on which type of trait or strait is used, 
and partly on the way in which it is used. Many characteristics 
will  correspond  to  persistent  items  like  E55 Types,  E3  String 
and  E41 Appellation,  and  are  connected  to  actors  and  places 
through the properties P1 is identiﬁ ed, P2 has type and P2 has 
note. Other elements like ﬂ oruit, which is used to describe a 
person’s active period, are temporal states corresponding to 
the CIDOC-CRM temporal entity E3 Condition State. From an 
ontological point of view the two elements state and trait can 
be considered as generic mechanism for typed linking between 
the major classes.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>All  the  elements  in    ...TraitLike  and  ...StateLike  model  classes 
can  be  supplied  with  the  attributes  notAfter  and  notBefore 
deﬁ ning the temporal extension of their validity. This is a very 
powerful  mechanism  for  expressing  synoptically  information 
based  on  hidden  extensive  scholarly  investigation  about  real 
world  events. As  long  as  the  justiﬁ cation  for  the  values  in 
these elements is not present, however, it is hard to map this 
information into an event oriented conceptual model like the 
CRM. Thus, it is important to include descriptions of methods 
for such justiﬁ cation in the guidelines, including examples.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>TEI ontology – conclusion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  new  elements  in TEI  P5  bring TEI  a  great  step  in  the 
direction  of  an  event  oriented  model.  Our  use  of  CRM 
Core as a yardstick has shown that small extensions to and 
adjustments of the P5 elements will enable the expression of 
CRM Core packages by TEI elements. This is a major change to 
our previous suggestions (Ore 2006) in which the ontological 
module was outside TEI. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To continue this research, an extended TEI tagset should be 
developed  with  element  for  abstracts  corresponding  to  the 
ones in FRBR and CRM. This will not change the ontological 
structure of TEI signiﬁ cantly. But these adjustments will make 
the ontological information in a TEI document compliant with 
the  other  cultural  heritage  models  like  for  example  EAD, 
FRBR/FRBRoo,  CIDOC  CRM  and  CDWA-Lite. There  is  an 
ongoing harmonisation process between all these initiatives in 
which it is important that TEI is a part.

reasonable one that is widely accepted in authorship attribution. 
Some  important  studies  concentrate  on  individual  authors, 
using  a  wide  array  of  methods,  and  yielding  varied  results, 
however, so that is unwise to generalize (see the overview in 
Stamou 2007). Henry James’s style, for example, changes in a 
remarkably consistent and extreme way (Hoover 2007), and 
Austen’s stylistic development also seems consistent (Burrows 
1987), but Beckett’s texts are individually innovative without 
showing consistent trends (Stamou 2007: 3). For some authors, 
different investigators have obtained inconsistent results. We 
know of no general study that investigates how authorial style 
changes over a long career. We thus explore how working and 
otherwise living abroad for periods exceeding two years may 
affect an author’s vocabulary and style.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our presentation begins a broadly based study of the growth 
and decay of authorial vocabulary over time. Although we limit 
our study to nineteenth-century prose, to reduce the number 
of possible variables to a manageable level, we compare French 
and English authors, allowing us to test whether any discovered 
regularities are cross-linguistic. Because authors’ vocabularies 
seem  related  to  their  life  experiences,  we  compare  authors 
who  spent  most  of  their  lives  in  a  single  geographical  area 
with others who traveled and lived extensively abroad. For the 
purposes of this study, we deﬁ ne extensive living and working 
abroad as at least two consecutive years, somewhat longer than 
the  contemporary  American  student’s  or  faculty  member’s 
stay of a semester or a year. This differentiation allows us to 
investigate  in  what  signiﬁ cant  ways,  if  any,  extensive  foreign 
travel affects an author’s vocabulary.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our investigation of these questions requires a careful selection 
of  authors  and  texts. Although  research  is  still  ongoing,  we 
have selected the following eight authors–two in each of the 
four  possible  categories–for  preliminary  testing  and  further 
biographical study:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>from 1831-1849, he was a protégé of Alexis de Tocqueville, 
who brought him into the French diplomatic service in 
1849. Gobineau was then stationed in Switzerland and 
Germany (1849-1854), Persia (1855-1858, 1861-1863), 
Newfoundland (1859), Greece (1864-1868), Brazil (1868-
1870) and Sweden (1872-1873). Following travel through 
Europe in 1875-77, he left the diplomatic service. His ﬁ rst 
short ﬁ ction was published and serialized in 1846. At least 
a dozen novellas written throughout his career (mostly 
written and published as collections) and two novels (1852 
and 1874) are available in digitized format.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Victor Hugo (1802-85). Raised in France except for a 
six-month period in a religious boarding school in Madrid 
(1811-12), Hugo began writing his ﬁ rst novel, Bug-Jargal 
(1826) in 1820. This initial literary period includes 1820-
1851. Aside from a few short trips lasting less than three 
months, Hugo lived and wrote mainly in his homeland 
until his exile on the Island of Guernsey during the reign 
of Louis-Napoléon from 1851-1870. The third period 
encompasses his triumphant return to Paris in 1871 until his 
death, celebrated by a state funeral, in 1885.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Research on the French authors is being facilitated by use of 
PhiloLogic  and  the ARTFL  database,  complemented  by  local 
digitized works and tools that are also used to investigate the 
English authors. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Preliminary testing must be done on all the authors to discover 
overall  trends  or  principles  of  vocabulary  development 
before investigating any possible effects of foreign travel. The 
importance of this can be seen in ﬁ gures 1 and 2 below, two 
cluster analyses of English traveling authors, based on the 800 
mfw (most frequent words). Dickens’s novels form two distinct 
groups,  1836-43  and  1848-70,  a  division  coinciding  with  his 
1844-47 travels. For Trollope, the match is not quite so neat, 
but it is suggestive. Ignoring Nina Balatka, a short romance set 
in Prague, and La Vendee, Trollope’s only historical novel, set in 
France in the 1790’s, only two remaining novels in the early 
group were published after his travel to Egypt, Scotland, and 
the West Indies in 1858-59. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Domestic authors:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>English
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• George Meredith (1828-1909). German schooling at age 
ﬁ fteen, but apparently no signiﬁ cant travel later; ﬁ fteen 
novels published between 1855 and 1895 available in digital 
form.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Wilkie Collins (1824-1889). No foreign travel mentioned in 
brief biographies; 20 novels available over 38 years.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>French 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850). He traveled little outside 
of France until 1843. Subsequent excursions abroad in 
the last seven years of his life, mainly for romance, were 
relatively infrequent and never exceeded ﬁ ve consecutive 
months. Over two dozen novels in digitized format are 
available.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly (1808-1889). Raised in France and 
schooled in the law, he was devoted to his native Normandy 
and seldom ventured abroad. Initially cultivating the image of 
the dandy, his novels and novellas create a curious paradox 
in his later writing between sexually suggestive themes and 
nostalgia for earlier aesthetics and a defense of Catholicism. 
His literary productivity can be divided into the three 
periods of 1831-1844 (ﬁ rst published novel and novella), 
1845-1873 (return to Catholicism; work as both literary 
critic and novelist), and 1874-1889. At least fourteen novels 
or novellas are available in digitized format.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Traveling authors:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>English
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Dickens (1812-1870). Seven novels available 1836-43, 
foreign travel for 3 yrs 1844-47, and more travel in 1853-55; 
four novels after 1855 available.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Trollope (1815-1883). Travel to Brussels in 1834, but 
brieﬂ y; six novels available before 1859, Postal missions to 
Egypt, Scotland, and the West Indies, 1858-59; 1871 trip 
to Australia, New Zealand, and US; travel to Ceylon and 
Australia, 1875, South Africa 1877, Iceland 1878; ﬁ ve novels 
available after 1878.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>French
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Arthur de Gobineau (1816-1882). Raised partly in France, 
partly in Germany and Switzerland, he learned German 
and began the study of Persian in school while his mother, 
accused of fraud and estranged from her military husband, 
kept the family a step ahead of the French police. Three 
periods encompassing his publication of ﬁ ction and often 
related to career travel can be divided as follows: 1843-
1852 (at least 4 novellas and 1 novel); 1853-1863 (1 novella); 
1864-1879 (10 novellas, 2 novels). Living mainly in France

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Unfortunately,  comparing  cluster  analyses  of  the  English 
domestic  authors  casts  doubt  on  any  simple  correlation 
between  travel  and  major  stylistic  change.  Meredith,  like 
Dickens and Trollope, shows a sharp break between his two 
early novels 1855-57 and the rest of his novels (see Fig. 3). And, 
ignoring Antonina (an historical novel about the fall of Rome), 
Collins’s novels also form early and late groups (see Fig. 4).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fig. 3 – Fifteen Meredith Novels, 1855-895
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  are  still  developing  the  techniques  for  the  study  of  the 
effects of travel, but preliminary testing based on a division of 
each author’s career into early, middle, and late periods allows 
us to check for consistent trends rather than simple differences 
between early and late texts, and to begin comparing the four 
categories  of  authors.  Choosing  novelists  with  long  careers 
allows us to separate the three periods, selecting natural gaps 
in  publication  where  possible,  but  creating  such  gaps  where 
necessary by omitting some texts from the study. For traveling 
authors,  these  divisions  also  take  into  account  the  timing  of 
their travel, creating gaps that include the travel.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Three stylistic periods create six patterns of highest, middle, 
and lowest frequency for each word in the an author’s texts. 
Depending on the number and size of the novels, we include 
approximately  the  8,000  to  10,000  most  frequent  words,  all 
those frequent enough to show a clear increase or decrease 
in frequency; we delete words that appear in only one period. 
Thus,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6,  each  of  the  six  patterns  would  be 
expected  to  occur  about  one-sixth  (17%)  of  the  time  by 
chance.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fig. 6 –Six Patterns of Change (“E” = 
early; “M” = middle; “L” = late)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Results  for  the  English  authors,  shown  in  Fig.  7,  are  both 
surprising  and  suggestive  (note  that  the  axis  crosses  at  the 
“expected” 16.7% level, so that it is easy to see which patterns 
are  more  or  less  frequent  than  expected  for  each  author. 
Gradual decrease in frequency, E > M > L, is the only pattern 
more frequent than expected for all four authors (Meredith’s 
ﬁ gure is only very slightly more frequent than expected), and 
both M > E > L and L > E > M are less frequent than expected 
for all four authors. Although the patterns for these authors 
suggest some regularity in the growth and decay of vocabulary, 
no simple relationship emerges. Consider also the surprising 
fact that vocabulary richness tends to decrease chronologically 
for Dickens, Trollope, and possibly Collins, while only Meredith 
shows  increasing  vocabulary  richness.  (These  comments  are 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fig. 4 – Twenty Collins Novels, 1850-1888
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Furthermore,  although  our  results  for  French  authors  are 
more preliminary, a test of six works by Gobineau shows that 
two of his earliest texts, written before any extensive travel, 
are quite similar to some of his latest texts (see Fig. 5).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>based on a relatively simple measure of vocabulary richness, 
the  number  of  different  words  per  10,000  running  words; 
for more discussion of vocabulary richness, see Tweedie and 
Baayen,  1998  and  Hoover,  2003.) These  facts  contradict  the 
intuitive  assumption  that  the  main  trend  in  a  writer’s  total 
vocabulary should be the learning of new words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Similar  comparisons  are  being  developed  for  the  French 
authors in question. The conference presentation will include 
not  only  a  comparison  of  style  within  each  language  group, 
but  between  language  groups.  Such  comparisons  also  build 
on  strengths  of  corpus  stylistics  important  to  translation 
(Goldﬁ eld 2006) and a possible related future for comparative 
literature (Apter 2005).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  paper  we  are  presenting  the  Heinrich  Heine  Portal, 
one  of  the  most  sophisticated  web  resources  dedicated 
to  a  German  classical  author.  It  virtually  combines  the  two 
most  deﬁ nitive  critical  editions  (DHA=Düsseldorfer  Heine-
Ausgabe  and  HSA=Heine  Säkularausgabe)  in  print  together 
with  digital  images  of  the  underlying  textual  originals  within 
an elaborated electronic platform. The project, which has been 
established  in  2002,  is  organized  as  a  co-operation  between 
the Heinrich-Heine-Institut (Düsseldorf) and the Competence 
Centre for Electronic Publishing and Information Retrieval in 
the Humanities (University of Trier). It has been funded by the 
Deutsche  Forschungsgemeinschaft  (DFG,  German  Research 
Organisation) as well as the Kunststiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen 
(Foundation  for  the  Arts  of  North  Rhine Westphalia). The 
work within the project consists of two major parts. On the 
one  hand  it  has  to  transfer  the  printed  texts  into  a  digital 
representation  which  serves  as  the  basis  for  its  electronic 
publication. On the other hand it aims at a complete revision 
of important parts of the printed critical edition and provides 
new results of the Heinrich-Heine research community.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ﬁ rst  part  of  the  workﬂ ow  is  organized  as  a  typical 
retro-digitization  project.  Starting  with  the  printed  editions, 
consisting of nearly 26,500 pages with an amount of about 72 
millions of characters, the text was sent to a service partner 
in China, where it was typed in by hand. During this process 
two digital versions of the text were produced and then sent 
back  to  Germany,  where  they  were  automatically  collated. 
After  that  the  listed  differences  were  manually  corrected 
by  comparing  them  with  the  printed  original. The  result  of 
this  step  is  a  digital  text  that  corresponds  with  the  printed 
version  providing  a  quality  of  nearly  99.995%. The  next  task 
was  to  transform  this  basic  digital  encoding  into  a  platform 
independent  representation,  which  then  can  be  used  as  the 
main data format for all following project phases. In order to 
achieve this goal a pool of program routines was developed 
which  uses  the  typographical  information  and  contextual 
conditions  to  generate  XML-markup  according  to  the  TEI 
guidelines.  Because  of  the  heterogeneous  structures  of 
the  text  (prose,  lyrics,  critical  apparatus,  tables  of  contents 
etc.)  this  was  a  very  time  consuming  step.  At  the  end  of 
this  process  a  reusable  version  of  the  data  that  can  be  put 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>into the archives on a long time basis exists. Using the XML 
encoding the digital documents were imported into an online 
database,  where  different  views  onto  the  data  are  stored 
separately,  e.g.  metadata  for  the  main  information  about  the 
letter  corpus  (list  of  senders,  addressees,  dates  and  places 
etc.) or bibliographical information on the works. In order to 
get access to the information from the database the project 
has been supplied with a sophisticated graphical user interface, 
which has been built with the help of a content management 
framework (ZOPE).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Besides providing online access to the basic editions DHA and 
HSA  the  Heinrich-Heine-Portal  offers  a  completely  revised 
and updated version of the letter corpus and displays newly-
discovered  letters  and  corrigenda,  which  are  being  added 
constantly.  Additionally,  the  portal  is  an  electronic  archive 
which contains and presents more than 12,000 digital images 
of original manuscripts and ﬁ rst editions, linked to the text and 
the apparatus of the edition. Most of those images were made 
available  by  the  Heinrich-Heine-Institut,  Düsseldorf,  which 
holds  nearly  60%  of  the  Heine-manuscripts  known  today. 
The collection of the Heine-Institut was completely digitized 
for  this  project.  In  addition,  32  other  museums,  libraries 
and  literary  archives  in  Europe  and  the  United  States  are 
cooperating with the Heine-Portal and have given us consent 
to present manuscripts from their collections. Among them are 
the British Library and the Rothschild Archive in London, the 
Russian Archives of Social and Political History in Moscow, the 
Foundation of Weimar Classics and many others. One of the 
long-term goals of the Heine-Portal is a “virtual uniﬁ cation” of 
all of Heine’s manuscripts. Beyond that the Heine-Portal offers 
extensive  bibliographies  of  primary  sources  and  secondary 
literature, from Heine’s own ﬁ rst publications in a small journal 
(1817)  up  to  the  most  recent  secondary  literature.  Other 
research  tools  of  the  Heine-Portal  are  a  powerful  search 
engine  and  a  complex  hyperlink  structure  which  connects 
the  texts,  commentaries  and  the  different  sections  of  the 
Portal with each other and a database of Heine’s letters with 
detailed information on their edition, their availability and the 
institutions which hold them.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our paper will describe the technical and philological aspects 
of the work process that was necessary for the completion of 
the Heine-Portal, it will give an account of its main functions 
and demonstrate their use for students and scholars alike, and 
it will discuss possible pedagogical applications for schools as 
well as university teaching.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The New Middle High 
German Dictionary and 
its Predecessors as an 
Interlinked Compound of 
Lexicographical Resources 
 Kurt Gärtner

  Universität Trier  , Germany
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  paper  gives,  ﬁ rstly,  a  brief  overview  over  the  history  of 
Middle High German (MHG) lexicography leading to the new 
MHG dictionary. Secondly, it describes the digitisation of the 
old  MHG  dictionaries  which  form  a  subnet  in  a  wider  net 
of  German  dictionaries. Thirdly,  this  network,  together  with 
speciﬁ c tools and digital texts, is seen as an essential source 
for compiling the new MHG dictionary, of which, fourthly, the 
essential features, esp. its online version, are mentioned brieﬂ y, 
but will be demonstrated in detail in the full paper.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1.  Looking  back  at  the  beginnings  of  Humanities  Computing 
in the sixties, one of the major subjects was the support the 
computer would give to lexicographers. Many e-texts have been 
created then for mere lexicographical purposes (Wisbey 1988). 
The production of concordances and indices was at its heights 
between 1970 and 1980 (cf. Gärtner 1980). However, the road 
to  real  dictionary  making  came  only  gradually  in  sight  when 
lemmatization was required and semantics began to dominate 
the  discussion  of  computer  application  in  lexicography.   The 
work on the dictionaries to the medieval Germanic languages 
beneﬁ ted  a  great  deal  from  this  development.  This  has 
certainly been the case regarding MHG, the period of German 
from ca. 1050 to ca. 1350 resp. – in the earlier periodisations 
–  to  1500.    During  the  20th  century,  the  situation  of  MHG 
lexicography  had  become  more  and  more  deplorable.  Since 
Lexer’s  dictionary  appeared  in  1878,  all  plans  for  a  new 
dictionary  had  been  unsuccessful.  Therefore,  many  editors 
of  MHG  texts  published  after  1878  provided  glossaries  as  a 
means of presenting such material that was not included in the 
earlier dictionaries edited by Benecke/Müller/Zarncke (BMZ) 
and Lexer with its Nachträge. It was not until 1985 that a group 
of researchers at the University of Trier started compiling the 
Findebuch which was published in 1992. The Findebuch was a 
compilation of glossaries to editions in order to make up for 
the lack of a new MHG dictionary. Also in the late eighties, on 
the basis of the work on the Findebuch, planning began to work 
out  a  new  MHG  dictionary  (cf.  Gärtner/Grubmüller  2000). 
This  time  the  plans  were  successful,  and  work  on  the  new 
dictionary started in 1994. The scientiﬁ c use of the computer 
had meanwhile become a conditio sine qua non, also for the new 
MHG dictionary (cf. Gärtner/Plate/Recker 1999). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>extensive use of the computer and existed in machine readable 
form,  the  need  for  digitizing  the  old  MHG  dictionaries  was 
strongly  felt  from  the  beginning  of  the  new  dictionary’s 
planning. The  old  dictionaries  (BMZ,  Lexer  with  Nachträge) 
and  the  Findebuch  are  closely  interconnected  and  can  only 
be  used  simultaneously. They  were  ideal  candidates  for  the 
composition of an electronic dictionary compound. Therefore, 
as  a  supporting  research  project  to  the  new  dictionary,  the 
old ones were digitized and interlinked thus forming a digital 
network (MWV). The work on this project has been described 
to the LLC readers in detail (Fournier 2001; see also Burch/
Fournier  2001).  Moreover,  this  network  formed  the  starting 
point for a wider net that interlinks many more dictionaries 
to the German language and its dialects (cf. Woerterbuchnetz). 
The  most  prominent  among  them  is  the  33vols.  Deutsches 
Wörterbuch (DWB) by the brothers Grimm. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3.  The  work  on  the  new  MHG  dictionary  (MWB)  was 
considerably  supported  by  two  more  projects.  First  and 
most essential for lexicographers working in different places 
was  the  implementation  of  a  web  based  workbench  for  the 
composition of dictionaries. The development of a toolkit for a 
collaborative editing and publishing of the MWB has also been 
described to LLC readers in detail (Queens/Recker 2005). The 
second  project  supporting  the  work  on  the  new  dictionary 
was the extension of the digital text archive. At the beginning 
of  the  work  on  the  MWB,  the  lexicographical  workbench 
had  to  rely  only  on  a  small  corpus  of  digital  texts.  This 
number  was  effectively  increased  by  a  collaborative  project 
with the Electronic Text Center of the University of Virginia at 
Charlottesville (cf. Recker 2002 and MHDTA/MHGTA 2004). 
By now nearly all the texts of the Findebuch corpus have been 
digitized and added to the corpus of the new dictionary. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. In 2006 the ﬁ rst instalment of the new MWB was published 
together  with  a  CD-ROM  containing  a  PDF  of  the  printed 
form. The online version was to follow in 2007. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>All  digital  resources  created  for  the  new  dictionary  are 
ﬁ rstly  to  the  advantage  of  the  lexicographer,  and  secondly 
and  still  more  important  to  the  advantage  of  the  user  as 
well. The lexicographer’s workbench provides an alphabetical 
list  of  headwords  (Lemmaliste),  it  offers  an  easy  and  quick 
access  to  the  old  dictionaries  (BMZ,  Lexer,  Findebuch),  to 
the lemmatized archive of instances (Belegearchiv) in form of 
a KWIC-concordance, and ﬁ nally to the whole corpus of e-
texts  which  can  be  searched  for  more  evidences.  Not  only 
the lexicographer, but also the user of the online version has 
access to all information on the usage of a MHG word, as I will 
demonstrate in detail. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As the new MWB is a long term project, the online version 
not only offers the already published instalments, but also the 
complete material the forthcoming fascicles are based upon. 
Furthermore,  for  the  entries  still  to  be  worked  out  the  old 
dictionaries  are  always  present  for  consultation  together 
with  the  new  material  of  the  archive  and  the  corpus  of  e-

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>    Domestic Strife in Early 
Modern Europe: Images and 
Texts in a virtual anthology
 Martin Holmes

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Claire Carlin 
ccarlin@uvic.ca
 University of Victoria, Canada  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  seventeenth-century  engravings  and  texts  collected  for 
the project Le mariage sous l’Ancien Régime: une anthologie 
virtuelle all belong to the polemical genre. The institution of 
marriage  was  undergoing  intense  scrutiny  and  criticism  in 
light  of  Reformation  questioning  of  Catholic  practices,  and 
popular  discourse  and  images  reﬂ ected  this  malaise.  The 
cuckold  attacked  both  verbally  and  physically  by  a  nagging 
wife,  or,  conversely,  a  sassy  wife  receiving  her “correction” 
are themes of the Middle Ages reproduced frequently during 
the  early  modern  period,  but  with  new  sophistication  as 
engravings  became  the  primary  site  for  the  representation 
of  problems  with  marriage,  as  DeJean  has  shown. Whereas 
polemical  writings  ﬂ ourished  in  the  ﬁ rst  half  of  the  century 
according to Banderier and Carlin 2002, images gained more 
complexity in design and incorporated increasing amounts of 
commentary during the reign of Louis XIV (1661-1715). New 
variations  on  medieval  topics  occur,  as  bourgeois  women  in 
salons comment on marriage or wrestle with their husbands 
over the pants in the family. A novel twist on spousal conﬂ ict 
appears  in  engravings  such  as  “L’invention  des  femmes” 
(Lagniet) and “Operateur céphalique” (Anon.): inspired by the 
Renaissance interest in dissection, the notion that behaviour 
could be modiﬁ ed through radical brain surgery introduces a 
new kind of violence into marriage satire.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>From the beginning of the project, our approach to construction 
of the corpus has been based on the ideal that texts and images 
must both be full and equivalent members of the collection. 
Images have been treated as texts, and our goal has been to 
make explicit, in textual annotations, as much of the signiﬁ cant 
information  they  encode  as  possible.  In  this  respect,  the 
Mariage project is very different from other markup projects 
which integrate images and texts, such as those described in 
Porter 2007; while projects such as Pembroke 25 (Szarmach 
&  Hall  n.d.)  and  the  Electronic Aelfric  integrate  images  and 
text in sophisticated ways, the images are of manuscript pages, 
and the at the heart of these digital editions is the process of 
transcription. By contrast, while the engravings in the Mariage 
collection  may  include  fairly  extensive  textual  components 
— see, for instance, “Le Fardeau du Menage” (Guérard 1712), 
which  incorporates  over  60  lines  of  verse  —  the  text  is 
ancillary  to  the  scenes  depicted. Thus,  the  engravings  in  the 
Mariage project are somewhere on a continuum between the 
page-images of a digital edition of a manuscript, and the images 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>of artworks in a project such as the On-Line Picasso Project 
(Mallen n.d.).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At the simplest level, marking up the images means transcribing 
and clarifying any text which actually appears on the engravings. 
This makes the text on the images as searchable as that of the 
poetry and prose. Following this, we have begun to identify and 
discuss the signiﬁ cance of individual ﬁ gures in the engravings, 
as  well  as  linking  these  ﬁ gures  to  similar  elements  in  other 
engravings, or to texts in the collection. Figure 1 shows this 
kind of linking in as it appears to the reader in a Web browser. 
The wife’s lover is a recurrent ﬁ gure in images and texts of the 
period, and the annotation links to textual references, and also 
to a segment of another image.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 2: Results of a search, showing sections of images 
as well as a poem retrieved from the database.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We are now marking up symbols and devices, and have begun 
to contemplate the possibility that we might mark up virtually 
every  object  which  appears  in  the  engravings. Although  this 
would  be  rather  laborious,  it  would  enable  the  discovery  of 
more correspondences and perhaps more symbolism than is 
currently apparent. To be able to search for “poule”, and retrieve 
all the depictions of hens which appear in the collection (as well 
as instances of the word itself), and view them together on the 
same page, would provide a powerful tool for researchers. This 
level of annotation (the identiﬁ cation and labelling of everyday 
objects) does not require any signiﬁ cant expertise, but it will 
contribute a great deal to the value of the collection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Using the combination of textual and image markup, our team 
has been able to uncover links across the decades as well as 
slowly developing differences among diverse types of polemical 
images. Research questions we have begun to explore include 
the following:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- How does the use of key vocabulary evolve over the 
sixteenth to eighteenth centuries?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- How does the use of objects, especially the instruments of 
violence, change over this period?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- How does the use of stock verses and verse forms 
develop over the course of this period?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  addition  to  discussing  the  research  tools  and  insights 
emerging  out  of  the  Mariage  project,  this  presentation  will 
look at the development of the Image Markup Tool, an open-
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1: Linking between image areas and other texts.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In addition, the search system on the site has been designed to 
retrieve both blocks of text and segments of images, based on 
annotations to the images. Figure 2 shows part of the result 
set from a search for “frapp*”, including sections of images and 
a line from a poem. In the case of an image hit, clicking on the 
link will lead to the annotated image with the “hit annotation” 
selected.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>source Windows  application  which  was  created  initially  for 
use in the Mariage project, but which is now used in a range 
of other projects as well. The IMT has acquired a number of 
new features in response to the requirements of the Mariage 
project, and is also developing in reaction to changes in TEI P5. 
The original approach of the IMT was to blend SVG with TEI 
to produce a dual-namespace document (Carlin, Haswell and 
Holmes 2006), but the incorporation of the new <facsimile>, 
<surface> and <zone> elements in the TEI transcr module (TEI 
Consortium 2007, 11.1) now provide a native TEI framework 
which  appears  suited  to  image  markup  projects  such  as 
Mariage, and in December 2007, a new version of the Image 
Markup Tool  was  released,  which  relinquishes  the  SVG-based 
approach  in  favour  of  a  pure TEI  schema. This  simpliﬁ cation 
of the ﬁ le format will, we hope, make it much easier for end-
users to integrate markup produced using the IMT into Web 
applications and other projects.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Further developments in the IMT are projected over the next 
few  months. The  current  version  of  the  application  is  really 
focused  on  marking  up  the  single,  standalone  images  which 
are  central  to  the  Mariage  project.  However,  <facsimile>  is 
described in the TEI Guidelines as containing “a representation 
of some written source in the form of a set of images rather 
than  as  transcribed  or  encoded  text”  (TEI  Consortium 
2007, 11.1). The IMT really ought to be capable of producing 
documents  which  contain  multiple  images,  and  we  plan  to 
extend it to make this possible.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Rescuing old data: Case 
studies, tools and techniques

  University of Victoria, Canada  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Much  of  the  work  done  by  digital  humanists  could  arguably 
be described as “rescuing old data”. Digitizing texts is a way 
of rescuing them from obsolescence, from obscurity, or from 
physical  degradation.  However,  digitizing  in  itself  does  not 
amount to permanent rescue; it is merely transformation, and 
digital texts have turned out to have lifetimes vastly shorter 
than printed texts. As Besser pointed out in 1999, 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>“Though  most  people  tend  to  think  that  (unlike  analog 
information) digital information will last forever, we fail to 
realize  the  fragility  of  digital  works.  Many  large  bodies  of 
digital  information  (such  as  signiﬁ cant  parts  of  the Viking 
Mars mission) have been lost due to deterioration of the 
magnetic  tapes  that  they  reside  on.  But  the  problem  of 
storage media deterioration pales in comparison with the 
problems of rapidly changing storage devices and changing 
ﬁ le formats. It is almost impossible today to read ﬁ les off of 
the 8-inch ﬂ oppy disks that were popular just 20 years ago, 
and trying to decode Wordstar ﬁ les from just a dozen years 
ago can be a nightmare. Vast amounts of digital information 
from just 20 years ago is, for all practical purposes, lost.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As  Kirschenbaum  (2007)  says, “The  wholesale  migration  of 
literature to a born-digital state places our collective literary 
and  cultural  heritage  at  real  risk.”  To  illustrate  this  point, 
consider that searches for the original news source of Besser’s 
claim about the Viking Mars mission reveal links to articles in 
Yahoo, Reuters, and Excite, but all of these documents are now 
unavailable. Only the Internet Archive has a copy of the story 
(Krolicki 2001).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Case Study #1: The Nxaʔamxcín 
(Moses) Dictionary Database
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>During the 1960s and 70s, the late M. Dale Kincaid did ﬁ eldwork 
with  native  speakers  of  Nxaʔamxcín  (Moses),  an  aboriginal 
Salish language. His ﬁ eldnotes were in the form of a huge set 
of  index  cards  detailing  vocabulary  items,  morphology  and 
sample sentences. In the early 1990s, the data from the index 
cards was digitized using a system based on a combination of 
Lexware and WordPerfect, running on DOS, with the goal of 
compiling  a  print  dictionary. The  project  stalled  after  a  few 
years, although most of the data had been digitized; the data 
itself was left stored on an old desktop computer. When this 
computer  ﬁ nally  refused  to  boot,  rescuing  the  data  became 
urgent, and the WordPerfect ﬁ les were retrieved from its hard 
drive. We  then  had  to  decide  what  could  usefully  be  done 
with it. Luckily, we had printouts of the dictionary entries as 
processed by the Lexware/WordPerfect system, so we knew 
what the original output was supposed to look like. The data 
itself was in WordPerfect ﬁ les.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The  natural  approach  to  converting  this  data  would  be  to 
open the ﬁ les in an more recent version of WordPerfect, or 
failing that, a version contemporary with the ﬁ les themselves. 
However, this was not effective, because the ﬁ les themselves 
were unusual. In addition to the standard charset, at least two 
other charsets were used, along with an obsolete set of printer 
fonts, which depended on a particular brand of printer, and a 
speciﬁ c Hercules graphics card. In addition, the original fonts 
were customized to add extra glyphs, and a range of macros 
were used. In fact, even the original authors were not able to 
see  the  correct  characters  on  screen  as  they  worked;  they 
had to proof their work from printouts. When the ﬁ les were 
opened  in WordPerfect,  unusual  characters  were  visible,  but 
they were not the “correct” characters, and even worse, some 
instances of distinct characters in the original were collapsed 
into  identical  representations  in  WordPerfect.  Attempts  to 
open the ﬁ les in other word processors failed similarly.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Another  obvious  approach  would  be  to  use  libwpd,  a  C++ 
library  designed  for  processing  WordPerfect  documents, 
which is used by OpenOfﬁ ce.org and other word-processing 
programs. This would involve writing handlers for the events 
triggered  during  the  document  read  process,  analysing  the 
context and producing the correct Unicode characters. Even 
given the fact that libwpd has only “Support for a substantial 
portion  of  the  WordPerfect  extended  character  set”,  this 
technique might well have succeeded, but the tool created as 
a  result  would  have  been  speciﬁ c  only  to WordPerfect  ﬁ les, 
and to this project in particular. We decided that with a similar 
investment  of  time,  we  would  be  able  to  develop  a  more 
generally-useful tool; in particular, we wanted to create a tool 
which could be used by a non-programmer to do a similar task 
in the future. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper will examine two cases in which we have recently 
had  to  rescue  digitized  content  from  neardeath,  and  discuss 
some tools and techniques which we developed in the process, 
some of which are available for public use. Our experiences 
have taught us a great deal, not just about how to go about 
retrieving  data  from  obsolete  formats,  but  also  about  how 
better  to  protect  the  data  we  are  generating  today  from 
obsolescence. Our paper is not intended to address the issue 
of digital preservation (how best to prevent good digital data 
from falling into obsolescence); an extensive literature already 
exists addressing this problem (Vogt-O’Connor 1999, Besser 
1999,  and  others). The  fact  is  that,  despite  our  best  efforts, 
bit-rot  is  inexorable,  and  software  and  data  formats  always 
tend  towards  obsolescence. We  are  concerned,  here,  with 
discussing the techniques we have found effective in rescuing 
data which has already become difﬁ cult to retrieve.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Comparing the contents of the ﬁ les, viewed in a hex editor, to 
the printouts, we determined that the ﬁ les consisted of:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>From  here,  our  task  was  in  two  stages:  to  go  from  the  hat-
notation data to a Unicode representation, like this:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>-blocks of binary information we didn’t need (WordPerfect 
ﬁ le headers)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>-blocks of recognizable text
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>-blocks of “encoded text”, delimited by non-printing 
characters
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  control  characters  signal  switches  between  various 
WordPerfect  character  sets,  enabling  the  printing  of  non-
ascii  characters  using  the  special  printer  fonts.  Our  task 
was  to  convert  this  data  into  Unicode. This  was  essentially 
an  enormous  search-and-replace  project.  Here  is  a  sample 
section from the source data:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(where  [EOT]  =  end  of  transmission,  [BEL]  =  bell,  [SOH]  = 
start of header, [SO] = shift out, and [US] = unit separator). 
This  image  shows  the  original  print  output  from  this  data, 
including the rather cryptic labels such as “11tr” which were 
to be used by Lexware to generate the dictionary structure:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>and thence to a TEI XML representation:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In the ﬁ rst stage, we established a table of mappings between 
control  character  sequences  and  Unicode  sequences. 
However,  dozens  of  such  sequences  in  our  data  contained 
overlaps;  one  sequence  mapping  to  one  character  might 
appear  as  a  component  of  a  larger  sequence  mapping  to  a 
different character. In other words, if we were to reconstruct 
the  data  using  search-and-replace  operations,  the  order  of 
those operations would be crucial; and in order to ﬁ x upon 
the  optimal  progression  for  the  many  operations  involved, 
some kind of debugging environment would be needed.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  gave  rise  to  the Windows  application Transformer,  an 
open-source program designed for Unicodebased search-and-
replace operations. It provides an environment for specifying, 
sequencing and testing multiple search-and-replace operations 
on  a  text  ﬁ le,  and  then  allows  the  resulting  sequence  to  be 
run  against  a  batch  of  many  ﬁ les.  This  screenshot  shows 
Transformer at work on one of the Moses data ﬁ les.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Working  with  the  binary  data,  especially  in  the  context  of 
creating  a  search-and-replace  tool,  was  problematic,  so  we 
transformed  this  into  a  pure  text  representation  which  we 
could work with in a Unicode text editor. This was done using 
the  Linux “cat”  command. The  command “cat  -v  input_ﬁ le 
>  output_ﬁ le”  takes  “input_ﬁ le”  and  prints  all  characters, 
including non-printing characters, to “output_ﬁ le”, with what 
the cat manual refers to as “nonprinting characters” encoded 
in “hat notation”. This took us from this:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>normally leading to a decision or response by a government 
minister. These documents are held in archives in BC, Toronto 
and  in  the  UK,  and  were  transcribed  both  from  originals 
and  from  microﬁ lm.  It  would  be  difﬁ cult  to  overestimate 
the  historical  signiﬁ cance  of  this  digital  archive,  and  also  its 
contemporary relevance to the treaty negotiations which are 
still going on between First Nations and the BC and Canadian 
governments.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  transcriptions  take  the  form  of  about  9,000  text  ﬁ les 
in Waterloo  SCRIPT,  a  markup  language  used  primarily  for 
preparing print documents. 28 volumes of printed text were 
generated from the original SCRIPT ﬁ les, and several copies 
still exist. The scale of the archive, along with the multithreaded 
and  intermittent  nature  of  the  correspondence,  delayed  as 
it  was  by  the  lengthy  transmission  times  and  the  range  of 
different government ofﬁ ces and agents who might be involved 
in any given issue, make this material very well-suited to digital 
publication  (and  rather  unwieldy  and  difﬁ cult  to  navigate  in 
print form). Our challenge is converting the original script ﬁ les 
to P5 XML.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  is  an  example  of  the  Waterloo  Script  used  in  this 
project:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  can  see  here  the  transcribed  text,  interspersed  with 
structural  milestones  (.par;),  editorial  annotations  such  as 
index callouts and footnote links, and other commands such 
as .adr, which are actually user-deﬁ ned macros that invoke sets 
of formatting instructions, but which are useful to us because 
they help identify and categorize information (addresses, dates, 
etc.). Although this is structured data, it is far from from ideal. 
It  is  procedural  rather  than  hierarchical  (we  can  see  where 
a paragraph begins, but we have to infer where it ends); it is 
only partially descriptive; and it mixes editorial content with 
transcription.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This is rather more of a challenge than the Moses data; it is much 
more  varied  and  more  loosely  structured.  Even  if  a  generic 
converter for Waterloo SCRIPT ﬁ les were available (we were 
unable to ﬁ nd any working converter which produced useful 
output  such  as  XML),  it  would  essentially  do  no  more  than 
produce  styling/printing  instructions  in  a  different  format;  it 
would not be able to infer the document structure, or convert 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ability to test and re-test replacement sequences proved 
crucial, as we discovered that the original data was inconsistent. 
Data-entry  practices  had  changed  over  the  lifetime  of  the 
project. By testing against a range of ﬁ les from different periods 
and different data-entry operators, we were able to devise a 
sequence  which  produced  reliable  results  across  the  whole 
set, and transform all the data in one operation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Having  successfully  created  Unicode  representations  of  the 
data,  we  were  now  able  to  consider  how  to  convert  the 
results  to  TEI  XML.  The  dataset  was  in  fact  hierarchically 
structured, using a notation system which was designed to be 
processed by Lexware. First, we were able to transform it into 
XML  using  the  Lexware  Band2XML  converter  (http://www.
ling.unt.edu/~montler/convert/Band2xml.htm);  then  an  XSLT 
transformation took us to TEI P5.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  XML  is  now  being  proofed  and  updated,  and  an  XML 
database application is being developed.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Case Study #2: The Colonial 
Despatches project
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>During  the  1980s  and  1990s,  a  team  of  researchers  at  the 
University of Victoria, led by James Hendrickson, transcribed 
virtually  the  entire  correspondence  between  the  colonies 
of  British  Columbia  and Vancouver  Island  and  the  Colonial 
Ofﬁ ce  in  London,  from  the  birth  of  the  colonies  until  their 
incorporation into the Dominion of Canada. These documents 
include  not  only  the  despatches  (the  spelling  with “e”  was 
normal  in  the  period)  between  colonial  governors  and  the 
bureacracy  in  London;  each  despatch  received  in  London 
went through a process of successive annotation, in the form 
of bureaucratic “minutes”, through which its signiﬁ cance was 
discussed, and appropriate responses or actions were mooted,

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(say)  a  very  varied  range  of  handwritten  date  formats  into 
formal date representations. To create useful TEI XML ﬁ les, we 
need  processing  which  is  able  to  make  complex  inferences 
from the data, in order to determine for instance where for 
example an <opener> begins and ends; decide what constitutes 
a  <salute></salute>;  or  parse  a  human-readable  text  string 
such as “12719, CO 60/1, p. 207; received 14 December” into 
a structured reference in XML.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>width,  and  so  on,  designed  to  lay  them  out  effectively  on  a 
page printed by a monospace printer. The speciﬁ c formatting 
information was not representative of anything in the original 
documents  (the  original  documents  are  handwritten,  and 
very roughly laid out); rather, it was aimed speciﬁ cally at the 
print process. In cases like this, it was more efﬁ cient simply to 
encode the tables manually.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The most effective approach here was to write routines speciﬁ c 
to these texts and the macros and commands used in them. 
As in the Moses project, we used the technique of stringing 
together  a  set  of  discrete  operations,  in  an  environment 
where  they  could  be  sequenced,  and  individual  operations 
could  be  turned  on  and  off,  while  viewing  the  results  on 
individual  texts. We  gutted  the  original Transformer  tool  to 
create  a  shell  within  which  routines  programmed  directly 
into the application were used in place of search-and-replace 
operations. The resulting interface provides the same options 
for  sequencing  and  suppressing  operations,  and  for  running 
batch conversions on large numbers of ﬁ les, but the underlying 
code for each operation is project-speciﬁ c, and compiled into 
the application.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This screenshot shows the application at work on a despatch 
ﬁ le:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  project  collection  also  contains  some  unencoded 
transcription in the form of Word 5 documents. To retrieve this 
data and other similar relics, we have built a virtual machine 
running Windows 3.11, and populated it with DOS versions of 
Word, WordStar and WordPerfect. This machine also provides 
an  environment  in  which  we  can  run  the  still-famous TACT 
suite of DOS applications for text-analysis. The virtual machine 
can be run under the free VMWare Server application, and we 
hope to make it available on CD-ROM at the presentation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The data ﬁ les in both the projects we have discussed above 
were  all  in  standard,  documented  formats.  Nevertheless,  no 
generic  conversion  tool  or  process  could  have  been  used 
to  transform  this  data  into  XML,  while  preserving  all  of  the 
information  inherent  in  it. We  were  faced  with  three  core 
problems:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- Idiosyncracy. Waterloo SCRIPT may be well documented, 
but any given corpus is likely to use macros written 
speciﬁ cally for it. WordPerfect ﬁ les may be documented, but 
issues with character sets and obsolete fonts can render 
them unreadable. Every project is unique.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- Inconsistency. Encoding practices evolve over time, and 
no project of any size will be absolutely consistent, or free 
of human error. The conversion process must be ﬂ exible 
enough to accommodate this; and we must also recognize 
that there is a point at which it becomes more efﬁ cient to 
give up, and ﬁ x the last few ﬁ les or bugs manually.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- Non-explicit information. Much of the information 
we need to recover, and encode explicitly, is not present in 
a mechanical form in the original document. For example, 
only context can tell us that the word “Sir” constitutes a 
<salute>; this is evident to a human reader of the original 
encoding or its printed output, but not obvious to a 
conversion processor, unless highly speciﬁ c instructions are 
written for it.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The bulk of the original SCRIPT ﬁ les were converted in this 
way, at a “success rate” of around 98% --meaning that at least 
98%  of  the  ﬁ les  were  converted  to  well-formed  XML,  and 
proved valid against the generic P5 schema used for the project. 
The remaining ﬁ les (around 150) were partially converted, and 
then edited manually to bring them into compliance. Some of 
these  ﬁ les  contained  basic  errors  in  their  original  encoding 
which  precluded  successful  conversion.  Others  were  too 
idiosyncratic and complex to be worth handling in code. For 
instance,  27  of  the  ﬁ les  contained “tables”  (i.e.  data  laid  out 
in tabular format), each with distinct formatting settings, tab 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In Transformer, we have attempted to create a tool which can 
be used for many types of textual data (and we have since used 
it on many other projects). Rather than create a customized 
conversion tool for a single project, we have tried to create 
an environment for creating, testing and applying conversion 
scenarios. We are currently planning to add scripting support 
to  the  application.  For  the  Colonial  Despatches  project,  we 
resorted  to  customizing  the  application  by  adding  speciﬁ c 
application  code  to  accomplish  the  conversion.  A  scripting

code in script form, and combine it with conventional search-
and-replace operations in a single process, without modifying 
the application itself.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Although  this  paper  does  not  focus  on  digital  preservation, 
it  is  worth  noting  that  once  data  has  been  rescued,  every 
effort should be made to encode and store it in such a way 
that  it  does  not  require  rescuing  again  in  the  future.  Good 
practices  include  use  of  standard  ﬁ le  formats,  accompanying 
documentation,  regular  migration  as  described  in  Besser 
(1999), and secure, redundant storage. To these we would add 
a recommendation to print out all your data; this may seem 
excessive,  but  if  all  else  fails,  the  printouts  will  be  essential, 
and  they  last  a  long  time.  Neither  of  the  rescue  projects 
described above would have been practical without access to 
the  printed  data.  Dynamic  rendering  systems  (such  as Web 
sites  that  produce  PDFs  or  HTML  pages  on  demand,  from 
database back-ends) should be able to output all the data in 
the form of static ﬁ les which can be saved. The dynamic nature 
of  such  repositories  is  a  great  boon  during  development, 
and especially if they continue to grow and to be edited, but 
one  day  there  may  be  no  PHP  or  XSLT  processor  that  can 
generate the output, and someone may be very glad to have 
those static ﬁ les. We would also recommend creating virtual 
machines for such complex systems; if your project depends 
on Tomcat, Cocoon and eXist, it will be difﬁ cult to run when 
there are no contemporary Java Virtual Machines.

Linguistics: A new approach 
to creating editions of 
historical manuscripts

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One relatively unexplored area in the expanding ﬁ eld of digital 
humanities  is  the  interface  between  textual  and  contextual 
studies, namely linguistics and history. Up to now, few digital 
editions of historical texts have been designed with linguistic 
study  in  mind.  Equally  few  linguistic  corpora  have  been 
designed  with  the  needs  of  historians  in  mind. This  paper 
introduces a new interdisciplinary project, Digital Editions for 
Corpus Linguistics (DECL). The aim of the project is to create 
a model for new, linguistically oriented online digital editions 
of historical manuscripts. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital  editions,  while  on  a  theoretical  level  clearly  more 
useful  to  scholars  than  print  editions,  have  not  yet  become 
the norm for publishing historical texts. To some extent this 
can be argued to result from the lack of a proper publishing 
infrastructure and user-friendly tools (Robinson 2005), which 
limit  the  possibilities  of  individual  scholars  and  small-scale 
projects to produce digital editions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The practical approach taken by the DECL project is to develop 
a  detailed  yet  ﬂ exible  framework  for  producing  electronic 
editions of historical manuscript texts. Initially, the development 
of this framework will be based on and take place concurrently 
with the work on three digital editions of Late Middle and Early 
Modern English manuscript material. Each of these editions—a 
Late  Medieval  bilingual  medical  handbook,  a  family  of  15th-
century  culinary  recipe  collections,  and  a  collection  of  early 
17th-century intelligence letters—will serve both as a template 
for the encoding guidelines for that particular text type and 
as a development platform for the common toolset. Together, 
the toolset and the encoding guidelines are designed to enable 
editors  of  manuscript  material  to  create  digital  editions  of 
their material with reasonable ease.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Theoretical background
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The theoretical basis of the project is dually grounded in the 
ﬁ elds  of  manuscript  studies  and  corpus  linguistics. The  aim 
of  the  project  is  to  create  a  solid  pipeline  from  the  former 
to  the  latter:  to  facilitate  the  representation  of  manuscript 
reality  in  a  form  that  is  amenable  to  corpus  linguistic  study. 
Since context and different kinds of metatextual features are 
important sources of information for such ﬁ elds as historical 
pragmatics,  sociolinguistics  and  discourse  analysis,  the  focus 
must be equally on document, text and context. By document we 
refer to the actual manuscript, by text to the linguistic contents 
of  the  document,  and  by  context  to  both  the  historical  and 
linguistic circumstances relating to text and the document. In 
practice this division of focus means that all of these levels are 
considered equally important facets of the manuscript reality 
and are thus to be represented in the edition. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On  the  level  of  the  text,  DECL  adopts  the  opinion  of  Lass 
(2004),  that  a  digital  edition  should  preserve  the  text  as 
accurately and faithfully as possible, convey it in as ﬂ exible a 
form  as  possible,  and  ensure  that  any  editorial  intervention 
remains visible and reversible. We also adopt a similar approach 
with  respect  to  the  document  and  its  context:  the  editorial 
framework should enable and facilitate the accurate encoding 
and  presentation  of  both  the  diplomatic  and  bibliographical 
features  of  the  document,  and  the  cultural,  situational  and 
textual contexts of both the document and the text. In keeping 
with the aforementioned aims, the development of both the 
editions, and the tools and guidelines for producing them, will 
be guided by the following three principles.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Flexibility
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The editions seek to offer a ﬂ exible user interface that will be 
easy to use and enable working with various levels of the texts, 
as  well  as  selecting  the  features  of  the  text,  document  and 
context that are to be included in the presentation or analysis 
of the text. All editions produced within the framework will 
build  on  similar  logic  and  general  principles,  which  will  be 
ﬂ exible  enough  to  accommodate  the  speciﬁ c  needs  of  any 
text type.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Transparency
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The user interfaces of the editions will include all the features 
that have become expected in digital editions. But in addition 
to  the  edited  text  and  facsimile  images  of  the  manuscripts, 
the  user  will  also  be  able  to  access  the  raw  transcripts  and 
all  layers  of  annotation. This  makes  all  editorial  intervention 
transparent  and  reversible,  and  enables  the  user  to  evaluate 
any editorial decisions. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Expandability
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The editions will be built with future expansion and updating in 
mind. This expandability will be three-dimensional in the sense 
that  new  editions  can  be  added  and  linked  to  existing  ones, 
and  both  new  documents  and  new  layers  of  annotation  or 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
132
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>information can be added to existing editions. Furthermore, the 
editions will not be hardwired to a particular software solution, 
and their texts can be freely downloaded and processed for 
analysis  with  external  software  tools.  The  editions  will  be 
maintained  on  a  web  server  and  will  be  compatible  with  all 
standards-compliant web browsers. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ﬁ rst DECL editions are being compiled at the Research 
Unit for Variation, Contacts and Change in English (VARIENG) 
at the University of Helsinki, and will form the bases for three 
doctoral  dissertations. These  editions,  along  with  a  working 
toolset and guidelines, are scheduled to be available within the 
next ﬁ ve years. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Technical methods
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Following  the  aforementioned  principles,  the  electronic 
editions produced by the project will reproduce the features 
of  the  manuscript  text  as  a  faithful  diplomatic  transcription, 
into which linguistic, palaeographic and codicological features 
will be encoded, together with associated explanatory notes 
elucidating the contents and various contextual aspects of the 
text. The encoding standard used for the editions will be based 
on and compliant with the latest incarnation of the TEI XML 
standard (P5, published 1.11.2007), with any text-type speciﬁ c 
features incorporated as additional modules to the TEI schema. 
The XML-based encoding will enable the editions to be used 
with  any  XML-aware  tools  and  easily  converted  to  other 
document or database standards. In addition to the annotation 
describing the properties of the document, text and context, 
further  layers  of  annotation—e.g.  linguistic  analysis—can  be 
added to the text later on utilising the provisions made in the 
TEI P5 standard for standoff XML markup.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The editorial strategies and annotation practices of the three 
initial editions will be carefully coordinated and documented 
to  produce  detailed  guidelines,  enabling  the  production  of 
further  compatible  electronic  editions. The  tools  developed 
concurrently  with  and  tested  on  the  editions  themselves 
will  make  use  of  existing  open  source  models  and  software 
projects—such  as  GATE  or  Heart  of  Gold,  teiPublisher  and 
Xaira—to make up a sophisticated yet customisable annotation 
and delivery system. The TEI-based encoding standard will also 
be compatible with the ISO/TC 37/SC 4 standard, facilitating 
the linguistic annotation of the text. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Expected results
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One  premise  of  this  project  is  that  creating  digital  editions 
based  on  diplomatic  principles  will  help  raise  the  usefulness 
of  digitised  historical  texts  by  broadening  their  scope  and 
therefore  also  interest  in  them.  Faithful  reproduction  of  the 
source  text  is  a  requisite  for  historical  corpus  linguistics, 
but  editions  based  on  diplomatic  transcripts  of  manuscript 
sources are equally amenable to historical or literary enquiry. 
Combining the approaches of different disciplines—historical 
linguistics,  corpus  linguistics,  history—to  creating  electronic 
text  databases  should  lead  to  better  tools  for  all  disciplines 
involved  and  increase  interdisciplinary  communication  and 
cooperation.  If  they  prove  to  be  successful,  the  tools  and 
guidelines developed by DECL will also be readily applicable 
to  the  editing  and  publication  of  other  types  of  material, 
providing a model for integrating the requirements and desires 
of different disciplines into a single solution. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Since  the  aim  of  the  DECL  project  is  to  produce  an  open 
access  model  for  multipurpose  and  multidisciplinary  digital 
editions,  both  the  editions  created  by  the  DECL  project 
and  the  tools  and  guidelines  used  in  their  production  will 
be published online under an open access license. While the 
project strongly advocates open access publication of scholarly 
work, it also acknowledges that this may not be possible due 
to ongoing issues with copyright, for example in the case of 
facsimile images.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The DECL project is also intended to be open in the sense that 
participation or collaboration by scholars or projects working 
on historical manuscript materials is gladly welcomed.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>novels  conﬁ rm  that  Collins  is  easily  distinguished  from  ﬁ ve 
of his contemporaries, as shown in Fig. I. For The Coquette, I 
have made the task more difﬁ cult by comparing Foster’s letter 
writers  to  those  of  ﬁ ve  other  late  18th-century  epistolary 
novels by ﬁ ve authors. I separated all the letters by writer and 
addressee  and  retaining    only  the  22  writers  with  the  most 
letters, then combined the letters between each single writer 
and  addressee  and  cut  the  combined  texts  into  42  sections 
of  about  3,500  words.  Both  Delta  and  cluster  analysis  do  a 
good  job  on  this  difﬁ cult  task,  and  many  Delta  analyses  give 
completely  correct  results.  Cluster  analysis  is  slightly  less 
accurate,  but  several  analyses  are  correct  for  ﬁ ve  of  the  six 
authors; they also show that individual letter writers strongly 
tend to group together within the cluster for each novel (see 
Fig. 2).

quette: Narrative and Episto-
lary Styles

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In his seminal work on Austen, John F. Burrows demonstrates 
that  characters  can  be  distinguished  from  each  another  on 
the  basis  of  the  frequencies  of  the  most  frequent  words  of 
their dialogue treating the characters as if they were authors 
(1987). Computational stylistics has also been used to study 
the  distinctive  interior  monologues  of  Joyce’s  characters  in 
Ulysses  (McKenna  and Antonia  1996),  the  styles  of  Charles 
Brockden  Brown’s  narrators  (Stewart  2003),  style  variation 
within a novel (Hoover 2003), and the interaction of character 
separation and translation (Rybicki 2006). Here I address two 
kinds of local style variation: the multiple narrators of Wilkie 
Collins’s The Moonstone (1868) and the multiple letter writers 
in Hannah Webster Foster’s sentimental American epistolary 
novel The Coquette (1797).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Moonstone  has  several  narrators  whose  styles  seem 
intuitively distinct, though all the narrations share plot elements, 
characters,  and  physical  and  cultural  settings.  The  Coquette, 
based  on  an  infamous  true  story,  and  very  popular  when  it 
was published,  is read today more for its cultural signiﬁ cance 
and  its  proto-feminist  tendencies  than  for  its  literary  merit. 
Nevertheless,  one  would  expect  the    coquette,  the  evil 
seducer,  the  virtuous  friend,  and  the  disappointed  suitor  to 
write distinctively. Treating the narrators and letter writers of 
these two novels as different authors will test how successfully 
Collins and Foster distinguish their voices and shed light on 
some practical and theoretical issues of authorship and style.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Examining  the  individual  novels  reveals  a  sharp  contrast: 
Collins’s  narrators  are  internally  consistent  and  easy  to 
distinguish, while Foster’s letter writers are much less internally 
consistent and much more difﬁ cult to distinguish. For Collins, 
cluster  analysis  consistently  groups  all  narrative  sections  of 
6 of the 7 narrators. When a modiﬁ ed technique developed 
especially for investigating intra-textual style variation is used 
(Hoover  2003),  the  results  are  even  better. As  Fig.  3  shows, 
all sections by all narrators sometimes cluster correctly (the 
sections range from 4,300 to 6,900 words).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>“Tuning” the analysis to produce better clustering may seem 
circular  in  an  analysis  that  tests  whether  Collins’s  narrators 
have consistent idiolects. But this objection can be answered by 
noting the consistency of the groupings. The stable clustering 
across  large  ranges  of  analyses  with  different  numbers  of 
MFW  that  is  found  here  is  obviously  more  signiﬁ cant  than 
frequently-changing clustering.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Note also that the sections strongly tend to occur in narrative 
order in Fig. 3: every two-section cluster consists of contiguous 
sections. This “echo”  of  narrative  structure  provides  further 
evidence  that  the  analysis  is  accurately  characterizing  the 
narrators’ styles.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Computational  stylistics  cannot  be  applied  to  narrators 
and  letter  writers  of  these  novels,  however,  unless  they  can 
distinguish  Collins  and  Foster  from  their  contemporaries.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>could argue that Boyer’s letters to Selby should be different  
from  his  letters  to  Eliza,  and  perhaps  it  is  appropriate  that 
Eliza’s  last  section  includes  only  despairing  letters  written 
after Boyer has rejected her. Yet such special pleading is almost 
always  possible  after  the  fact.  Further,  any  suggestion  that 
Boyer’s letters to Eliza should be distinct from those to Selby 
is  impossible  to  reconcile  with  the  fact  that  they  cluster  so 
consistently with Eliza’s early letters to Lucy. And if Eliza’s early 
and late letters should be distinct, it is difﬁ cult understand the 
clustering of the early letters with those of Boyer to Selby and 
the consistent clustering of the late letters with Lucy’s letters 
to Eliza. It is difﬁ cult to avoid the conclusion that Foster has 
simply  failed  to  create  distinct  and  consistent  characters  in 
The Coquette.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A ﬁ ne-grained investigation of The Moonstone involving smaller 
sections and including more narrators puts Collins’s ability to 
differentiate his narrators to a sterner test, but some cluster 
analyses are again completely correct. The distinctiveness of the 
narrators of The Moonstone is thus conﬁ rmed by computational 
stylistics:  the  narrators  behave  very  much  as  if  they  were 
literally  different  authors.  Given  the  length  of  the  novel,  the 
generic constraints of narrative, and the inherent similarities 
of plot and setting, this is a remarkable achievement.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  contrast,  Fanny  Burney,  whose  Evelina  is  included  in  the 
novels  compared  with  The  Coquette,  above,  creates  very 
distinct  voices  for  the  letter  writers. Although  only  four  of 
the  writers  have  parts  large  enough  for  reasonable  analysis, 
Evelina writes to both her adoptive father Mr. Villars and her 
friend  Miss  Mirvan,  and Villars  writes  both  to  Evelina  and 
to  Lady  Howard.  One  might  expect  signiﬁ cant  differences 
between  letters  to  these  very  different  addressees.  Evelina’s 
style might also be expected to change over the course of this 
bildungsroman. However, analyses of all 34 sections of letters 
from  Evelina  (approximately  2,500  words  long),  show  that 
Burney’s  characters  are  much  more  distinct  and  consistent 
than  Foster’s,  as  a  representative  analysis  shows  (see  Fig.  5). 
This dendogram also strongly reﬂ ects the narrative structure 
of the novel. Burney, like Collins, is very successful in creating 
distinctive voices for her characters.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Criticism  of  Foster’s  novel  has  paid  little  attention  to  the 
different voices of the characters, but what commentary there 
is  does  not  suggest  that  the  patterns  shown  above  should 
have been predictable. Smith-Rosenberg, for example, suggests 
a contrast between Eliza and “the feminized Greek chorus of 
Richman,  Freeman,  and  Eliza’s  widowed  mother,  who,  at  the 
end, can only mouth hollow platitudes” (2003: 35). Although 
these  women  and  Julia  are  often  considered  a  monolithic 
group urging conventional morality, the distinctness of Julia’s 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For my analysis of The Coquette, I have added 3 more sections 
of letters, so that there are 13 sections of approximately 3,000 
words by 6 writers, with separate sections by a single writer 
to  two  different  addressees. Although  these  sections  should 
be considerably easier to group than those in the ﬁ ne-grained 
analysis  of  The  Moonstone,  the  results  are  not  encouraging.  
Cluster  analyses  based  on  the  300-700  MFW  produce  very 
similar but not very accurate results, in all of which letters by 
Boyer and Eliza appear in both main clusters (see Fig. 4). Lucy’s 
letters to Eliza also cluster with the last section of Eliza’s letters 
to Lucy in all of these analyses a misidentiﬁ cation as strong as 
any correct one. In a real authorship attribution problem, such 
results would not support the conclusion that all of Boyer’s 
or Eliza’s letters were written by a single author. Perhaps one

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>sections,  especially  from  Lucy’s  (see  Fig.  5)  might  suggest 
a  reexamination  of  this  notion,  and  might  reveal  how  the 
styles  of  Julia  and  the  other  women  are  related  to  more 
signiﬁ cant  differences  of  opinion,  character,  or  principle. 
Various suggestions about changes in Eliza over the course of 
the novel might also beneﬁ t from a closer investigation of the 
language  of  the  letters.  Because  Foster’s  novel  is  of  interest 
chieﬂ y on cultural, historical, and political grounds rather than 
literary ones, however, such an investigation is more likely to 
advance  the  theory  and  practice  of  computational  stylistics 
than the criticism of The Coquette. It is clear, at any rate, that 
computational stylistics is adequate to the task of distinguishing 
narrators and letter writers, so long as the author is adequate 
to the same task.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Term Discovery in an Early 
Modern Latin Scientiﬁ c 
Corpus 
 Malcolm D. Hyman 
hyman@mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de
 Max Planck Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte  , Germany
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  paper  presents  the  results  of  a  pilot  project  aimed  at 
the  development  of  automatic  techniques  for  the  discovery 
of  salient  technical  terminology  in  a  corpus  of  Latin  texts. 
These  texts  belong  to  the  domain  of  mechanics  and  date 
from  the  last  quarter  of  the  sixteenth  and  the  ﬁ rst  quarter 
of  the  seventeenth  century,  a  period  of  intense  intellectual 
activity in which engineers and scientists explored the limits 
of the Aristotelian and Archimedean paradigms in mechanics. 
The tensions that arose ultimately were resolved by the new 
“classical  mechanics”  inaugurated  by  Newton’s  Principia  in 
1687 (cf. Damerow et al. 2004).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  work  presented  here  forms  part  of  a  larger  research 
project aimed at developing new computational techniques to 
assist historians in studying ﬁ ne-grained developments in long-
term intellectual traditions, such as the tradition of Western 
mechanics that begins with the pseudo-Aristotelian Problemata 
Mechanica (ca. 330 B.C.E.). This research is integrated with two 
larger institutional projects: the working group “Mental Models 
in the History of Mechanics” at the Max Planck Institute for 
the History of Science in Berlin, and the German DFG-funded 
Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 644 “Transformations 
of Antiquity.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The purpose of this paper is to present initial results regarding 
the  development  of  efﬁ cient  methods  for  technical  term 
discovery in Early Modern scientiﬁ c Latin. The focus is on the 
identiﬁ cation  of  term  variants  and  on  term  enrichment. The 
methodology employed is inspired by Jacquemin (2001), whose 
approach  allows  for  the  use  of  natural  language  processing 
techniques without the need for full syntactic parsing, which is 
currently not technically feasible for Latin.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  present  paper  extends  prior  work  in  term  discovery 
along two vectors. First, work in term discovery has primarily 
addressed  the  languages  of  Western  Europe  (especially 
English  and  French),  with  some  work  also  in  Chinese  and 
Japanese. Latin presents some typological features that require 
modiﬁ cations to established techniques. Chief among these is 
the  rich  inﬂ ectional  morphology  (both  nominal  and  verbal) 
of Latin, which is a language of the synthetic type. Latin also 
exhibits  non-projectivity,  i.e.  syntactic  constituents  may  be 
represented non-continuously (with the intrusion of elements 
from  foreign  constituents). Although  the  non-projectivity  of 
Renaissance Latin is considerably less than what is found in the 
artistic prose (and a fortiori poetry) of the Classical language 
(Bamman  and  Crane  2006),  term  detection  must  proceed 
within a framework that allows for both non-projectivity and 
(relatively) free word order within constituents.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Second, researchers in the ﬁ eld of term discovery have focused 
almost  exclusively  on  contemporary  scientiﬁ c  corpora  in 
domains  such  as  biomedicine.  In  contemporary  scientiﬁ c 
literature, technical terms are characterized by a particularly 
high degree of denotative monosemicity, exhibit considerable 
stability,  and  follow  quite  rigid  morphological,  syntactic,  and 
semantic  templates. Although  these  characteristics  are  also 
applicable to the terminology of Latin scientiﬁ c texts, they are 
applicable to a lesser degree. In other words, the distinction 
between  technical  terminology  and  ordinary 
language 
vocabulary is less clear cut than in the case of contemporary 
scientiﬁ c  and  technical  language.  The  lesser  degree  of 
monosemicity, stability, and structural rigidity of terminology 
holds  implications  for  automatic  term  discovery  in  corpora 
earlier than the twentieth (or at least nineteenth) century.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The corpus of Early Modern mechanics texts in Latin is well-
designed for carrying out experiments in adapting established 
techniques of term discovery to historical corpora. Mechanics 
is by this time a scientiﬁ c discipline that possesses an extensive 
repertoire  of  characteristic  concepts  and  terminology. Thus 
it is broadly comparable to contemporary scientiﬁ c corpora, 
while  still  presenting  unique  features  that  merit  special 
investigation.  Several  thousand  pages  of  text  are  available  in 
XML  format,  which  have  been  digitized  by  the Archimedes 
Project,  an  international  German/American  digital  library 
venture jointly funded by the DFG and NSF. It will be possible 
to extend future work to a multilingual context, by examining 
in addition closely-related vernacular works (in Italian, Spanish, 
and  German)  that  are  contemporary  with  the  Latin  corpus.

computationally-assisted framework for exploring conceptual

that  has  been  described  by  Hyman  (2007). This  framework 
employs  latent  semantic  analysis  (LSA)  and  techniques  for 
the visualization of semantic networks, allowing change in the 
semantic associations of terms to be studied within a historical 
corpus. The concluding section of the present paper will survey 
the applications of technical term discovery within historical 
corpora for the study of the conﬂ ict, competition, evolution,

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  paper  will  discuss    the  decisions  in  relation  to  markup 
which have been made in Textgrid. The ﬁ rst part of the paper 
will  describe  the  functionality  and  principal  architecture  of 
Textgrid,  the  second  part  will  discuss  Textgrid’s  baseline 
encoding.  Textgrid  is  a  modular  platform  for  collaborative 
textual editing and a ﬁ rst building block for a community grid 
for the humanities. Textgrid consists of a toolkit for creating 
and  working  with  digital  editions  and  a  repository  offering 
storage, archiving and retrieval. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Textgrid’s  architecture  follows  a  layered  design,  built  for 
openness on all levels. At its base there is a middleware layer 
providing  generic  utilities  to  encapsulate  and  provide  access 
to the data grid’s storage facilities as well as external archives. 
Additionally, indexing and retrieval facilities and generic services 
like authorisation and authentication are provided here.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A service layer built on the middleware provides automated 
text  processing  facilities  and  access  to  semantic  resources. 
Here,  Textgrid  offers  domain-speciﬁ c  services 
like  a 
conﬁ gurable streaming editor or a lemmatizer which uses the 
dictionaries stored in Textgrid. All services can be orchestrated 
in workﬂ ows, which may also include external services.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Every  service  deploys  standard  web  service  technologies. 
As  well,  tools  in  the  service  layer  can  work  with  both  data 
managed by the middleware and data streamed in and out of 
these  services  by  the  caller,  so  they  can  be  integrated  with 
environments outside of Textgrid.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The full tool suite of Textgrid is accessible via TextGridLab, a 
user interface based on Eclipse which, besides user interfaces 
to  the  services  and  search  and  management  facilities  for 
Textgrid’s  content,  also  includes  some  primarily  interactive 
tools. The  user  interface  provides  integrated  access  to  the 
various  tools:  For  example,  an  XML  Editor,  a  tool  to  mark 
up parts of an image and link it to the text, and a dictionary 
service. From the perspective of the user, all these tools are 
part of one application.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This software framework is completely based on plug-ins and 
thus  reﬂ ects  the  other  layers’  extensibility:  it  can  be  easily 
extended by plug-ins provided by third parties, and although 
there  is  a  standalone  executable  tailored  for  the  philologist 
users, TextGridLab’s  plugins  can  be  integrated  with  existing 
Eclipse installations, as well.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Additionally, the general public may read and search publicized 
material  by  means  of  a  web  interface,  without  installing  any 
specialized software.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Designing this infrastructure it would have been a possibility 
to deﬁ ne one data format which can be used in all services 
including  search  and  retrieval  and  publishing.  Instead  the 
designers chose a different approach: each service or software 
component deﬁ nes its own minimal level of format restriction. 
The XML editor, which is part of the front end, is designed to 
process all ﬁ les which are xml conform; the streaming editor 
service can handle any kind of ﬁ le etc.  The main reason for this 
decision was the experience of those people involved and the 
model of the TEI guidelines to allow users as much individual 
freedom to choose and use their markup as possible even if 
the success of TEI lite and the many project speciﬁ c TEI subsets 
seem to point to the need for deﬁ ning strict standards. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>But  at  some  points  of  the  project  more  restrictive  format 
decisions had to be made. One of them was the result of the 
project’s ambition to make all texts searchable in a way which 
is more useful than a mere full text search. On the other hand 
it  isn’t  realistic  to  propose  a  full  format  which  will  allow  all 
future editors, lexicographers and corpus designers to encode 
all features they are interested in.  So  Textgrid allows all projects 
to use whatever XML markup seems necessary but burdens 
the project with designing its own interface to these complex 
data structures. But in this form the project data are an island 
and there is no common retrieval possible. To allow a retrieval 
across all data in Textgrid which goes beyond the possibilities 
of a full text research, the Textgrid designers discussed several 
possibilities but ﬁ nally settled down on a concept which relies 
very much on text types like drama, prose, verse, letter etc. 
and we differentiate between basic text types like verse and 
container text types like corpora or critical editions.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Interproject  search  is  enabled  by  transforming  all  texts  into 
a  rudimentary  format  which  contains  the  most  important 
information of the speciﬁ c text type. This baseline encoding is 
not meant to be a core encoding which covers all important 
information  of  a  text  type  but  it  is  strictly  functional. We 
deﬁ ned three demands which should be met by the baseline 
encoding, which is meant to be a subset of the TEI: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1) Intelligent search. Including often used aspects of text 
types into the search we try to make text retrieval more 
effective. A typical example would be the ‘knowledge’ that a 
word is the lemma of a dictionary entry, so a search for this 
word would mark this subtree as a better hit than another 
where it is just part of a paragraph.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2) Representation of search results. The results of an inter-
project search have to be displayed in some manner which 
preserves some important aspects of the source texts. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3) Automatic reuse and further processing of text. A typical 
example for this would be the integration of a dictionary 
in a network of dictionaries. This aspect is notoriously

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>underrepresented in most design decisions of modern 
online editions which usually see the publication as the 
natural goal of their project, a publication which usually only 
allows for reading and searching as the typical forms of text 
usage. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our  paper  will  describe  the  baseline  encoding  format  for 
some of the text types supported by Textgrid at the moment 
including  the  metadata  format  and  discuss  in  what  ways  the 
three requirements are met by them. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One  of  the  aims  of  our  paper  is  to  put  our  arguments  and 
design  decisions  up  for  discussion  in  order  to  test  their 
validity. Another aim is to reﬂ ect on the consequences of this 
approach for others like the TEI, especially the idea to deﬁ ne 
important text types for the humanities and provide speciﬁ c 
markup for them.

the integration of research 
data, notes and referencing 
in a Web 2.0 academic 
framework 
 Ian R. Johnson

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  In  this  paper  I  argue  that  the  arbitrary  distinction  between 
bibliographic  data  and  research  data  –  which  we  see  in  the 
existence  of  specialised  library  catalogues  and  bibliographic 
systems  on  the  one  hand,  and  a  multitude  of  ad  hoc  notes, 
digitized sources, research databases and repositories on the 
other – is a hangover from a simpler past, in which publication 
and bibliographic referencing was a well-deﬁ ned and separate 
part of the research cycle.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Today  published  material  takes  many  different  forms,  from 
books  to  multimedia,  digital  artworks  and  performances. 
Research  data  results  from  collection  and  encoding  of 
information  in  museums,  archives,  libraries  and  ﬁ eldwork,  as 
well as output from analysis and interpretation. As new forms 
of digital publication appear, the boundary between published 
material  and  research  data  blurs.  Given  the  right  enabling 
structures  (eg.  peer  review)  and  tools  (eg.  collaborative 
editing), a simple digitized dataset can become as valuable as 
any  formal  publication  through  the  accretion  of  scholarship. 
When someone publishes their academic musings in a personal 
research blog, is it analogous to written notes on their desk 
(or desktop) or is it grey literature or vanity publishing?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The drawing of a distinction between bibliographic references 
and other forms of research data, and the storing of these data in 
distinct systems, hinders construction of the linkages between 
information which lie at the core of Humanities research. Why 
on earth would we want to keep our bibliographic references 
separate from our notes and developing ideas, or from data 
we might collect from published or unpublished sources? Yet 
standalone  desktop  silos  (such  as  EndNote  for  references, 
Word  for  notes  and  MSAccess  for  data)  actively  discourage 
the linking of these forms of information.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Bespoke or ad hoc databases admirably (or less than admirably) 
fulﬁ ll the particular needs of researchers, but fail to connect 
with  the  wider  world. These  databases  are  often  desktop-
based  and  inaccessible  to  anyone  but  the  user  of  their  host 
computer, other than through sharing of copies (with all the 
attendant  problems  of  redundancy,  maintenance  of  currency 
and merging of changes). When accessible they often lack multi-
user capabilities and/or are locked down to modiﬁ cation by a 
small group of users because of the difﬁ culties of monitoring 
and  rolling  back  erroneous  or  hostile  changes.  Even  when

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  eResearch  in  the  Humanities  to  advance,  all  the  digital 
information we use – bibliographic references, personal notes,

separate incompatible systems. This does not of course mean 
that  the  system  need  be  monolithic  –  mashups,  portals  and 
Virtual Research Environments all offer distributed alternatives, 
dependant  on  exposure  of  resources  through  feed  and  web 
services. The ‘silo’  approach  to  data  is  also  breaking  down 
with  the  stunning  success  of  web-based  social  software 
such  as  the  Wikipedia  encyclopaedia  or  Del.icio.us  social 
bookmarking systems. These systems demonstrate that – with 
the right level of control and peer review – it is possible to 
build substantial and highly usable databases without the costs 
normally  associated  with  such  resources,  by  harnessing  the 
collaborative enthusiasm of large numbers of people for data 
collection and through data mining of collective behaviour.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Associational  Culture  in  Ireland  (ACI)  project  at  NUI 
Maynooth explores the culture of Irish associational life from 
1750 to 1940, not merely from the point of view of who, what, 
where and when, but also to examine the ‘hidden culture’ of 
social networking that operated behind many clubs and societies 
throughout  the  period.  Recently  commissioned  government 
research on civic engagement and active citizenship in Ireland has 
highlighted the paucity of data available for establishing ‘trends 
in volunteering, civic participation, voting and social contact in 
Ireland’ (Taskforce on Active Citizenship, Background Working 
Paper, 2007, p. 2). The same research has also conﬁ rmed the 
importance in Ireland of informal social networking compared 
to many other economically developed countries (Report of 
the Taskforce on Active Citizenship, 2007). The objective of the 
ACI project is to provide a resource to enable scholars of Irish 
social  and  political  life  to  reconstruct  and  highlight  the  role 
that the wider informal community information ﬁ eld played in 
the public sphere in Ireland from the mid-eighteenth century. 
The project will also provide long-term quantitative digital data 
on  associational  culture  in  Ireland  which  is  compatible  with 
sophisticated statistical analysis, thereby enabling researchers 
to overcome one of the hindrances of modern-day purpose 
based  social  surveys:  the  short  timeframe  of  data  currently 
available.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Associational Culture and Social 
Networking  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>All historians are aware of the importance of social networks 
that underpin the foundations of social and political life in the 
modern world (Clark, 2000; Putnam, 2000). However, given the 
often-transient nature of much of these networks, they can be 
quite difﬁ cult to reconstruct. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One way to examine social networks is to trace them through 
the structures of a developing associational culture where the 
cultivation  of  social  exclusivity  and  overlapping  membership 
patterns provide insights into the wider organisation of civil 
society  at  local,  regional  and  national  levels. To  this  end,  the 
ACI project mines a wide range of historical sources to piece 
together as comprehensive a view as possible of the various 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>voluntary formal associations that existed in Ireland during the 
period c.1750-c.1940. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ﬁ rst  phase  of  the  project  concentrated  on  collecting 
data  on  Irish  associational  culture  and  social  networking 
in  the  period  1750-1820;  the  current  phase  centres  on  the 
period  1820-1880  and  the  third  phase  will  focus  on  the 
years  between  1880  and  1940. The  research  results  so  far 
testify to the vibrancy of associational activity in Ireland and 
already patterns in social networking are becoming apparent 
in  different  parts  of  the  country. The  results  so  far  indicate 
that particular forms of associational culture were popular in 
different parts of the country from the mid-eighteenth century, 
which in turn produced their own particular social networking 
systems. In many respects these patterns were maintained into 
the  nineteenth  century  with  similar  continuities  in  patterns 
of sociability even though these continuities were sometimes 
expressed through different organisations, e.g. the ubiquitous 
Volunteering  movement  of  the  later  eighteenth  century 
gave  way  to  local Yeomanry  units  in  the  beginning  of  the 
nineteenth  century.  Associational  culture  among  the  urban 
middling  strata  also  appeared  to  increase  somewhat  moving 
into the nineteenth century with the increasing appearance of 
charitable and temperance societies in different parts of the 
country. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Software Development  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Given  the  vast  range  of  data  available  in  the  sources  and 
the  multiplicity  of  question  types  posed  by  the  ﬁ ndings,  the 
organisation  and  dissemination  of  the  research  was  one  of 
the  main  priorities  for  the  project. The  desire  to  present  a 
quantitative as well as qualitative proﬁ le of Irish associational 
culture,  which  can  be  expanded  upon  by  future  research, 
presented  particular  difﬁ culties  in  terms  of  the  production 
of the project’s ﬁ ndings. A multi-skilled, partnership approach 
was adopted, fusing historical and computer science expertise 
to  digitally  represent  the  data  recovered  from  the  sources 
and expose the resultant social networking patterns through 
the  construction  of  an  appropriate  online  database  for  the 
project.  Encompassing  over  seventy  individual  data  ﬁ elds  for 
each association, the online ACI database is fully searchable by 
organisation and by individual – the later feature in particular 
allowing  social  patterns  behind  Irish  associational  culture  to 
be traced over the course of two centuries. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> Bradley (2005) points out XML is well suited to document 
oriented  project  materials  (such  as  written  text),  whereas 
relational database implementations are better suited to data 
oriented  project  materials.  Furthermore,  he  indicates  that 
projects may often use both, given that textual materials often 
contain data materials that are more suited to relational models. 
He  argues  that  even  if  one  begins  with  a  text,  the  materials 
may  be  data-orientated  and  better  served  by  a  relational 
model  where  certain  characteristics,  for  example,  linkages 
between data objects and powerful querying are more easily 
expressed using SQL (Structured Query Language) than XML

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>searching  facilities,  for  example,  XPATH  or  XQUERY.  It  was 
necessary, for our project to use a relational model to encode 
data  orientated  materials,  even  though  data  were  derived 
from  newspaper  articles  which  are  typically  more  suited  to 
encoding  in  XML.  Our  relational  objects  are  densely  linked, 
and it is often necessary to build SQL queries incorporating 
multiple joins across many database tables. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>LIST THE BODIES (NAME) ( 
WHERE THE GENDER IS “Female” AND  
WHERE THE STATUS IS “Illegal” AND  
WHERE THE FOUNDING DATE  
IS GREATER THAN 1st OF January 1832 
) 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The  database  contains  over  100  individual  database  tables 
related  to  associations,  members,  sources,  relationships, 
associate  members,  locations,  etc. Authenticated  data  entry 
and  access  is  available  using  online  forms. Test,  rollback  and 
moderation facilities are available for different classes of user.  
Research queries may be formulated using a speciﬁ cally designed 
English  language-type  formal  grammar  called  Associational 
Culture  Query  Language  (ACQL),  which  is  parsed  by  the 
software system to extract and present information from the 
database – parsing involves evaluating ACQL and converting it 
into appropriately constructed SQL suitable for querying the 
database.  Users  may  construct ACQL  manually  or  they  may 
use an online query builder (see Figure 1). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The  software  engineering  process  began  with  all  partners 
involved  in  a  collaborative  process  concentrating  on  the 
construction  of  a  Speciﬁ cation  of  Requirements  (SR) 
document  which  essentially  formed  the  contract  between 
the  ACI  historians  and  software  engineers  –  this  key 
document  was  used  to  derive  all  phases  of  the  software 
development  process,  for  example,  System Analysis,  System 
Design Speciﬁ cations, Software Speciﬁ cations, and Testing and 
Maintenance.  These phases were implemented using a rapid 
prototyping model, where successive passes through a design-
development-testing  cycle  provided  new  prototypes  which 
could  be  evaluated  against  the  SR  document.  As  is  typical 
of  such  development  projects,  there  was  some  requirement 
drift, but the rapid prototyping approach ensured insigniﬁ cant 
divergence between prototypes and expectations outlined in 
the SR document. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  In  order  to  produce  the  SR  document,  the ACI  historians 
composed  a  series  of  research  questions,  which  were  used 
to  extract  the  information  categories  necessary  for  the 
construction  of  social  networks.  During  the  collaborative 
process, these research questions and sources were used to 
identify and model the relationships between the associations 
and  individuals  in  the  sources. A  key  requirement  was  that 
ACI historians wanted to be able to answer speciﬁ c research 
questions related to social networking, for example, “Are there 
any  illegal  women’s  associations/clubs  active  in  Ireland  after 
1832?”  It  was  necessary  to  revise  these  research  questions 
during the Analysis phase, however, as it became apparent that 
the historians did not expect a yes/no answer to this question, 
but rather a list of the associations and clubs, if they existed. 
Most  research  questions  went  through  a  revision  process 
where the cardinality or result context was explicit, i.e. “List 
the illegal women’s associations active in Ireland after 1832”. 
This  research  question  could  be  reformulated  in ACQL  as 
follows: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The parsing software then converts this 
ACQL query into the following SQL:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>SELECT BodyName.bodyName  
FROM  Body, BodyGender, 
BodyName, BodyStatus  
WHERE  (Body.idBody = BodyName.
Body_idBody) AND  
  (Body.idBody = BodyGender.
Body_idBody AND 
   BodyGender.gender =’Female’  AND   
 (Body.idBody = BodyStatus.
Body_idBody AND  
  BodyStatus.typeOfStatus =’Illegal’  AND   
  (Body.foundingDate > ‘1832-01-1’) 
 ) 
); 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> This query  is then  executed  by  the  Relational Database  
Management System  (RDBMS) and the results are returned 
to the environment for presentation to the user. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  We  examined  over  one  hundred  questions  of  this  type 
ensuring  that  our  relational  model  provided  appropriate 
answers.  We  developed  ACQL  to  map  research  questions 
into SQL queries, thereby removing the requirement for the 
user to have knowledge of the database, table joins, or even 
SQL. Researchers need not have an intimate knowledge of the 
relationship between the database tables and their associated 
ﬁ elds to perform searches. Another advantage of this approach 
is that the underlying database structure could change and the 
users would not have to change the format of their queries 
implemented in ACQL.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Ongoing and Future Developments  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  success  of  this  project  depends  on  the  research 
community  using  and  contributing  to  the 
information 
contained in the online database. We are heartened, however, 
by  the  reports  of   Warwick  et  al  (2007)    who  have    shown 
that  when information aggregation  sites  have  user-friendly  
interfaces,  contain  quality  peer-reviewed information, and ﬁ t 
research  needs,  the  research  community  scholars  are  more 
likely  adopt  the  digital  resource. We  believe  that ACQL  is  a 
crucial component in making this system usable by professional 
historians interested in social networking. In particular, as the 
volume of data within the database expands in digital format, 
the potential for developing further social analysis tools such 
as  sociograms  will  be  initiated. All  in  all,  the ACI  database, 
by  providing  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  on  speciﬁ c

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  foundations  of  the  linguistics  of  speech  (i.e.,  language 
in  use,  what  people  actually  say  and  write  to  and  for  each 
other),  as  distinguished  from  ?the  linguistics  of  linguistic 
structure?  that  characterizes  many  modern  academic  ideas 
about language, are 1) the continuum of linguistic behavior, 2) 
extensive (really massive) variation in all features at all times, 3) 
importance of regional/social proximity to “shared” linguistic 
production,  and  4)  differential  frequency  as  a  key  factor  in 
linguistic  production  both  in  regional/social  groups  and  in 
collocations  in  text  corpora  (all  points  easily  and  regularly 
established  with  empirical  study  using  surveys  and  corpora, 
as shown in Kretzschmar Forthcoming a). Taken together, the 
basic elements of speech correspond to what has been called a 
?complex system? in sciences ranging from physics to ecology 
to economics. Order emerges from such systems by means of 
self-organization, but the order that arises from speech is not 
the same as what linguists study under the rubric of linguistic 
structure. This paper will explore the relationship between the 
results of computational analysis of language data with neural 
network  algorithms,  traditionally  accepted  dialect  areas  and 
groupings, and order as it emerges from speech interactions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  both  texts  and  regional/social  groups,  the  frequency 
distribution of features (language variants per se or in proximal 
combinations such as collocations, colligations) occurs as the 
same  curve:  a  ?power  law?  or  asymptotic  hyperbolic  curve 
(in  my  publications,  aka  the  ?A-curve?).  Speakers  perceive 
what is “normal” or “different” for regional/social groups and 
for  text  types  according  to  the A-curve:  the  most  frequent 
variants are perceived as “normal,” less frequent variants are 
perceived as “different,” and since particular variants are more 
or less frequent among different groups of people or types of 
discourse, the variants come to mark identity of the groups 
or  types  by  means  of  these  perceptions.  Particular  variants 
also become more or less frequent in historical terms, which 
accounts for what we call “linguistic change,” although of course 
any such “changes” are dependent on the populations or text 
types observed over time (Kretzschmar and Tamasi 2003). In 
both  synchronic  and  diachronic  study  the  notion  of “scale” 
(how big are the groups we observe, from local to regional/
social  to  national)  is  necessary  to  manage  our  observations 
of  frequency  distributions.  Finally,  our  perceptions  of  the 
whole range of “normal” variants (at any level of scale) create 
“observational artifacts.” That is, the notion of the existence 
of any language or dialect is actually an “observational artifact” 
that comes from our perceptions of the available variants (plus 
other information and attitudes), at one point in time and for 
a  particular  group  of  speakers,  as  mediated  by  the A-curve.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>but instead lack of control over the scale of analysis, and of 
the  non-linear  distribution  of  the  variants  included  in  the 
analysis, that tends to cause the problems we observe. In the 
end, we still cannot validate traditional dialect areas from the 
data (because these areas were also derived without sufﬁ cient 
control over the dynamics of the speech model), but we can 
begin  to  understand  more  clearly  how  the  results  of  neural 
network analysis do reveal important information about the 
distribution of the data submitted to them.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The notion “Standard,” as distinct from “normal,” represents 
institutional agreement about which variants to prefer, some 
less frequent than the “normal” variants for many groups of 
speakers, and this creates the appearance of parallel systems 
for “normal” and “Standard.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  best  contemporary  model  that  accommodates  such 
processing is connectionism, parallel processing according to 
what  anthropologists  call “schemas”  (i.e.,  George  Mandler’s 
notion of schemas as a processing mechanism, D’Andrade 1995: 
122-126, 144-145). Schemas are not composed of a particular 
set of characteristics to be recognized (an object), but instead 
of an array of slots for characteristics out of which a pattern is 
generated, and so schemas must include a process for deciding 
what to construct. One description of such a process is the 
serial  symbolic  processing  model  (D’Andrade  1995:  136-
138), in which a set of logical rules is applied in sequence to 
information available from the outside world in order to select 
a pattern. A reﬁ nement of this model is the parallel distributed 
processing network, also called the connectionist network, or 
neural net (D’Andrade 1995: 138-141), which allows parallel 
operation  by  a  larger  set  of  logical  rules. The  logical  rules 
are  Boolean  operators,  whose  operations  can  be  observed, 
for  example,  in  simulations  that  Kauffman  (1996)  has  built 
based on networks of lightbulbs. Given a very large network 
of  neurons  that  either  ﬁ re  or  not,  depending  upon  external 
stimuli of different kinds, binary Boolean logic is appropriate 
to model “decisions” in the brain which arise from the on/off 
ﬁ ring patterns. Kauffman’s simulations were created to model 
chemical  and  biological  reactions  which  are  similarly  binary, 
either happening or not happening given their state (or pattern) 
of  activation,  as  the  system  cycles  through  its  possibilities. 
The comparison yields similar results: as D’Andrade reports 
(1995: 139-140), serial processing can be “’brittle’--if the input 
is altered very slightly or the task is changed somewhat, the 
whole program is likely to crash” (or as Kauffman might say, 
likely to enter a chaotic state cycle), while parallel processing 
appears to be much more ﬂ exible given mixed or incomplete 
input or a disturbance to the system (or as Kauffman might 
say, it can achieve homeostatic order).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Computational modeling of neural networks appears, then, to be 
an excellent match for analysis of language data. Unfortunately, 
results  to  date  have  often  been  disappointing  when  applied 
to  geographic  language  variation  (Nerbonne  and  Heeringa 
2001, Kretzschmar 2006). Neural network analysis cannot be 
shown reliably to replicate traditional dialect patterns. Instead, 
self-organizational  patterns  yielded  by  neural  net  algorithms 
appear to respond only in a general way to assumed dialect 
areas, and often appear to be derived not from the data but 
from conditions of its acquisition such as “ﬁ eld worker” effects 
(Kretzschmar Forthcoming b). However, this paper will show, 
using  results  from  experiments  with  an  implementation  of 
a  Self-Organizing  Map  (SOM)  algorithm  (Thill,  Kretzschmar, 
Casas, and Yao Forthcoming), that application of the model from 
the linguistics of speech to computer neural network analysis 
of  geographical  language  data  can  explain  such  anomalies.  It 
is not the implementation of neural nets that is the problem,

Blake),  continued  and  augmented  since,  this  paper  discusses 
the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate 
students to using a set of online reading tools.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Expert  readers  were  asked  about  the  value  of  using  online 
tools that allowed them to check, readily, related studies that 
were not cited in the article; to examine work that has followed 
on  the  study  reported  in  the  article;  to  consider  additional 
work that has been done by the same author; and to consult 
additional  sources  on  the  topic  outside  of  the  academic 
literature.  In  the  course  of  this  study,  these  domain-expert 
readers made it clear that reading tools could make a deﬁ nite, 
if limited, contribution to their critical engagement with journal 
articles (especially if certain improvements were made). Their 
reactions also point to an existing set of sophisticated reading 
strategies common to most expert readers.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our  ﬁ ndings  indicate  that  online  tools  are  of  most  value  to 
expert readers when they complement and augment readers’ 
existing  strategies.  We  have  organized  the  results  of  the 
study  around  a  number  of  themes  that  emerged  during  our 
interviews with domain expert readers as these themes speak 
to both readers’ existing reading processes and the potential 
value of the online reading tools. By entering user responses 
into a matrix, we have been able to measure user responses 
and  track  both  negative  and  positive  reactions  to  different 
aspects of the online reading tools.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  addition  to  these  ﬁ ndings,  we  also  discovered  that  users’ 
experiences with the online reading tools was inﬂ uenced by 
their  existing  research  methods,  their  familiarity  with  online 
research,  and  their  expectations  of  online  publishing. While 
many  respondents  felt  that  the  “information  environment” 
created by the online tools was beneﬁ cial to their evaluation 
and understanding of the material, they also expressed some 
dissatisfaction with their experience. Some users questioned 
the  relevance  and  usefulness  of  the  contextual  material 
retrieved by the online tools. Users were also concerned with 
the perceived credibility of research published online and the 
limited amount of freely available online material.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The results of our study reveal both the potential strengths 
and  perceived  weaknesses  of  online  reading  environments. 
Understanding how users read and evaluate research materials, 
anticipating  users’  expectations  of  the  reading  tools  and 
resources, and addressing user concerns about the availability 
of online material will lead to improvements in the design and 
features of online publishing.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  style  in  which  a  text  is  written  reﬂ ects  an  array  of 
meta-information  concerning  the  text  (e.g.,  topic,  register, 
genre)  and  its  author  (e.g.,  gender,  region,  age,  personality). 
The  ﬁ eld  of  stylometry  addresses  these  aspects  of  style. A 
successful  methodology,  borrowed  from  text  categorisation 
research,  takes  a  two-stage  approach  which  (i)  achieves 
automatic selection of features with high predictive value for 
the  categories  to  be  learned,  and  (ii)  uses  machine  learning 
algorithms to learn to categorize new documents by using the 
selected features (Sebastiani, 2002). To allow the selection of 
linguistic features rather than (n-grams of) terms, robust and 
accurate text analysis tools are necessary. Recently, language 
technology has progressed to a state of the art in which the 
systematic study of the variation of these linguistic properties 
in texts by different authors, time periods, regiolects, genres, 
registers, or even genders has become feasible.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  paper  addresses  a  not  yet  very  well  researched 
aspect  of  style,  the  author’s  personality.  Our  aim  is  to  test 
whether  personality  traits  are  reﬂ ected  in  writing  style. 
Descriptive  statistics  studies  in  language  psychology  show  a 
direct  correlation:  personality  is  projected  linguistically  and 
can  be  perceived  through  language  (e.g.,  Gill,  2003;  Gill  & 
Oberlander,  2002;  Campbell  &  Pennebaker,  2003). The  focus 
is on extraversion and neuroticism, two of “the most salient 
and  visible  personality  traits”  (Gill,  2003,  p.  13).  Research  in 
personality  prediction  (e.g.,  Argamon  et  al.,  2005;  Nowson 
&  Oberlander,  2007;  Mairesse  et  al.,  2007)  focuses  on 
openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and 
neuroticism.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  want  to  test  whether  we  can  automatically  predict 
personality  in  text  by  studying  the  four  components  of 
the  Myers-Briggs  Type  Indicator:  Introverted-Extraverted, 
Intuitive-Sensing, Thinking-Feeling,  and  Judging-Perceiving. We 
introduce a new corpus, the Personae corpus, which consists of 
Dutch written language, while other studies focus on English. 
Nevertheless, we believe our techniques to be transferable to 
other languages.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Related Research in Personality 
Prediction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Most  of  the  research  in  personality  prediction  involves  the 
Five-Factor Model of Personality: openness, conscientiousness, 
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The so-called Big 
Five have been criticized for their limited scope, methodology 
and the absence of an underlying theory. Argamon et al. (2005) 
predict  personality  in  student  essays  using  functional  lexical 
features. These features represent lexical and structural choices 
made  in  the  text.  Nowson  &  Oberlander  (2007)  perform 
feature  selection  and  training  on  a  small  and  clean  weblog 
corpus,  and  test  on  a  large,  automatically  selected  corpus. 
Features include n-grams of words with predictive strength for 
the binary classiﬁ cation tasks. Openness is excluded from the 
experiments because of the skewed class distribution. While 
the two studies mentioned above took a bottom-up approach, 
Mairesse  et  al.  (2007)  approach  personality  prediction  from 
a top-down perspective. On a written text corpus, they test 
the  predictive  strength  of  linguistic  features  that  have  been 
proposed in descriptive statistics studies.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Corpus Construction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our 200,000-word Personae corpus consists of 145 BA student 
essays of about 1,400 words about a documentary on Artiﬁ cial 
Life in order to keep genre, register, topic and age relatively 
constant. These  essays  contain  a  factual  description  of  the 
documentary and the students’ opinion about it. The task was 
voluntary  and  students  producing  an  essay  were  rewarded 
with two cinema tickets. They took an online MBTI test and 
submitted their proﬁ le, the text and some user information. All 
students released the copyright of their text to the University 
of Antwerp  and  explicitly  allowed  the  use  of  their  text  and 
personality  proﬁ le  for  research,  which  makes  it  possible  to 
distribute the corpus.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Myers & Myers, 1980) is a 
forced-choice test based on Jung’s personality typology which 
categorizes a person on four preferences:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Introversion and Extraversion (attitudes): I’s tend to 
reﬂ ect before they act, while E’s act before they reﬂ ect.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• iNtuition and Sensing (information-gathering): N’s rely 
on abstract or theoretical information, while S’s trust 
information that is concrete.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Feeling and Thinking (decision-making): While F’s decide 
based on emotions, T’s involve logic and reason in their 
decisions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Judging and Perceiving (lifestyle): J’s prefer structure in 
their lives, while P’s like change.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>MBTI  correlates  with  the  Big  Five  personality  traits 
of  extraversion  and  openness,  to  a  lesser  extent  with 
agreeableness  and  consciousness,  but  not  with  neuroticism 
(McCrae & Costa, 1989).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  participants’  characteristics  are  too  homogeneous  for 
experiments concerning gender, mother tongue or region, but 
we  ﬁ nd  interesting  distributions  in  at  least  two  of  the  four 
MBTI preferences: .45 I vs. .55 E, .54 N vs. .46 S, .72 F vs. .28 F, 
and .81 J and .19 P.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Personality  measurement  in  general,  and  the  MBTI  is  no 
exception, is a controversial domain. However, especially for 
scores  on  IE  and  NS  dimensions,  consensus  is  that  they  are 
correlated  with  personality  traits.  In  the  remainder  of  this 
paper, we will provide results on the prediction of personality 
types from features extracted from the linguistically analyzed 
essays.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Feature Extraction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While  most  stylometric  studies  are  based  on  token-level 
features (e.g., word length), word forms and their frequencies 
of occurrence, syntactic features have been proposed as more 
reliable style markers since they are not under the conscious 
control of the author (Stamatatos et al., 2001).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We use Memory-Based Shallow Parsing (MBSP) (Daelemans et 
al., 1999), which gives an incomplete parse of the input text, to 
extract reliable syntactic features. MBSP tokenizes, performs 
a part-of-speech analysis, looks for chunks (e.g., noun phrase) 
and  detects  subject  and  object  of  the  sentence  and  some 
other grammatical relations.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Features occurring more often than expected (based on the 
chi-square metric) in either of the two classes are extracted 
automatically  for  every  document.  Lexical  features  (lex)  are 
represented  binary  or  numerically,  in  n-grams.  N-grams  of 
both  ﬁ ne-grained  (pos)  and  coarse-grained  parts-of-speech 
(cgp) are integrated in the feature vectors. These features have 
been proven useful in stylometry (cf. Stamatatos et al., 2001) 
and are now tested for personality prediction.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Experiments in Personality Prediction 
and Discussion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We report on experiments on eight binary classiﬁ cation tasks 
(e.g., I vs. not-I) (cf. Table 1) and four tasks in which the goal is 
to distinguish between the two poles in the preferences (e.g., I 
vs. E) (cf. Table 2). Results are based on ten-fold cross-validation 
experiments with TiMBL (Daelemans & van den Bosch, 2005), 
an  implementation  of  memory-based  learning  (MBL).  MBL 
stores feature representations of training instances in memory 
without abstraction and classiﬁ es new instances by matching 
their  feature  representation  to  all  instances  in  memory. We 
also report random and majority baseline results. Per training

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For the I-E task - correlated to extraversion in the Big Five - we 
achieve an accuracy of 65.5%, which is better than Argamon 
et al. (2005) (57%), Nowson & Oberlander (2007) (51%), and 
Mairesse et al. (2007) (55%). For the N-S task - correlated to 
openness - we achieve the same result as Mairesse et al. (2007) 
(62%).  For  the  F-T  and  J-P  tasks,  the  results  hardly  achieve 
higher  than  majority  baseline,  but  nevertheless  something  is 
learned for the minority class, which indicates that the features 
selected  work  for  personality  prediction,  even  with  heavily 
skewed class distributions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusions and Future Work
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Experiments with TiMBL suggest that the ﬁ rst two personality 
dimensions  (Introverted-Extraverted  and  iNtuitive-Sensing) 
can  be  predicted  fairly  accurately.  We  also  achieve  good 
results in six of the eight binary classiﬁ cation tasks. Thanks to 
improvements  in  shallow  text  analysis,  we  can  use  syntactic 
features for the prediction of personality type and author.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Further  research  using  the  Personae  corpus  will  involve  a 
study of stylistic variation between the 145 authors. A lot of 
the research in author recognition is performed on a closed-
class task, which is an artiﬁ cial situation. Hardly any corpora 
–  except  for  some  based  on  blogs  (Koppel  et  al.,  2006) 
–  have  more  than  ten  candidate  authors. The  corpus  allows 
the  computation  of  the  degree  of  variability  encountered  in 
text  on  a  single  topic  of  different  (types)  of  features  when 
taking into account a relatively large set of authors. This will 
be a useful complementary resource in a ﬁ eld dominated by 
studies  potentially  overestimating  the  importance  of  these 
features in experiments discriminating between only two or a 
small number of authors.

personality  prediction. Argamon  et  al.  (2005)  ﬁ nd  appraisal 
adjectives and modiﬁ ers to be reliable markers (58% accuracy) 
of neuroticism, while extraversion can be predicted by function 
words  with  57%  accuracy.  Nowson  &  Oberlander  (2007) 
predict  high/low  extraversion  with  a  50.6%  accuracy,  while 
the system achieves 55.8% accuracy on neuroticism, 52.9% on 
agreeableness,  and  56.6%  on  conscientiousness.  Openness  is 
excluded  because  of  the  skewed  class  distribution. Taking  a 
top-down approach, Mairesse et al. (2007) report accuracies 
of  55.0%  for  extraversion,  55.3%  for  conscientiousness, 
55.8%  agreeableness,  57.4%  for  neuroticism,  and  62.1%  for 
openness.

at King’s College London has focussed on the role and place 
of the digital humanities in the academic curriculum of Higher 
Education  (see  Jessop:2005,  Jessop:forthcoming). This  work 
is  based  on  the  experience  of  both  our  undergraduate  and 
postgraduate programmes focusing particularly on the way in 
which  students  are  encouraged  to  integrate  the  content  of 
a  variety  of  digital  humanities  courses  and  apply  it  to  their 
own research project. In the case of the undergraduates this is 
developed in conjunction with their home department. These 
courses are designed to train not just the new generation of 
young scholars in our discipline but also the majority who will 
gain  employment  in  a  variety  of  professions  in  industry  and 
commerce.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our students come from a range of disciplines and backgrounds 
within the humanities and what is highlighted in each case is 
the necessity to ensure that their projects meet the scholarly 
criteria  of  their  home  disciplines  and  the  interdisciplinary 
aspects of humanities computing. This emphasises the need for 
training  the  students  in  collaborative  method  and  reﬂ ective 
practice; the need to build a community of learning which will 
lead to a community of practice. This paper discusses recent 
research and initiatives within distance learning, focussing on 
how these can be repurposed for campus-based courses, and 
is illustrated by the ﬁ ndings of their use in a digital humanities 
course.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There  have  been  a  number  of  initiatives  that  are  pertinent 
to  this  topic. The  published  report  on  the  accomplishments 
of the Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities convened 
in 2005 at the University of Virginia (http://www.iath.virginia.
edu/dtsummit/ ) identiﬁ ed areas where innovative change was 
taking place that could lead to what they referred to as “a new 
stage  in  humanistic  scholarship”. The  style  of  collaboration 
enabled by digital learning community tools is identiﬁ ed as one 
such  area. This  has  been  further  reinforced  at  the  National 
Endowment  of  the  Humanities  hosted  Summit  Meeting  of 
Digital Humanities Centers and Funders held in April 2007 at 
the University of Maryland.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On  the  summit  wiki  among  the  areas  of  research  priorities 
and funder priorities John Unsworth lists: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Collaborative work
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Teaching and learning 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Collaboration among scholars
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(https://apps.lis.uiuc.edu/wiki/display/DHC/Areas+of+researc
h+priorities%2C+funder+priorities ) 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Building  communities  of  learning  and  developing  strategies 
for collaborative working has been the subject of much study 
within  the  distance  learning  community  (Anderson:2004, 
Brown:2006,  Perry  and  Edwards:2005,  Swan:2002,  et  al)  and 
here  it  is  argued  that  this  also  needs  to  be  a  consideration 
for  campus-based  academic  programmes. The  growing  trend 
among undergraduate programmes of a movement away from 
set courses to the introduction of modular and credit systems 
means that students no longer follow a single programme of 
study. Their time is fragmented between their chosen course 
options and they often only come together with their peers 
for ‘core  courses’. Thus  in  the  last  two  decades  study  has 
become more of an individual rather than community-based 
activity. This trend needs to be compensated for by teaching 
collaborative skills, the very same skills that are at the heart of 
the majority of digital humanities research projects.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ‘Community  of  Inquiry’  model  (developed  by  Garrison, 
Anderson  and Archer:2000  and  2004)  draws  out  the  basic 
elements  which  overlap  to  form  the  educational  experience 
of  the  distance  learner:  social,  cognitive,  and  teaching 
presence. This model is used as a framework to analyse the 
effectiveness  of  asynchronous  discussion  methodologies 
(which  encourage  reﬂ ective  practice),  with  particular  regard 
for  cognitive  presence  (where  students  construct  meaning 
through communication with their peers, which is particularly 
important in the development of critical thinking), when used 
in campus-based courses.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Building Networked Communities for 
Collaborative and Reﬂ ective Teaching 
and Learning  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The highly collaborative nature of modern research practice 
makes it clear that future humanities scholars need to be trained 
in the collaborative process and to understand the importance 
of  critical  reﬂ ection  (Jessop:2005,  Jessop:forthcoming).  This 
emphasis  on  collaborative  practice  represents  a  shift  in  the 
academic culture of humanities away from the popular funding 
model  of  a  single  researcher  towards  one  of  team  working 
where no single person has complete control or ownership. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This is closer to models in operation in the sciences where 
progress is often based on team efforts and reports frequently 
have  many  authors;  we  may  need  to  develop  protocols  that 
borrow some aspects of science research practice. The results 
of the author’s limited research into the effectiveness of the 
collaborative process in medical research practice are also to 
be included in this study.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  develop  an  environment  that  fosters  collaboration  and 
reﬂ ection students should be actively encouraged to engage 
with  each  other  both  inside  and  outside  of  the  classroom. 
With  social  software  (MySpace,  Facebook,  LiveJournal,  inter 
alia)  students  are  already  building  networked  communities, 
and  the  blog  and  wiki  have  provided  educators  with  simple, 
readily available tools to build learning communities. The wiki 
can  be  deployed  as  an  experiential  and  formative  learning 
environment  outside  of  the  classroom  with  students  able 
to  create  their  own  content,  comment  on  each  others,  and 
share resources using tools like del.icio.us and MyIntute. The 
blog  supports  this  with  a  less  formal  reﬂ ective  space  which 
belongs to the students themselves rather than their course. 
The  asynchronous  nature  of  these  media  gives  students  the 
opportunity to reﬂ ect on their classmates’ contribution in the 
processes of creating their own (Swan:2000) and so instil the 
practice of critical reﬂ ection. Further, with simple applications 
such  as  MyYahoo  and  iGoogle  students  can  draw  all  their 
varied networks together along with course and departmental 
webpages thus giving a single interface or ‘Personal Learning 
Portal’ (PLP) through which to access and manage their online 
resources.    
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  their  PLP  students  create  a  web  interface  for  their  own 
digital environment that includes: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Content management where they integrate both personal 
and academic interests 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• A networking system for connection with others 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Collaborative and individual workspace 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Communications setup 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• A series of syndicated and distributed feeds 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This model is based on a presentation given by Terry Anderson 
at the Centre for Distance Education, University of London in 
March 2007:  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>http://www.cde.london.ac.uk/support/news/generic3307.
htm).  In  this Anderson  discusses  how  the  Personal  Learning 
Environment  (PLE),  such  as  that  used  at  Athabasca,  is  an 
improvement  on  the  popular Virtual  Learning  Environment 
(VLE). That argument is developed here with stress upon the 
further advantages of the PLP introduced earlier.   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>What  is  notable  is  that  this  model  represents  an  approach 
rather  than  a  speciﬁ c  application  and  is  portable  and  not 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>dependant  on  a  single  department  or  even  institution. This 
ensures sustainability as it allows and encourages students to 
take the tools and skills from one area and apply them in others 
(arguably  the  basis  of  humanities  computing,  see  McCarty 
and  Short:2002). At  the  same  time  it  puts  the  emphasis  for 
the  responsibility  for  managing  their  own  learning  and  web 
resources on the students. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  approach  learners  are  encouraged  to  interact  and 
collaborate in a way that does not occur when static webpages 
are viewed with a traditional browser. The pages on a wiki and 
the  student’s  PLP  are  dynamic  and  mutable  as  they  can  be 
edited by the user through their web browser. Learners gain 
the ability to enrich the material and, unlike a print publication 
where  those  annotations  are  only  for  personal  use,  make 
these available for others. Such exchanges of ideas are central 
to the processes of building communities of learning and it is 
in this way that knowledge grows as we are able to push the 
boundaries of scholarship. The model that is developing here is 
one in which the student moves from being a reader of other 
peoples’  material  to  active  engagement  with  that  material;  a 
transition from being a ‘reader’ to being an ‘interpreter’.   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Education  is  an  academic,  individual,  and  a  social  experience 
that  requires  a  sustainable  community  of  learning. The  tools 
and experiences developed in the distance learning ﬁ eld can 
be  re-purposed  for  the  ‘analogue’  students.  The  suggested 
model based on the student’s PLP is grounded in collaborative 
practice,  uses  asynchronous  discussion  to  develop  reﬂ ective 
practice  and  ensure  cognitive  presence;  it  is  sustainable  and 
portable.    Putting  this  in  the  wider  context,  it  is  by  building 
a  community  of  learners  that  we  will  instil  the  cooperative, 
collaborative, and reﬂ ective skills needed for a community of 
humanities scholars; skills that are equally in demand outside 
of the academy. The tools have already been subject to limited 
trials in the digital humanities programmes at King’s College 
London but the current academic year will see a more extensive 
application of them across our teaching. The ﬁ nal version this 
paper  will  report  on  the  results  of  the  experiences  of  both 
teachers  and  learners  of  this  model  applied  to  a  humanities 
computing course. The work contributes to the pedagogy of 
the  digital  humanities  in  the  academic  curricula  both  within 
the  teaching  of  humanities  computing  and  the  development 
of  tools  for  collaborative  research  and  on-line  learning 
communities.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Middle English Grammar 
Corpus - a tool for studying 
the writing and speech 
systems of medieval English

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Middle English Grammar Project
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Middle  English  Grammar  Project  (MEG),  shared  by  the 
Universities  of  Glasgow  and  Stavanger,  is  working  towards 
the  description  of  Middle  English  orthography,  morphology 
and phonology. MEG is among the ﬁ rst attempts to span the 
gap between Jordan’s Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik: 
Lautlehre (1925) and now. Our aim is to combine the advances 
in  Middle  English  dialectology  in  the  latter  half  of  the  20th 
century  and  the  computing  power  currently  available  in  the 
service of writing an up-to-date grammar of Middle English.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Middle English dialects and 
dialectology
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  study  of  Middle  English  dialects  took  a  giant  leap 
forward by Angus McIntosh’s insight that Middle English texts 
represent distinct regional varieties in their spelling systems, 
and  therefore  the  spelling  variants  of  these  texts  could  be 
studied  in  their  own  right  and  not  merely  as  reﬂ ections  of 
the  then  speech  systems,  i.e.  dialects  (McIntosh  1963). This 
multitude  of  regional  spellings  arose  when  English  had  been 
replaced  by  French  and  Latin  in  all  important  aspects  for 
nearly  two  centuries  after  the  Norman  Conquest:  the  re-
introduction  of  English  into  literary  and  utilitarian  registers 
from the thirteenth century onwards was not governed by any 
nationwide standard and thus English was written according 
to each scribe’s perception of the ‘correct’ spelling. McIntosh’s 
vision led to a project that grew into A Linguistic Atlas of Late 
Mediaeval English (LALME; 1986).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Aims of MEG
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Middle English Grammar project builds on the work of 
the LALME team and aims at producing a description of Middle 
English orthography, phonology and morphology, from 1100 to 
1500. Here we use the term grammar in a wide, philological 
sense.  Eventually,  the  grammar  is  meant  as  an  replacement 
to  Richard  Jordan’s  Handbuch  der  mittelenglischen  Grammatik: 
Lautlehre, and to provide a reference point for the students and 
scholars of Middle English in the form of a broad description 
of  the  Middle  English  usages  accompanied  by  more  speciﬁ c 
county  studies,  and  eventually  also  all  the  base  material  we 
accumulate for this task (Black, Horobin, and Smith 2002: 13).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Middle English Grammar: How?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ﬁ rst task of MEG is to compile a corpus of Middle English 
texts  localized  in  LALME. The  corpus  is  called  The  Middle 
English  Grammar  Corpus,  or  MEG-C  (the  ﬁ rst  installment 
forthcoming 2007). Secondly, the corpus texts need appropriate 
lemmatization  and  annotation  in  order  to  be  usable  in  the 
course of MEG.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Linguistic data is collected by transcribing extracts from either 
the  original  manuscripts,  or  good-quality  microﬁ lms.  The 
prioritised material are the texts that were localized in LALME, 
although later texts that were not analysed for LALME will be 
taken  into  account  as  well.  LALME  covers  years  1350-1450 
(-1500);  the  material  for  the  studies  in  1100-1350  will  be 
drawn from A Linguistic Atlas for Early Middle English (LAEME) 
(Laing and Lass, forthcoming 2007).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The manuscript texts are represented by 3,000-word extracts 
(or in toto, if shorter), which should be sufﬁ ciently for studies 
on  orthography,  phonology  and  morphology.  The  planned 
corpus will sample c. 1,000 texts, therefore the projected size 
of the corpus is 2.5-3 M words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  conventions  of  transcription  have  been  derived  from 
those of the LAEME and A Linguistic Atlas of Older Scots projects 
(LAOS),  with  certain  modiﬁ cations.  The  most  important 
questions that have been addressed during the transcription 
process  have  been  whether  to  emphasise  ﬁ delity  to  the 
original vs. wieldy transcripts, and should the transcripts offer 
an interpretative reading of the manuscript text rather than 
the  scribe’s  actual  pen  strokes. According  to  the  principles 
chosen, the transcriptions attempt to capture the graphemic 
and broad graphetic details, but not necessarily each detail on 
the level of individual handwriting (Black, Horobin, and Smith 
2002: 11).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>MEG-C: lemmatization, annotation, 
publication
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The second practical task is to lemmatize and to annotate the 
Corpus.  Previous  historical  English  corpora  (Helsinki  Corpus, 
Middle English Medical Texts) show the limitations the lack of 
lemmas  set  to  the  corpus  user  when  tackling  the  variety  of 
spellings  attested  to  by  Middle  English  texts. The  lemmas  in 
MEG-C will have an Oxford English Dictionary headword. There 
will  also  be  another  cue  in  the  source  language  (the  direct 
source  languge  before  Middle  English,  usually  Old  English, 
French/Anglo-Norman or Latin). These two reference points 
on either side of Middle English will provide the user the means 
to search for occurrences of a lexical item even when the full 
range of spelling variation in Middle English is not known.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>into  a  word  initial  sequence  containing  Onset  and  Nucleus, 
and they are followed by a series of Consonantal and Vowel 
Spelling Units. Each spelling unit is also given the equivalents in 
the source language and in Present Day English, thus enabling 
the  search  for  e.g.  all  the  ME  reﬂ exes  of  OE  [a:]  or  or  the 
spelling variants in Middle English that correspond to Present 
Day English word initial spelling sh-.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  the  task  of  annotation  and  lemmatization  the  corpus  is 
rendered  into  a  relational  database. The  database  plan  has 
tables for different extralinguistic information, and the actual 
texts will be entered word by word, i.e. in the table for corpus 
texts, there will be one record for each word. The annotation 
plan we are intending to carry out should result in a corpus 
where one can search for any combination of extralinguistic 
factors and spelling units with reference points embedded in 
the actual Middle English texts and also in the source language 
and PDE spelling conventions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ﬁ rst  installment  of  MEG-C  will  be  published  in  2007, 
containing  roughly  30  per  cent  of  the  texts  in  the  planned 
corpus in ASCII format. It will be on the Internet, accessible 
for  anyone  to  use  and  download.  Our  aim  with  publication 
is two-fold: ﬁ rstly, we will welcome feedback of any kind, and 
especially from scholars who know the texts well; secondly, we 
want to encourage and to see other scholars use the corpus.

be a usable game for the humanities. In this paper, we discuss 
research issues related to the design of “usable” humanities-
based video games and situate those research questions along 
ﬁ ve interrelated dimensions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  ﬁ rst  provide  our  deﬁ nition  of  usability  as  used  in  this 
context. A  usable  humanities  game  is  a  game  which  is  both 
functionally  capable  in  terms  of  an  interface  and  its  human 
interactions as well as appropriately designed to support the 
types of learning objectives attached to its scenarios or levels. 
This deﬁ nition is formed from the convergence of traditional 
interface usability and learning effectiveness. We support our 
delineation of research questions using theoretical work from 
scholars  writing  about  gaming  as  well  as  applied  examples 
from  our  own  research  and  game  development  prototypes. 
Drawing  from  three  years  of  experience  building  a  variety 
of  games,  and  literature  culled  from  our  various  ﬁ elds,  we 
discuss some of the unique research questions that designing 
for the humanities pose for scholars and game designers. We 
separate  these  questions  across  ﬁ ve  dimensions,  each  with 
representative humanities learning questions:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. Participation: how can we encourage diverse groups 
of students and researchers to interact together in virtual 
space? How can we design a space that is appealing and 
equitable to both genders and to a diverse range of 
demographic proﬁ les?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. Mechanics: how do you design algorithms that are 
applicable to the types of tasks commonly sought in 
humanities courses? For instance, how might one develop an 
algorithm to “score” morally relative gameplay decisions in 
an ethical dilemma?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. Ontology: how is a player’s self-image challenged when 
shifting from a real to what Gee (2003) calls a projected 
identity, and how is this process changed through the use 
of varying perspectives such as ﬁ rst-person or third-person 
perspective?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. Hermeneutics: how do we probe the hidden layers that 
exist between game worlds, source content, and human 
computer interfaces? What “voices” are encouraged in 
virtual worlds, and what voices are repressed within this 
rhetorical space?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>5. Culture: how are the cultural facets of primary source 
content mediated through the process of digitization?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  consider  these  dimensions,  we  craft  a  theoretical  base 
formed from a wide range of researchers such as Gee (2003), 
Prensky (2001), Squire (2002), and Jenkins (2006a, 2006b). From 
Gee, we draw inspiration from his discussion of well-designed 
games and his exploration of the implicit learning occurring in 
several different genres of digital video games. Much of Gee’s 
work has involved applying insights from the cognitive sciences 
to traditional humanities domains such as literature in order 
to explore identity, problem solving skills, verbal and nonverbal 
learning, and the transfer of learned abilities from one task to 
another.  Marc  Prensky  notes  that  musical  learning  games  in 
the humanities have been used for hundreds of years -- Bach’s 
Well Tempered Clavier and The Art of the Fugue are his “learning 
games,”  simple  to  complex  musical  exercises  that  build  skill. 
Prensky’s  work  also  informs  our  historical  analysis  as  well 
as insights from the pioneers working in the ﬁ eld of serious 
gaming for military applications.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Jenkins’ work in applying the interests of gaming fans as critical 
lenses provides insight for both formative guidelines and post-
task  measures  of “success”  in  learning  game  environments. 
These gaming discourse communities often form wildly active 
and  inﬂ uential  fan  groups,  and  these  groups  cultivate  their 
own forms of expression and understanding through complex 
jargon, virtual initiations, and ritualistic rules and procedures 
in virtual interaction. Gaming environments and virtual worlds 
have  also  been  shown  to  offer  rich  sources  of  material  for 
investigating  notions  of  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  and  cultural 
identity (Berman & Bruckman, 2001; Squire, 2002).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Building on the work of these scholars, others have extended 
these general notions of digital game based learning to account 
for  speciﬁ c  curricula  or  learning  objectives  such  as  media 
project management for humanities computing (McDaniel et 
al., 2006). To build these humanities learning games, we have 
assembled  an  interdisciplinary  team  composed  of  faculty 
members from Digital Media, English, and Philosophy. Individuals 
from this group have worked in a variety of capacities, as script 
writers, artists, programmers, and producers. Undergraduate 
and  graduate  students,  in  both  classroom  and  research  lab 
roles,  have  worked  and  contributed  to  each  of  these  games 
in varying capacities. Five different games have been produced 
through these collaborations:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. Discover Babylon (Lucey-Roper, 2006), a game produced 
by the Federation of American Scientists, the Walters 
Art Museum in Baltimore, and UCLA’s Cuneiform Digital 
Library Initiative (CDLI). One of our team members 
developed the storyline for this game.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. The Carol Mundy Underground Railroad game (Greenwood-
Ericksen et al., 2006) examines issues of African-American 
history and culture and leads a player on an adventure from 
a Southern plantation to safety in the North through the 
Underground Railroad’s system of safehouses. This was a 
“modded” game built atop Neverwinter Nights.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. The Turkey Maiden (Underberg, forthcoming) is an 
educational computer game project based on a version 
of Cinderella collected by folklorist Ralph Steele Boggs 
in 1930s Ybor City, Florida. This variant of the Cinderella 
story, called “The Turkey Maiden” (from Kristin Congdon’s 
anthology Uncle Monday and Other Florida Tales, 2001) forms 
the narrative structure of the game, which has been further 
developed by integrating speciﬁ c tasks that the heroine 
Rosa (“Cinderella”) must successfully complete to advance 
in the game that are based in lessons to be learned by the 
player about Florida history and culture.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. Chaucer’s Medieval Virtual World Video Game is a virtual 
medieval world game based on Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. 
This tale emphasizes the battle between men’s perceived 
authority and women’s struggles for power. This game 
uses Chaucer’s narrative gap as a springboard for a virtual 
medieval quest. In addition to experiencing historical 
scenarios, the knight will disguise his identity and experience 
the world from various gender and social classes, the Three 
Estates of Clergy, Nobility, and Peasantry as well as the 
three feminine estates of virgin, widow, and wife.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>5. The Medium is a prototype ethics game designed using 
the Torque game engine. This three year project was funded 
by the University of Central Florida’s Ofﬁ ce of Information 
Fluency and is in its earliest stages of design. The game pairs 
a time travel theme with a switchable ﬁ rst and third person 
perspective and also includes an environmentalist subtext.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  will  use  brief  examples  culled  from  these  games  to

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>support  our  theoretical  assertions  and  discuss  ways  in 
which usable humanities games can act as a springboard for 
bringing  together  subject  matter  experts,  technologists,  and 
learners.  In  their  2006  report  on  Cyberinfrastructure  for 
the Humanities and Social Sciences, the American Council of 
Learned  Societies  writes  the  following  in  regards  to  digital 
networked technologies for the humanities: “A cyberstructure 
for humanities and social science must encourage interactions 
between the expert and the amateur, the creative artist and 
the  scholar,  the  teacher  and  the  student.  It  is  not  just  the 
collection of data—digital or otherwise—that matters: at least 
as important is the activity that goes on around it, contributes 
to  it,  and  eventually  integrates  with  it”  (14).  Our  goal  is  to 
foster  this  type  of  humanistic,  communicative  environment 
using new technologies for virtual worlds, usability testing, and 
game-based learning environments. We hope that the scholarly 
community  working  the  ﬁ eld  of  digital  humanities  can  help 
us to explore and reﬁ ne both theoretical models and applied 
technologies related to this goal.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Studying  Picasso  as  writer  might  seem  strange,  considering 
that  the  Spanish  artist  is  mostly  known  for  his  paintings. 
However, in the Fall of 2006 we began working on Picasso’s 
writings. Audenaert,  et.al.  [1],  describe  the  characteristics  of 
Picasso’s  manuscripts,  and  the  challenges  they  pose  due  to 
their pictorial and visual aspects. With over 13,000 artworks 
up-to-date catalogued, the On-line Picasso Project [5] includes 
a  historical  narrative  of  relevant  events  in  the  artist’s  life.  In 
this  paper  we  discuss  the  contents  of  the  texts—from  the 
linguistic  standpoint—and  the  implementation  of  a  bilingual 
concordance  of  terms  based  on  a  red-black  tree. Although 
concordances  have  been  widely  studied  and  implemented 
within linguistics and humanities, we believe that our collection 
raises  interesting  challenges;  ﬁ rst  because  of  the  bilingual 
nature  of  Picasso’s  poems,  since  he  wrote  both  in  Spanish 
and French, and second, because of the connection between 
his  texts  and  his  paintings. The  work  reported  in  this  paper 
focuses on the ﬁ rst issue.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Integrating Texts Into the On-line 
Picasso Project
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In the Fall of 2007 Picasso’s texts were added to the collection 
along with their corresponding images, and a concordance of 
terms both in Spanish and French was created. The architecture 
created for Picasso’s poems is partially based on the one we 
developed for the poetry of John Donne [7]. As often happens 
in the humanities, each collection has its own characteristics, 
which makes a particular architecture hard if not impossible 
to  reuse  directly.  For  example,  Donne’s  texts  are  written  in 
English; Picasso in contrast wrote both in Spanish and French.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Concordance of Terms
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  concordance,  according  to  the  Oxford  English  Dictionary, 
is  “an  alphabetical  arrangement  of  the  principal  words 
contained in a book, with citations of the passages in which 
they  occur.”   When  applied  to  a  speciﬁ c  author’s  complete 
works,  concordances  become  useful  tools  since  they  allow 
users to locate particular occurrences of one word, or even 
more interestingly, the frequency of such words in the entire 
oeuvre  of  an  author.  Apparently,  the  ﬁ rst  concordances  in 
English ever put together were done in the thirteenth century, 
and dealt with the words, phrases, and texts in the Bible. Such 
concordances  were  intended  for  the  specialized  scholar  of 
biblical texts and were never a popular form of literature. As 
might be expected, these were soon followed by a Shakespeare 
concordance.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  concordance  of  the  literary  works  of  Pablo  Picasso  has 
more  in  common  with  a  Biblical  concordance  than  with  a 
Shakespearian concordance, due to the manner in which the 
Spanish  artist/poet  composed  his  poems.  Many  critics  have 
pointed  out  the  heightened  quality  of  words  in  Picasso’s 
texts,  a  value  that  surpasses  their  own  sentential  context. 
One gets the impression that words are simply selected for 
their individual attributes and are then thrown together in the 
poems. Picasso himself appears to admit using this technique 
when he is quoted as saying that “words will eventually ﬁ nd 
a way to get along with each other.” For this reason, readers 
of  Picasso’s  poems  become  well  aware  of  the  frequent 
recurrence  of  certain “essential  words,”  which  one  is  then 
eager to locate precisely in each of the poems to determine 
signiﬁ cant nuances.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  catalogue  raisonné  is  a  scholarly,  systematic  list  of  an 
artist’s  known  works,  or  works  previously  catalogued. The 
organization of the catalogues may vary—by time period, by 
medium, or by style—and it is useful to consult any prefatory 
matter to get an idea of the overall structure imposed by the 
cataloguer. Printed catalogues are by necessity constrained to 
the time in which they are published. Thus, quite often catalogue 
raisonnés  are  superseded  by  new  volumes  or  entirely  new 
editions, which may (or may not) correct an earlier publication 
[2].  Pablo  Picasso’s  artistic  creations  have  been  documented 
extensively in numerous catalogs. Chipp and Wofsy [3], started 
publishing a catalogue raisonné of Picasso’s works that contains 
an illustrated synthesis of all catalogues to date on the works 
of Pablo Picasso.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Concordances are often automatically generated from texts, 
and therefore fail to group words by classes (lexical category, 
semantic content, synonymy, metonymy, etc.) The Concordance 
we  are  developing  will  allow  users  to  group  words  in  such 
categories, thus concentrating on the network of interrelations 
between words that go far beyond the speciﬁ c occurrences in 
the poems.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Picasso  is  a  bilingual  poet.  This  raises  several  interesting 
questions  connected  to  what  has  been  pointed  out  above.  
One may wonder, for instance, if Picasso’s thematic domain is 
“language-bound,” in other words, whether he communicates 
certain  concepts  in  one  language  but  not  in  the  other.  A 
Concordance will allow users to set correspondences between 
words  in  one  language  and  another.  Given  Picasso’s  strong 
Spanish  heritage,  it  would  be  expected  that  concrete  ideas 
(dealing  with  food,  customs,  etc)  will  tend  to  be  expressed 
exclusively in Spanish, while those ideas dealing with general 
philosophical  and  religious  problems  will  oscillate  between 
the two languages. The possible corroboration of this point is 
another objective of the planned Concordance.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 2. Concordance with term frequency. 
On the right, term-in-context display.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Red Black Tree Implementation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Term concordances require the extraction of terms from a large 
corpus along with the metadata related to their occurrences, 
an  operation  often  computationally  expensive.  The  Digital 
Donne for instance, is a pre-computed concordance. On the 
other hand, repositories of texts are under constant revision 
as  errors  are  detected  and  corrected. When  the  corpus  is 
modiﬁ ed, part or the entire concordance has to be rebuilt. To 
solve this problem, the Picasso’s concordance is computed on 
the ﬂ y, without requiring any previous processing.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The repository of poems has initially been divided into poems, 
stanza, and lines, then stored in a database. Using standard join 
operations, the poems are reconstructed, allowing the terms 
to be retrieved along additional metadata such as title, section, 
and  line  number.  Once  the  poems  have  been  reconstructed, 
each poem line is broken down into terms, which are deﬁ ned 
as  a  series  of  characters  delimited  by  a  textual  space.  Each 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1. A tabbed interface presents users with 
French and Spanish Texts in chronological order. On 
the right are text and image presentations
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By  narrowing  down  the  number  of  these “essential  words,” 
the  concordance  also  allows  users  to  delimit  the “thematic 
domain” elaborated in Picasso’s writings. Clearly many words 
deal with physical duress and the confrontation between good 
and evil, as manifestations of concrete human suffering during 
the Spanish Civil War and the German occupation of France in 
World War II. By identifying the range of words employed, users 
can  clearly  determine  the  political  and  cultural  environment 
that surrounds Picasso’s artistic creations during this period.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Nevertheless,  one  must  not  forget  that  Picasso’s  main 
contribution  to  the  world  is  that  of  a  plastic  artist.  A 
Concordance  will  allow  users  to  identify  each  of  the  words 
Picasso  used  and  link  them  to  speciﬁ c  graphic  images  in  his 
artworks.  It  has  been  argued  that  Picasso’s  poetry  is  quite 
“physical”  (he  often  refers  to  objects,  their  different  colors, 
textures, etc.). Even in his compositional technique, one gets 
a sense that the way he introduces “physical” words into his 
poems  emulates  the  manner  in  which  he  inserted   “found 
objects” in his cubist collages. Many critics have pointed out, 
on  the  other  hand,  that  Picasso’s  art,  particularly  during  his 
Cubist period, is “linguistic” in nature, exploring the language 
of art, the arbitrariness of pictorial expression, etc.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Mallen  [6]  argues  that  Cubism  explored  a  certain  intuition 
Picasso  had  about  the  creative  nature  of  visual  perception. 
Picasso realized that vision involves arbitrary representation, 
but,  even  more  importantly,  that  painting  also  does.  Once 
understood  as  an  accepted  arbitrary  code,  painting  stopped 
being treated as a transparent medium to become an object 
in its own right. From then on, Picasso focused his attention 
on artistic creation as the creative manipulation of arbitrary 
representations. Viewed in this light, painting is merely another 
language, governed by similar strict universal principles as we 
ﬁ nd in verbal language, and equally open to inﬁ nite possibilities 
of expression. A concordance allows users to see these two 
interrelated aspects of Picasso’s career ﬂ eshed out in itemized 
form.

structure, as well as its occurrence metadata.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>References
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our  algorithm  consists  of  an  augmented  data  structure 
composed  of  a  Red  Black  Tree  [4,8],  where  each  node 
represents one term found in Picasso’s writings and is used as 
pointer to a linked list. A Red Black Tree is a self balanced binary 
tree, that can achieve insert, delete, and search operations in 
O(log  n)  time.  Because  only  insertions  and  random  access 
is  not  required  on  the  linked  list,  term  occurrences  can  be 
traversed  sequentially  in  O(n)  time.  Picasso’s  literary  legacy 
can be browsed and explored using titles as surrogates, which 
are ordered by date and by the term concordance. Each entry 
provides  the  number  of  occurrences  and  its  corresponding 
list, which can be used as index to browse the poems.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  retrieval  process  for  terms  and  their  occurrences  is 
carried  out  by  selecting  speciﬁ c  terms  or  choosing  from  an 
alphabetical  index  of  letters.   To  achieve  this,  a  subtree  is 
extracted from the data structure and it is traversed, obtaining 
every  occurrence  of  a  term  along  with  additional  metadata 
including  a  unique  poem  identiﬁ er,  page  and  line  number. 
Extensible  Stylesheet  Language Transformations  (XSLTs)  are 
used  to  transform  the  resulting  XML  output,  and  extract 
the  speciﬁ c  term  occurrences  within  a  line  of  the  poem 
and  produce  a  surrogate,  which  is  composed  of  a  portion 
of  the  text. Additionally,  this  surrogate  gives  access  to  the 
corresponding poems through hyperlinks.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A new component of our implementation is a Spanish-French 
thesaurus that correlates terms in both languages, along with 
their meanings and commentary. Because our concordance is 
created on the ﬂ y, we have to devise a mechanism to support 
this.  Additionally,  this  approach  still  remains  to  be  tested 
with  different  corpuses  in  other  languages,  especially  where 
terms are separated uniquely and spaces between them play 
a  different  role  in  language  constructs. The  term  extraction 
algorithm  is  efﬁ cient  using  spaces  as  delimiters—a  common 
case  both  in  Spanish  and  French.  However,  other  languages 
might include composite words.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Scholars  and  general  users  of  digital  editions  face  a  difﬁ cult 
and  problematic  scenario  when  browsing  and  searching  for 
resources that are related to time periods or events. Scrolling 
continuously  through  a  long  list  of  itemized  search  results 
does  not  constitute  an  unusual  practice  for  users  when 
dealing  with  this  type  of  situation.  The  problem  with  this 
searching  mechanism  is  that  a  notion  of  the  corresponding 
dates or keywords associated with the event are required and 
constitute a precondition to a successful search.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>An ordered list is unable to provide the required affordances 
and constraints that users need and desire to conduct scholarly 
research  properly.  It  is  a  common  practice  among  users  to 
utilize the search mechanism present in most web browsers, 
and then perform another search among the obtained results 
to “narrow  down”  or  limit  the  results  to  a  smaller  working 
set  that  is  easier  to  manage. The  use  of  an  external  search 
mechanism in a digital edition is a strong indicator that improved 
interfaces must be designed, conceived and implemented, just 
to achieve the sole purpose of facilitating scholarly research.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Background
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Online  Picasso  Project  (OPP)  is  a  digital  collection  and 
repository maintained by the Center for the Study of Digital 
Libraries at Texas A&M University, and the Foreign Languages 
Department at Sam Houston State University. As of November 
2007,  it  contains  13704  catalogued  artworks,  9440  detailed 
biographical  entries,  a  list  of  references  about  Picasso’s  life 
and works, and a collection of articles from various sources 
regarding the renowned Spanish artist.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>perform  a  dynamic  transformation  into  standards-compliant 
HTML,  achieving  a  clear  separation  between  content  and 
presentation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The OPP includes an interface that allows scholars and users 
in general to browse through the signiﬁ cant events in his life, 
artworks,  and  a  list  of  museums  and  collections  that  hold 
ownership  to  the  various  art  objects  created  by  the  artist 
during his lifetime. The implemented navigation scheme works 
well for experienced scholars who have a deep knowledge of 
Picasso’s life and works. The amount of available information can 
be overwhelming to the project audience, composed primarily 
of  art  scholars  and  historians,  because  of  its  magnitude  and 
painstaking detail. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Humanities rely profoundly on dates to create a strong 
relationship between events and documents. It is obvious to 
assume that key events inﬂ uenced Picasso in such a way, that 
they caused signiﬁ cant changes in artistic style and expression. 
The OPP contains a vast amount of information that could be 
used in conjunction with the proposed interfaces, in order to 
help answer this type of inquiries. The calendars and timelines in 
the OPP propose an alternate method for  exploring an existing 
document collection since they use date-related metadata as 
a discriminating factor, instead of an ordering criterion.  Dates 
are used to provide mechanisms and interfaces that allow rich 
exploration of the artist’s legacy in order to get a more whole 
and concise understanding of his life
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Calendars
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The calendar interfaces were developed to provide a timetable 
for  the  creation  of  artworks  and  occurrence  of  events 
cataloged in the OPP. Their purpose is to provide with a quick 
glance, relevant biographical and artistic dates. Additionally, the 
calendars provide means for formulating direct comparisons 
between dates within a single year. months and seasons. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  calendar  interfaces  have  5  display  possibilities  to  ﬁ lter 
results, which apply to the artworks and to the narrative:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. Show start date and end date: used to display “exact 
matches”. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. Show start date or end date: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. Show start date only: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. Show End date only
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>5. Show Ranges of dates
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>How  does  the  OPP  provide  its  content?  Java  Servlets  are 
used to retrieve the documents and metadata from a MySQL 
database. As a result, a Apache Tomcat web server outputs a 
XML which is linked to XSLTs and CSS. The later are used to 
_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Surrogates  are  provided  in  the  form  of  artwork  thumbnails 
and textual description of the events. Clicking on the speciﬁ ed 
date, month or season produces a web page, where detailed 
descriptions can be accessed. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Colors were added to the dates containing items, to show the 
distribution of the artworks and events. The design decision 
to  include  additional  stratiﬁ cation  schemes  relates  to  the 
research goal of providing an enhanced browsing mechanism. 
The  inclusion  of  this  feature  does  not  implicate  any  greater 
additional  processing  of  the  data,  but  it  provides  a  richer 
environment for browsing the document collection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1: Artwork surrogates – ranges of dates
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The use of calendar interfaces provides new possibilities for 
scholars  and  users  in  general:  the  discovery  of  relationships 
between documents, which standard HTML interfaces do not 
facilitate. The main advantages derived from their use include:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1.  The possibility of visualizing an entire year in Picasso’s 
biography and artistic career. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Through the use of a Calendar-based interface, artworks can 
be  visually  identiﬁ ed  to  their  speciﬁ c  dates  of  creation. This 
provides  a  visualization  mechanism  that  allows  the  user  to 
navigate through a potentially large number of artworks in one 
screen. The number of artworks that can be accessed, depends 
on how esthetically proliﬁ c the artist was in that speciﬁ c year.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 2: Event surrogates – start and end dates
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Additionally, this interface allows the users of the project to 
quickly determine periods where the artist was more proliﬁ c. 
Dates  where  Picasso  was  “active”  are  clearly  visible  and 
identiﬁ able. This  data  stratiﬁ cation  gives  users  an  additional 
layer of information. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For  the  case  of  biographical  events,  a  similar  scenario  is 
created. Users can navigate through an entire year of events, 
and the information is presented in a way that affords quick 
navigation and encourages interaction. Visually, periods where 
more events occurred in Picasso’s life are easily identiﬁ able. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. The possibility of moving to speciﬁ c day, month or season 
within a year in one single interaction with the interface. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Through  the  use  of  information  surrogates,  users  have  the 
possibility of moving to a speciﬁ c day, month or season within 
a  year  with  a  single  click. The  actions  produced  by  scrolling 
through multiple screens are eliminated, and users can view the 
artifacts produced on a speciﬁ c date with ease. Consequently, 
comparisons  between  artworks  can  be  achieved  ﬂ uidly  due 
to the enhancements in the browsing environment. Similarly, 
users can read about the speciﬁ c events in Picasso’s biography 
by visually selecting concrete dates. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  deployment  of  the  Calendar 
interfaces,  produce 
visualizations that enable scholars to determine time periods 
or speciﬁ c dates in Picasso’s life. They serve as a tool that helps 
identify when the artist was more proliﬁ c, as well the opposite: 
when  less  artworks  were  produced. This  analysis  could  also 
be accomplished by browsing through the artwork collection 
but  it  requires  additional  interaction  from  the  user,  which 
at  the  end  equals  more  time  and  effort. The  interfaces  also 
constitute  a  new  way  of  browsing  the  document  collection: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
161
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>visually  and  in  strict  correlation  to  time. They  also  facilitate 
further  exploration  of  artworks  and  events  in  certain  days, 
months, seasons and years.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The advantages gained through the use of timelines include:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. The possibility of grasping visually time-extensions in 
Picasso’s output.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Timelines
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This new browsing mechanism in the OPP, based on the Simile 
Timeline,  was  introduced  by  placing  artworks  as  markers  in 
a time frame. It was designed to allow users to examine the 
artworks produced, along with the recorded events of a given 
year.  Further  modiﬁ cations  were  necessary,  since  the  Simile 
Timeline was designed to support single events occurring in 
one day. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Initially, the timeline was designed to focus only on Picasso’s 
artworks.  This  design  choice  gave  users  great  freedom  to 
explore large amounts of information in a manipulatable visual 
space. However, the biographical events were being excluded. 
These events included in the OPP, are particularly important 
since provide a historical framework, which is crucial to the 
understanding of the artist’s legacy and are tightly bound to 
his work rhythm.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Moreover, some of the artworks produced by Picasso have a 
certain degree of uncertainty in their dates of creation, since 
their start and end dates were not documented. The timelines 
provide a mechanism for dealing with uncertainty, where the 
artworks are represented with a time bar with a lower level of 
saturation in their color. This gives a visual clue that the start 
and end dates are not ﬁ xed, and are subject to speculation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Additional information such as changes in style and location 
were injected to the timeline, which were extracted from the 
artist’s  biography. Their  purpose  is  to  provide  an  additional 
layer of information that can be used to interpret the events 
that  lead  to  the  creation  and  mood  of  certain  artifacts,  and 
thus enhancing the browsing environment.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Picasso worked on several artworks at times, which share a 
similar theme. Even though they share common characteristics, 
they are not identical. Each of these artworks has variations, 
which differentiate them. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On the other hand, the timelines allow users to freely explore 
all  the  artworks  and  events  within  a  given  year,  and  point 
out  their  similarities  and  differences,  and  affords  further 
examination regarding the evolution of a common and shared 
theme. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. The possibility of visually comparing works ordered in 
chronological order.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  timelines  provide  a  mechanism  that  ﬁ lters  artworks 
according to their year of creation. The enhanced navigational 
scheme  provided,  allows  scholars  to  view  artifacts  in 
chronological  order. The  addition  of  surrogates  allows  users 
to point out a speciﬁ c item, and then compare them in relation 
to others through and their time correlation. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. The possibility of seeing correlations between change of 
location and artwork creation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The deployed timelines allow the exploration of correlations 
between location changes and the creation of speciﬁ c artworks. 
Changes in location are marked in the timelines, and clearly 
denote a point in time where exposure to a new or recurring 
context occurred. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 3: Exploring artwork - event correlation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 4: Changes in location
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. The possibility of comparing different stylistic periods as 
they relate to concrete artworks and speciﬁ c locations.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  timelines  produce  a  visualization  that  puts  changes  in 
thematic periods and in locations in a common context, along 
with  the  artworks  that  were  elaborated  in  that  time  span. 
This tool is augmented with the navigational ease of clicking 
through a series of artworks, to compare their characteristics 
and perform a deeper analysis if necessary.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  interfaces  have  been  deployed  taking  into  account  that 
additional  functionality  could  be  introduced  with  ease.  As 
a  consequence,  information  regarding  Picasso’s  writings 
and  poems  will  be  included  into  the  next  iteration  of  the 
timelines and calendars. This will allow a deeper understanding 
of  his  legacy,  since  it  could  potentially  provide  a  greater 
understanding of his artworks and biography. The writings and 
poems constitute a compendium of his thoughts and insights, 
extremely  valuable  because  they  were  written  by  the  artist 
himself.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The timeline interfaces in the OPP, narrow the gap and visually 
correlate  biographical  entries  with  artworks.  They  provide  
scholars  a  bigger  picture  of  Picasso’s  artistic  landscape  and 
how events they could have affected his artworks. The dynamic 
nature of the  web-accessible interfaces facilitate the insertion 
of new documents and metadata and thus altering the graphical 
space, which is not feasible on static and printed editions.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Computer  assisted  reading  and  analysis  of  text  (CARAT) 
has  recently  explored  many  variants  of  what  has  become 
fashionable  to  call  “text  mining”  strategies.  Text  mining 
strategies are theoretically robust on large corpus. However, 
since they mainly operate at a macro textual level, their use is 
still the object of resistance by the expert readers that aim at 
ﬁ ne and minute conceptual analysis. In this paper, we present 
a computer assisted strategy for assisting conceptual analysis 
based  on  automatic  classiﬁ cation  and  annotation  strategies. 
We also report on experiment using this strategy on a small 
philosophical corpus.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conceptual analysis is an expert interpretation methodology 
for  the  systematic  exploration  of  semantic  and  inferential 
properties of set of predicates expressing a particular concept 
in  a  text  or  in  a  discourse  (Desclés,  1997;  Fodor,  1998; 
Brandom,  1994;  Gardenfors,  2000;  Rastier,  2005).  Computer 
assisted reading and analysis of text (CARAT) is the computer 
assistance of this conceptual analysis.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The strategy of CACAT
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our text analysis strategy rests on the 
following main hypothesis:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  expression  of  a  canonical  concept  in  a  text  presents 
linguistics  regularities  some  of  which  can  be  identiﬁ ed  using 
classiﬁ cation algorithms
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This hypothesis itself unwraps into three sub hypothesis:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Hypothesis  1:  conceptual  analysis  can  be  realized  by  the 
contextual exploration of the canonical forms of a concept

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This is realized through the classical concordance 
strategy and variances on a pivotal term and its linguistic 
variants (e.g. mind, mental, mentally, etc.) (Pincemin 
et al., 2006; McCarthy, 2004; Rockwell, 2003).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>was applied. It generated 83 clusters with a mean 8.3 segments 
per class. It is possible to represent spatially the set of words 
in each class. Figure 1 illustrates such a regrouping for cluster 
1.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Hypothesis 2: the exploration of the contexts of a concept is itself 
realized through some mathematical classiﬁ cation strategy.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This second hypothesis postulates that contexts of 
a concept present regularities that can be identiﬁ ed 
by mathematical clustering techniques that rest 
upon similarities found among contextual segments 
(Jain et al. 1999; Manning and Schütze, 1999).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Hypothesis  3:  Classes  of  conceptual  of  similar  conceptual 
contexts  can  be  annotated  so  as  to  categorize  their  semantic 
content.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This last hypothesis allows to associate to each segment of a 
class of contexts some formal description of their content be it 
semantic, logical, pragmatic, rhetorical, etc. (Rastier et al., 2005; 
Djioua  and  Desclés,  2007;  Meyers,  2005;  Palmer  et  al.,  2005; 
Teich et al., 2006). Some of these annotations can be realized 
through algorithms; others can only be done manually.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Experiment
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>From these three hypotheses emerges an experiment which 
unwraps  in  ﬁ ve  phases. This  experiment  was  accomplished 
using  C.S.  Peirce’s  Collected  Papers  (volumes  I-VIII)  (Peirce, 
1931,  1935,  1958).  More  speciﬁ cally,  this  research  aimed 
at  assisting  conceptual  analysis  of  the  concept  of “Mind”  in 
Peirce’s writings.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Phase 1: Text preparation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  methodology,  the  ﬁ rst  phase  is  text  pre-processing. 
The aim of this ﬁ rst phase is to transform the initial corpus 
according to phases 2 and 3 requirements. Various operations 
of  selection,  cleaning,  tokenisation,  and  segmentation  are 
applied. In the experiment we report on, no lemmatisation or 
stemming was used. The corpus so prepared was composed of 
74 450 words (tokens) with a lexicon of 2 831 word types.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1. Graphical representation of cluster 1 lexicon.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It is often on this type of representation that many numerical 
analyses  start  their  interpretation.  One  traditional  critic 
presented  by  expert  analysts  is  their  great  generality  and 
ambiguity. This  kind  of  analysis  and  representation  give  hints 
on the content of documents, but as such it is difﬁ cult to use 
for ﬁ ne grained conceptual analysis. It must hence be reﬁ ned. 
It is here that the annotation phase comes into play.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Phase 4: Annotation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The annotation phase allows the expert reader to make more 
explicit  the  type  of  information  contained  in  each  clusters 
(generated in phase 3). For instance, the interpreter may indicate 
if each cluster is a THEME, a DEFINITION, a DESCRIPTION, 
an  EXPLANATION,  an  ILLUSTRATION,  an  INFERENCE,  or 
what  is  it  MODALITY  (epistemic,  epistemological,  etc.). The 
variety  of  annotation  types  is  in  itself  a  research  object  and 
depends on various textual and linguistic theories.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Phase 2: Key Word In Context (KWIC) 
extraction (concordance)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Annotation results
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Using  the  corpus  pre-processed  in  phase  1,  a  concordance 
is made with the pivotal word “Mind”. The KWIC algorithm 
generated 1 798 contextual segments of an average of 7 lines 
each. In order to be able to manually evaluate the results of the 
computer-assisted conceptual analysis, we decided to select in 
the project only a random sampling of the 1 798 contextual 
segments. The  sampling  algorithm  delivered  717  contextual 
segments. This sample is composed of 3 071 words (tokens) 
and 1 527 type words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this abstract, size constraints do not allow us here to present 
detailed  results  of  classiﬁ cation  and  annotation  processes. 
We shall only present a sample on a few segments of three 
classes.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Annotations of cluster 1: The ﬁ rst cluster contained 17 segments 
all of which have received an annotation. Here are samples of 
annotation  for  two  segments  of  cluster  1. The  annotation  is 
preceded by the citation itself from the original text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>[SEGMENT NO 512]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Phase 3: KWIC clustering
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The concordance is in itself a subtext (of the initial corpus). A 
clustering technique was applied to the concordance results. In

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>“But  it  differs  essentially  from  materialism,  in  that,  instead  of 
supposing  mind  to  be  governed  by  blind  mechanical  law,  it 
supposes the one original law to be the recognized law of mind, 
the law of association, of which the laws of matter are regarded 
as mere special results.”
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>ANNOTATION:  EXPLICATION: The  law  of  mind  is  not  a 
mechanical materialism.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Phase 5: Interpretation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The last phase is the interpretative reading of the annotations. 
Here,  the  interpreter  situates  the  annotated  segments  into 
his  own  interpretative  world.  He  may  regroup  the  various 
types  of  annotation  (DEFINITIONS,  EXPLANTIONS,  etc.) 
and  hence  build  a  speciﬁ c  personal  data  structure  on  what 
he has annotated. From then on, he may rephrase these in his 
own language and style but most of all situate them in some 
theoretical, historical, analytical, hermeneutic, epistemological, 
etc.  perspective.  It  is  the  moment  where  the  interpreter 
generates his synthesis of the structure he believes underlies 
the concept.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  present  here  a  sample  of  the  synthesis  of  conceptual 
analysis  assisted  by  the  CARAT  process  on  cluster  1  (the 
concept of “mind” in C.S. Peirce’s writings – cluster 1).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The law of Mind: association
The Peircian theory of MIND postulates that a mind is governed 
by  laws.  One  of  these  laws,  a  fundamental  one,  is  associative 
(segment  512). This  law  describes  a  habitus  acquired  by  the 
mind when it functions (segment 436).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Association is connectivity
This functioning is one of relation building through connections. 
The connectivity is of a speciﬁ c nature. It realizes a synthesis (à 
la Kant) which is a form of “intellectual” generalisation (segment 
507).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It is physically realized
Such a law is also found in the biological world. It is a law that 
can  be  understood  as  accommodation  (segment  1436).  In 
fact, this law is the speciﬁ c form of the Mind’s dynamic. It is a 
fundamental law. But it is not easy for us to observe it because 
we are victim of a interpretative tradition (segment 1330) that 
understands the laws of mind as laws of nature. This is a typical 
characteristic  of  an “objective  idealism”  (segments  1762  and 
1382). The laws of mind do not belong to mechanist materialism 
(segments 90 and 1382).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>And there exist a variety of categories
There  exist  subdivisions  of  this  law. They  are  related  to  the 
generalisation process that is realised in infanthood, education, 
and  experience. They  are  intimately  related  to  the  growth  of 
consciousness (segments 375 and 325).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This research project explores a Computer-Assisted Reading 
and Analysis of Text (CARAT) methodology. The classiﬁ cation 
and  annotation  strategies  manage  to  regroup  systematically 
segments  of  text  that  present  some  content  regularity. This 
allows  the  interpreter  to  focus  directly  on  the  organized 
content of the concept under study. It helps reveal its various 
dimensions  (deﬁ nitions,  illustrations,  explanations,  inferences, 
etc.).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Still, this research is ongoing. More linguistic transformations 
should  be  applied  so  as  to  ﬁ nd  synonymic  expressions  of  a 
concept. Also, various types of summarization, extraction and 
formal representation of the regularities of each class are to 
be explored in the future.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>But the results obtained so far reinstate the pertinence of the 
concordance as a tool for conceptual analysis. But it situates it 
in a mathematical surrounding that aim at unveiling the various 
dimensions of a conceptual structure. Most of all, we believe 
that  this  methodology  may  possibly  interest  expert  readers 
and analysis for it gives a strong handle and control on their 
interpretation process although assisting them throughout the 
process.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  implicit  connections  and  cross-references  between  and 
within texts, which occur in all print collections, can be made 
explicit in a collection of electronic texts. Correctly encoded 
and  exposed  they  create  a  framework  to  support  resource 
discovery and navigation by following links between topics. This 
framework  provides  opportunities  to  visualise  dense  points 
of  interconnection  and,  deployed  across  otherwise  separate 
collections, can reveal unforeseen networks and associations. 
Thus  approached,  the  creation  and  online  delivery  of  digital 
texts moves from a digital library model with its goal as the 
provision  of  access,  to  a  digital  humanities  model  directed 
towards  the  innovative  use  of  information  technologies  to 
derive new knowledge from our cultural inheritance.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Using this approach the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre 
(NZETC) has developed a delivery system for its collection of 
over 2500 New Zealand and Pacic Island texts using TEI XML, 
the ISO Topic Map technology1 and innovative entity authority 
management. Like a simple back-of-book index but on a much 
grander scale, a topic map aggregates information to provide 
binding points from which everything that is known about a 
given subject can be reached. The ontology which structures 
the relationships between dierent types of topics is based on 
the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model2 and can therefore 
accommodate  a  wide  range  of  types. To  date  the  NZETC 
Topic  Map  has  included  only  those  topics  and  relationships 
which are simple, veriable and object based. Topics currently 
represent authors and publishers, texts and images, as well as 
people and places mentioned or depicted in those texts and 
images. This has proved successful in presenting the collection 
as  a  resource  for  research,  but  work  is  now  underway  to 
expand the structured mark-up embedded in texts to encode 
scholarly  thinking  about  a  set  of  resources.  Topic-based 
navigable  linkages  between  texts  will  include ‘allusions’  and 
‘inﬂ uence’ (both of one text upon another and of an abstract 
idea upon a corpus, text, or fragment of text).3
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Importantly,  the  topic  map  extends  beyond  the  NZETC 
collection  to  incorporate  relevant  external  resources  which 
expose structured metadata about entities in their collection 
(see Figure 1).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Cross-collection  linkages  are  particularly  valuable  where 
they  reveal  interdisciplinary  connections  which  can  provide 
fertile ground for analysis. For example the National Library 
of New Zealand hosts a full text archive of the Transactions 
and Proceedings of the Royal Society containing New Zealand 
science  writing  1868-1961.  By  linking  people  topics  in  the 
NZETC  collection  to  articles  authored  in  the  Royal  Society 
collection  it  is  possible  to  discern  an  interesting  overlap 
between the 19th century community of New Zealand Pakeha 
artists and early colonial geologists and botanists.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In order to achieve this interlinking, between collections, and 
across  institutional  and  disciplinary  boundaries,  every  topic 
must  be  uniquely  and  correctly  identied.  In  a  large,  full  text 
collection the same name may refer to multiple entities,4 while 
a single entity may be known by many names.5 When working 
across  collections  it  is  necessary  to  be  able  to  condently 
identify an individual in a variety of contexts. Authority control 
is  consequently  of  the  utmost  importance  in  preventing 
confusion and chaos.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The library world has of course long worked with authority 
control systems, but the model underlying most such systems 
is  inadequate  for  a  digital  world.  Often  the  identier  for  an 
entity is neither persistent nor unique, and a single name or 
form of a name is unnecessarily privileged (indeed, stands in as 
the entity itself). In order to accommodate our goals for the 
site, the NZETC created the Entity Authority Tool Set (EATS),6 
an authority control system that provides unique, persistent, 
sharable7 identiers for any sort of entity. The system has two 
particular benets in regards to the needs of digital humanities 
researchers  for  what  the ACLS  described  as  a  robust  cyber 
infrastructure.8
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Firstly,  EATS  enables  automatic  processing  of  names  within 
textual material. When dealing with a large collection, resource 
constraints  typically  do  not  permit  manual  processing  -- 
for  example,  marking  up  every  name  with  a  pointer  to  the 
correct  record  in  the  authority  list,  or  simply  recognising 
text strings as names to begin with. To make this process at 
least  semi-automated,  EATS  stores  names  broken  down  (as 
much as possible) into component parts. By keeping track of 
language  and  script  information  associated  with  the  names, 
the system is able to use multiple sets of rules to know how 
to properly glue these parts together into valid name forms. 
So,  for  example,  William  Herbert  Ellery  Gilbert  might  be 
referred to in a text by “William Gilbert”, “W. H. E. Gilbert”, 
“Gilbert, Wm.”, or a number of other forms; all of these can be 
automatically recognised due to the language and script rules 
associated with the system. Similarly Chiang Kai-shek, being a 
Chinese name, should be presented with the family name ﬁ rst, 
and, when written in Chinese script, without a space between 
the name parts (蒋介石).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1: A mention of Samuel Marsden in a given text 
is linked to a topic page for Marsden which in turn 
provides links to other texts which mention him, external 
resources about him and to the full text of works that he 
has authored both in the NZETC collection and in other 
online collections entirely separate from the NZETC.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ability  to  identify  entities  within  plain  text  and  add 
structured,  machine-readable  mark-up  contributes  to  the 
growth  of  electronic  text  corpora  suitable  for  the  types  of 
computational analysis oered by projects such as the MONK 
environment.9 This is, however, distinct from the problem of 
identifying substrings within a text that might be names, but 
that are not found within EATS. This problem, though signicant, 
does  not  fall  within  the  main  scope  of  the  EATS  system.10 
Similarly, disambiguating multiple matches for the same name 
is generally best left to the determination of a human being: 
even date matches are too often problematic.11
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Secondly,  the  system  is  built  around  the  need  to  allow  for 
an  entity  to  carry  sometimes  conﬂ icting,  or  merely  dierent, 
information  from  multiple  sources,  and  to  reference  those 
sources.12  Having  information  from  multiple  sources  aids  in 
the process of disambiguating entities with the same names; 
just as important is being able to link out to other relevant 
resources. For example, our topic page for William Colenso 
links not only to works in the NZETC collection, but also to 
works  in  other  collections,  where  the  information  on  those 
other collections is part of the EATS record.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It is, however, barely sucient to link in this way directly from 
one project to another. EATS, being a web application, can itself 
be exposed to the net and act as a central hub for information 
and  resources  pertaining  to  the  entities  within  the  system. 
Since  all  properties  of  an  entity  are  made  as  assertions  by 
an  organisation,  EATS  allows  multiple  such  organisations  to 
use and modify records without touching anyone else’s data; 
adding data harvesting to the mix allows for centralisation of 
information (and, particularly, pointers to further information) 
without requiring much organisational centralisation.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One beneﬁ t of this approach is handling entities about which 
there  is  substantial  dierence  of  view.  With  topics  derived 
from  research  (such  as  ideas  and  events)  there  are  likely 
to  be  dierences  of  opinion  as  to  both  the  identiﬁ cation  of 
entities  and  the  relationships  between  them.  For  example 
one organisation may see one event where another sees two. 
To be able to model this as three entities, with relationships 
between  them  asserted  by  the  organisations,  a  potentially 
confusing  situation  becomes  clear,  without  any  group  having 
to  give  up  its  own  view  of  the  world. The  EATS  system  can 
achieve this because all information about an entity is in the 
form of a property assertion made by a particular authority in 
a particular record (see ﬁ gure 2).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  technologies  developed  and  deployed  by  the  NZETC 
including EATS are all based on open standards. The tools and  
frameworks that have been created are designed to provide 
durable resources to meet the needs of the academic and wider 
community in that they promote interlinking between digital 
collections and projects and are themselves interoperable with 
other  standards-based  programs  and  applications  including 
web-based  references  tools,  eResearch  virtual  spaces  and 
institutional repositories.

creation  of  the  robust  cyber  infrastructure  that  will,  in  the

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  analyzing  literary  style  through  statistical  methods,  we 
often show our results by plotting graphs of various types, e.g. 
scatterplots,  histograms,  and  dendrograms. While  these  help 
us to understand our results, they always necessarily “ﬂ atten” 
the  data  into  a  2-  dimensional  format.  For  the  purposes  of 
visualization of complex data, we might be better off trying to 
look at it three dimensionally if a suitable vector representation 
of the data is found ﬁ rst. This paper investigates stance in three 
groups  of  popular  ﬁ ction,  namely  romance  ﬁ ction,  detective 
ﬁ ction written by female authors and detective ﬁ ction written 
by  male  authors,  and  presents  the  results  using  both  2 
dimensional and three dimensional visualization.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Romance ﬁ ction and detective novels are both characterized 
by the fact that they all have the same basic story. In romance 
ﬁ ction  it  is  the  story  of  how  the  hero  and  heroine  meet, 
how  their  relationship  develops  and  how  the  happy  ending 
is achieved. In detective ﬁ ction it is the story of the murder, 
the unraveling of the case, the misleading clues and the ﬁ nal 
solution. The same story is being retold over and over again, 
just as in the oral storytelling tradition (Radway 1984:198). The 
reader is not left in suspense of the ﬁ nal outcome and each 
story is different from the others in the details of the events 
and the way the story is told. Through this the reader becomes 
involved in the story and partakes in the emotions, attitudes 
and thoughts of the protagonist. These feelings, emotions and 
moods  are  marked  by  syntactic  and  semantic  features  often 
referred to as markers of stance.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Stance  refers  to  the  expression  of  attitude  and  consists  of 
two  different  types  of  expressions  of  attitude:  evidentiality 
and affect (Biber and Finegan 1989). Evidentiality means that 
the reader becomes privy to the speaker’s attitudes towards 
whatever  knowledge  the  speaker  has,  the  reliability  of  that 
knowledge and how the speaker came about that knowledge. 
Affect refers to the personal attitudes of the speaker, i.e. his/
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>her emotions, feelings, moods, etc. Biber and Finegan (1989) 
investigated  12  different  categories  of  features  deemed  to 
mark  stance:  certainty/doubt  adverbs,  certainty/doubt  verbs, 
certainty/doubt  adjectives,  affective  expressions,  hedges, 
emphatics  and  necessity/possibility/predictive  modals.  They 
showed that different text types are likely to express stance 
in  different  ways.  Opas  and Tweedie  (1999)  studied  stance 
in romance ﬁ ction and showed that three types of romance 
ﬁ ction  can  be  separated  by  their  expression  of  stance. This 
paper continues these studies, paying special attention to the 
visualization of the results.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Materials and methods
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our total corpus is 760 000 words. It consists of three parts: 
romance ﬁ ction, female-authored detective ﬁ ction and male-
authored  detective  ﬁ ction,  all  published  in  the  1990s.  The 
romance ﬁ ction comprises a total of 240 000 words from the 
Harlequin  Presents  series,  the  Regency  Romance  series  and 
Danielle Steel’s works, which are often classiﬁ ed as women’s 
ﬁ ction or ’cross-overs’. The female-authored detective ﬁ ction 
part  of  our  corpus  includes  Patricia  Cornwell,  Sue  Grafton, 
P.D. James, Donna Leon, Ellis Peters, and Ruth Rendell. These 
texts make up 295 000 words. The rest of the corpus (229 000 
words)  is  made  up  of  male-authored  detective  ﬁ ction  texts, 
including  Colin  Dexter,  Michael  Dibdin,  Quintin  Jardine,  Ian 
Rankin and Peter Tremayne.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Principal  components  analysis  was  used  to  reduce  the  12 
markers of stance to three dimensions which describe 52.4% 
of the variation in the data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Results
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  a  previous  study  Opas  and  Tweedie  (2000)  concluded 
that the detective stories seem to mark evidentiality, i.e. the 
characters  express  their  certainty  and  doubt. The  romance 
stories,  on  the  other  hand,  seem  to  mainly  mark  affect,  i.e. 
the  characters  express  their  emotions  and  moods.  In  Biber 
and  Finegan’s  terms  (1989),  the  detective  ﬁ ction  texts  show 
‘interactional evidentiality’ and the romance ﬁ ction texts show 
‘emphatic expression of affect’.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The results in Figures 1 and 2 below show the female-authored 
detective stories in shades of red and yellow, the male-authored 
detective stories in shades of blue and the romance stories in 
shades of black. While in Figure 1 the female-authored texts 
are perhaps slightly more clearly separatable from the others, 
it still seems that all these texts are far more overlapping and 
less  clearly  distinguishable  as  three  groups  than  the  texts  in 
previous studies were. However, broadly speaking, the romance 
texts are in the lower half of the graph, the female-authored 
detective  texts  in  the  upper  half  and  the  male-authored 
detective texts in the middle. What is surprising though is that 
no features seem to “pulling” texts downwards, towards the 
lower  half  of  the  graph;  and  that  the  feature  that “pull”  the 
texts  upwards  include  both  markers  of  certainty/doubt  and 
affect.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure  2  seems  to  show  similar  results.  Here,  perhaps,  the 
female-authored detective texts are even slightly more easily 
separated  from  the  others,  but  the  general  impression  of 
the  male-authored  texts  and  the  romance  texts  overlapping 
remains. Yet again it seems that there are hardly any features 
accounting for the texts on the left-hand side of the graph and 
that the feature “pulling” the texts to the right include both 
features marking evidentiality and those marking affect.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>These  results  are  quite  surprising.  Either  male-authored 
detective  stories  mark  evidentiality  and  affect  in  the  same 
manner as romance ﬁ ction, and here is seems that they don’t 
show  many  features  that  would  mark  stance,  or  there  is 
something more complex at work here. To help us understand 
these  phenomena  better,  we  would  suggest  visualizing  the 
workings of the markers of stance in a 3 dimensional model. 
To  this  end,  we  have  built  a  tool  that  takes  the  principal 
components  analysis  data,  reduces  dimensionality  down  to 
three components with the most energy and presents the data 
with  these  components. The  software  tool  is  implemented 
in  the  MATLAB®  environment  (The  MathWorks,  Inc., 
Massachusetts,  USA)  utilizing  its  3D  graphical  functions. The 
tool is an interactive one, allowing the researcher to turn the 
3D model and look for the angles that best show the clustering 
structure  and  the  differences  between  the  texts.  We  will 
demonstrate how tools such as this one signiﬁ cantly improve 
the researcher’s ability to visualize the research results and to 
interpret them.

for Cross-collection Text 
Analysis

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Monk Project (http://www.monkproject.org/) has for the 
last year been developing a Web-based system for undertaking 
text  analysis  and  visualization  with  large,  full-text  literary 
archives. The primary motivation behind the development of 
this  system  has  been  the  profusion  of  sites  like  the  Brown 
Women  Writers  Project,  Perseus  Digital  Library,  Wright 
American  Fiction,  Early American  Fiction,  and  Documenting 
the American South, along with the vast literary text corpora 
oered by organizations like the Text Creation Partnership and 
Chadwyck-Healey. Every one of these collections represents 
fertile ground for text analysis. But if they could be somehow 
combined,  they  would  constitute  something  considerably 
more powerful: a literary full text-corpus so immense as to be 
larger than anything that has yet been created in the history 
of computing.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The obstacles standing in the way of such a corpus are well 
known.  While  all  of  the  collections  mentioned  above  are 
encoded in XML and most of them are TEI-conformant, local 
variations can be so profound as to prohibit anything but the 
most  rudimentary  form  of  cross-collection  searching. Tagset 
inclusions (and exclusions), local extensions, and local tagging 
and metadata conventions dier so widely among archives, that 
it is nearly impossible to design a generalized system that can 
cross boundaries without a prohibitively cumbersome set of 
heuristics.  Even  with  XML  and TEI,  not  all  texts  are  created 
equal.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>TEI Analytics, a subset of TEI in which varying text collections 
can  be  expressed,  grew  out  of  our  desire  to  make  MONK 
work with extremely large literary text corpora of the sort 
that would allow computational study of literary and linguistic 
change over broad periods of time.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>TEI Analytics
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This is in part why the TEI Consortium provides a number of 
pre-fabricated customizations, such as TEI Math and TEI Lite, 
as  well  as  modules  for  Drama,  transcriptions  of  speech,  and 
descriptions  of  manuscripts.  Roma  (the  successor  to  Pizza 
Chef) similarly allows one to create a TEI subset, which in turn 
may be extended for local circumstances.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>TEI Analytics, which is itself a superset of TEI Tite, is designed 
with a slightly dierent purpose in mind. If one were creating a 
new literary text corpus for the purpose of undertaking text 
analytical work, it might make the most sense to begin with 
one  of  these  customizations  (using,  perhaps, TEI  Corpus).  In 
the case of MONK, however, we are beginning with collections 
that have already been tagged using some version of TEI with 
local extensions. TEI Analytics is therefore designed to exploit 
common denominators in these texts while at the same time 
adding new structures for common analytical data structures 
(like  part-of-speech  tags, 
lemmatizations,  named-entities, 
tokens,  and  sentence  markers). The  idea  is  to  create  a  P5-
compliant format that is designed not for rendering, but for 
analytical operations such as data mining, principle component 
analysis,  word  frequency  study,  and  n-gram  analysis.  In  the 
particular  case  of  MONK,  such  documents  have  a  relatively 
brief lifespan; once documents are converted, they are read in 
by a system that stores the information using a combination 
of object-relational database technology and binary indexing. 
But before that can happen, the texts themselves need to be 
analyzed and re-expressed in the new format.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Implementation
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our basic approach to the problem involves schema harvesting. 
The  TEI  Consortium’s  Roma  tool  (http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/
Roma/) was ﬁ rst used to create a base W3C XML schema for 
TEI P5 documents, which we then extended using a custom 
ODD ﬁ le.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>With  this  basis  in  place,  we  were  able  to  create  an  XSLT 
“meta-stylesheet”  (MonkMetaStylesheet.xsl)  that  consults 
the  target  collection’s W3C  XML  schema  to  determine  the 
form  into  which  the TEI  P4  les  should  be  converted. This 
initial XSLT stylesheet is a meta-stylesheet in the sense that it 
programatically authors another XSLT stylesheet. This second 
stylesheet (XMLtoMonkXML.xsl), which is usually thousands 
of lines long, contains the conversion instructions to get from 
P4 to the TEI Analytics’s custom P5 implementation. Elements 
that  are  not  needed  for  analysis  are  removed  or  re-named 
according  to  the  requirements  of  MONK  (for  example, 
numbered  <div>s  are  replaced  with  un-numbered  <div>s). 
Bibliographical information is critical for text analysis, and both 
copyright and responsibility information must be maintained, 
but  much  of  the  information  contained  in  the  average 
<teiHeader> (like revision histories and records of workﬂ ow) 
are not relevant to the task. For this reason, TEI Analytics uses 
a radically simplied form of the TEI header.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Local  text  collections  vary  not  because  archive  maintainers 
are  contemptuous  toward  standards  or  interoperability,  but 
because particular local circumstances demand customization. 
The nature of the texts themselves may require specialization, 
or  something  about  the  storage,  delivery,  or  rendering 
framework  used  may  favor  particular  tags  or  particular 
structures. Local environments also require particular metadata 
conventions (even within the boundaries of the TEI header).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We believe that TEI Analytics performs a useful niche function 
within  the  larger  ecology  of TEI  by  making  disparate  texts 
usable within a single text analysis framework. Even without 
the need for ingestion into a larger framework, TEI Analytics 
facilitates  text  analysis  of  disparate  source  ﬁ les  simply  by 
creating a consistent and unied XML representation. We also 
believe that our particular approach to the problem of XML 
conversion (a small stylesheet capable of generating massive 
stylesheets through schema harvesting) may be useful in other 
contexts|including,  perhaps,  the  need  to  convert  texts  from 
P4 to P5.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Dictionary  of Words  in  the Wild  [1]  is  an  experiment 
in  social  textuality  and  the  perceptual  dynamics  of  reading. 
The Dictionary is a social image site where contributors can 
upload pictures of words taken “in the wild” and tag them so 
they are organized alphabetically as an online visual dictionary. 
Currently  the  Dictionary  has  2227  images  of  3198  unique 
words  and  24  contributor  accounts.  The  images  uploaded 
and  tagged  are  of  text,  usually  single  words  or  phrases,  that 
appear in the everyday environment. Images uploaded include  
pictures of signs, body tatoos, garbage, posters, grafﬁ ti, labels,  
church  displays,  gravestones,  plastic  bags,  clothing,  art,  labels,  
and  other  sights. The  site  is  structured  with  an  application  
programming interface to encourage unanticipated uses.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> In this paper we will, 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Give a tour through the online social site and its API,
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Discuss current scholarship on public textuality and the  
perceptual dynamics of reading,
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Reﬂ ect on the Dictionary in these contexts, and
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• Conclude with speculations on its possible contributions 
to our understanding of textuality and reading.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Outline of the Dictionary
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The following is a narrative of the demonstration part of the  
presentation.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The Dictionary was developed with Ruby on Rails by Andrew 
MacDonald with support from the TAPoR project under the 
direction of Geoffrey Rockwell. Users can get a free account 
in order to start uploading images. (We discovered once the 
project  was  visible  for  a  few  months  that  spambots  were 
automatically  creating  accounts  so  we  have  introduced  a 
CAPTCHAlike graphical challenge-response feature to weed  
out false accounts.)

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>When  you  upload  a  picture  you  are  given  the  opportunity 
to crop it and are prompted to provide a list of words that 
appear in the text. You can also provide a brief description or 
discussion of the word image.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Dictionary is meant to provoke reﬂ ection on the actual 
verbal environment in its totality, on the moment-by-moment 
encounter with individual words and phrases where one ﬁ nds 
them and on the experience of reading them as each reading 
unfolds.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Once uploaded the image is ﬁ led in a database and the interface  
allows you to access the images in different ways:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• You can click on a letter and browse images with words 
starting with that letter. An image with “On” and “Off” will 
be ﬁ led twice, though at present the label is the ﬁ rst word 
tagged.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• You can search for a word and see the images that have 
been  tagged with that word.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• You can type in a phrase and get a sequence of images.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• You can see what comments have been left by others on 
your images and respond to them.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The API  allows  the  user  to  create  other  processes  or  text 
toys that can query the dictionary and get back an XML ﬁ le 
with the URLs for word images like:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>><phrase>
  <word href=”href_for_image”>Word</word>
  <word>Word_with_no_image</word>
</phrase>
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One of the goals of the project is to support mashups that use 
the dictionary for new projects. This is where the Dictionary 
is different than other such projects, many of which use Flickr 
to pull images of letters or words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Theoretical Discussion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Dictionary  is  an  exploratory  project  designed  to 
encourage the gathering of images of words in the wild and 
to provoke thinking about our encounters with these words. 
It did not start with an articulated theory of text that it set 
out  to  illustrate,  nor  in  the  contributors’  experience  does 
the actual collecting of words tend to be governed by this or 
that theory. Rather, in its simplicity, the Dictionary encourages 
participants to document public textuality as they encounter 
and perceive it.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At least in the initial phase of the project, the designers have  
imposed no rules or guidelines for the collecting, editing and  
tagging of words. Although it is clear that certain requirements 
for entering words into the Dictionary would make subsequent 
research questions easier to pursue, the designers prefer not 
to impose them so as to discover what in fact participants ﬁ nd 
to be interesting and practical to record. Because recording of 
words is voluntary and would seem inevitably to be limited to 
a few individuals, the time and effort required must be kept to 
a minimum in order to have a collection sufﬁ ciently large to 
allow the research potential of the Dictionary to emerge.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Collecting  of  verbal  images  for  the  Dictionary  presents 
collectors with a way of defamiliarizing familiar environments. 
Conventional techniques for framing a photograph and digital 
tools for cropping it give them limited but surprisingly powerful 
means of recording defamiliarized sights. Additional means are 
provided  by  a  commentary  feature,  but  the  amount  of  time 
required  to  compose  this  commentary  tends  to  discourage 
much of it. Theoretical reﬂ ection on the encounter with words 
in the wild would seem to require participation in the project 
to be adequate to the data. For this reason collecting is not a 
task to be done separately from theorizing. Whatever theory  
is to emerge will come from participant observation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  some  cases,  we  have  found,  what  appears  interesting  to 
record is relatively static, requiring little compositional care or 
subsequent cropping. In many cases, however, the experience 
of reading is a dynamic event, as when part of a verbal message, 
not necessarily ﬁ rst in normal reading order, is perceived ﬁ rst, 
then  submerged  into  the  overall  syntax  of  its  verbal  and/or 
visual environment. In other cases, the experience may include 
a speciﬁ c detail of the environment in which the text of interest 
is embedded but not be informed signiﬁ cantly by other details. 
Occasionally one has sufﬁ cient time to frame a photograph to 
capture the experience adequately, but most often photographs 
must be taken quickly, as when unwelcome attention would be 
drawn to the act of photography or the  situation otherwise 
advises stealth (an inscription on a t-shirt, for example). The 
Dictionary, one might say, is a record of psycholinguistic events 
as much or more than simply of environmental data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In more theoretical terms, is the project aims to study how 
language acts as a semiotic system materially placed in the real 
word. In order to interpret this multidimensional, “semiotic” 
role of language, our analysis focuses on how dictionary users 
perceive  different  signs  and  attribute  meanings  to  words  by 
referring to these signs. We will argue that through this kind 
of  visual  dictionary  contributors  can  interact  and  play  with 
language by using visual artifacts (photos, images, grafﬁ ti etc) 
to express and deﬁ ne the meanings of words. We have strong 
theoretical  reasons  for  regarding  text  as  co-created  by  the 
reader  in  interaction  with  the  verbal  signs  of  the  document 
being  read. The  Dictionary  gives  the  reader  of  words  in  the 
wild a means of implementing the act of reading as co-creative, 
but  with  a  signiﬁ cant  difference  from  those  acts  that  have  
previously been the focus of theoretical work. The collector 
of wild words, like the reader of literature, is obviously not so 
much a viewer as a producer of meaning, but unlike the literary 
reader, the collector is operating in a textual ﬁ eld whose real-
world context is highly unlikely ever to be otherwise recorded. 
It  so  obviously  goes  without  saying  that  it  also  goes  by  and 
vanishes without ever being studied.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The title of the project suggests a distinction between text in 
two different places: the kind at home and the kind in the wild. 
But  the  collector’s  gaze  rapidly  suggests  that  the  distinction 
is  only  in  part  one  of  place. Text  at  home  can  also  be ‘wild’ 
if it can be defamiliarized, e.g. the title of a book on its spine 
taken in poor light conditions inside a house. The wildness of 
words, is then ‘in the eye of the beholder’, though the domestic 
environment  is  usually  so  well  regulated  that  opportunities 
for perceiving wildness are far more limited than in relatively 
undomesticated  environments.  Thus  such  opportunities 
tend  to  occur  far  less  frequently  in  well-kept  or  wealthy 
neighbourhoods  than  in  poorly  kept  ones,  where  rubbish  is 
frequently encountered and advertising of all kinds is evident. 
This  suggests  ironically  that  poorer  neighbourhoods  are  in 
respect of the sheer amount of reading more rather than less 
literate. But the correlation between wealth and verbosity is 
not so straightforward. Airport lounges, for example, are rich 
in examples of wild words. What would seem to matter in this 
correlation  is  the  acquisitive  desire  of  the  population:  those 
who have tend not to read for more.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Such  theorizing,  however,  is  clearly  at  a  quite  preliminary 
stage. The  project  calls  for  a  more  systematic  ethnography 
of  textuality  and  its  everyday  occurence.  Insofar  as  it  can 
be  conceptualized,  the  long-term  goal  of  the  project  can  be 
put as a question: would it be possible to develop a panoptic 
topology  of  the  appearance  of  the  legible  in  everyday  life,  if 
even just for one person?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  paper  will  conclude  with  some  images  and  the  future  
directions they have provoked:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• We need to parse phrases so that we remove punctuation. 
For example, “faith,” won’t ﬁ nd the image for “faith”.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• We need to allow implicit words to be entered with 
parentheses where the word doesn’t appear, but is 
implicit. An example would be http://tapor1-dev.mcmaster.
ca/~dictwordwild/show/694 which is ﬁ led under “Average” 
even though the word doesn’t appear.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• We need to allow short phrasal verbs and compounds to 
be  entered with quotation marks so they are ﬁ led as one 
item.  An example would be “come up” or “happy days”.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• We need to allow images of longer passages to identiﬁ ed 
as  “Sentences in the Sticks”, “Phrases in the Fields” or 
“Paragraphs in the Pastures”. These would not be ﬁ led 
under individual words, but the full text could be searched.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• We need to allow people to control capitalization so that, 
for example, “ER” (which stands for “Emergency Room”) is 
not rendered as “Er”.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• We need to let people add tags that are not words so 
images can be sorted according to categories like “Grafﬁ ti” 
or “Billboard”.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Dictionary is one of a number of projects that use the 
internet to share images of textuality. For example, Typography 
Kicks Ass: Flickr Bold Italic [2] is Flash toy that displays messages 
left  by  people  using  letters  from  Flickr. The  London  Evening 
Standard  Headline  Generator  [3]  from  thesurrealist.co.uk

IllegalSigns.ca  [4]  tracks  illegal  billboards  in Toronto  and  has 
a  Clickable  Illegal  Signs  Map  [5]  that  uses  Google  Maps.  On 
Flickr one can ﬁ nd sets like Its Only Words [6] of images of 
texts.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>What all these projects have in common is the photographic 
gaze  that  captures  words  or  phrases  in  a  context  whether 
for aesthetic purposes or advocacy purposes. The Dictionary 
is no different, it is meant to provoke reﬂ ection on the wild 
context of text as it is encountered on the street.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>> The Future
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  success  of  the  project  lies  in  how  the  participants 
push  the  simple  assumptions  encoded  in  the  structure. The 
project  would  have  failed  had  no  one  contributed,  but  with 
contributions  come  exceptions  to  every  design  choice. The 
types of text contributors want to collect and formally tag has 
led to the speciﬁ cation of a series of improvements that are 
being  implemented  with  the  support  of TAPoR  and  SSHRC.

Researching Opportunities in 
the Field of Art-theoretical 
Terminology

University of Málaga, Spain
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  purpose  of  this  presentation  is  to  demonstrate  the 
research opportunities that the TTC-ATENEA system offers 
to  specialists  in  Art  Theory.  Principally,  we  will  focus  on 
those  functionalities  that  are  able  to  assist  specialists  in  the 
interpretation  of  the  theoretical  discourses,  a  complex  task 
due to the ambiguity and inaccuracy that distinguish this type 
of artistic terminology.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The TTC-ATENEA system is currently being developed under 
my  supervision  in  a  Project  supported  by  the  Ministerio  de 
Educación  y  Ciencia  of  Spain  called  Desarrollo  de  un  tesauro 
terminológico  conceptual  (TTC)  de  los  discursos  teórico-artísticos 
españoles  de  la  Edad  Moderna,  complementado  con  un  corpus 
textual  informatizado  (ATENEA)  (HUM05-00539).  It  is  an 
interdisciplinary project integrated by the following institutions: 
University  of  Málaga  (Spain),  University  of  de  Santiago  de 
Compostela  (Spain),  University  of Valencia  (Spain),  European 
University of Madrid (Spain), the Getty Research Institute (Los 
Angeles, EE.UU.), the University of Chicago (EE.UU.) and the 
Centro de Documentación de Bienes Patrimoniales of Chile. 
Also, it maintains a fruitful collaboration with the Department 
of  Computational  Languages  and  Sciences  of  the  University 
of  Málaga,  speciﬁ cally  with  the  Project  called  ISWeb:  Una 
Infraestructura Básica para el Desarrollo de La Web Semántica y su 
Aplicación a la Mediación Conceptual (TIN2005-09098-C05-01).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This system can be deﬁ ned as a virtual net made up of two 
complementary  components:  an  electronic  text  database 
(ATENEA),  and  the  terminological  conceptual  thesaurus 
(TTC). The TTC  is  a  knowledge  tool  for  art  specialists  that 
consists  of  a  compilation  of  described,  classiﬁ ed  and  linked 
terms and concepts. The textual database consists of important 
art-historical  texts  (16th  -18th  centuries),  encoded  in  XML-
TEI (1), that supply the terms and concepts recorded in the 
thesaurus (2).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  want  to  remark  the  signiﬁ cant  contribution  of ATENEA 
database to the ﬁ eld of the virtual and digital libraries in Spain. 
Despite the fact that the building of digital and virtual libraries 
is an important area of development (3), ATENEA represents 
one  of  the  ﬁ rst  textual  databases  about  specialized  subject 
matter –with exception of the digital libraries on literary texts- 
(4). It is a very different situation from other contexts, where 
we  ﬁ nd  relevant  specialized  electronic  textual  collections.  It 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>is  the  case,  for  example,  of  the  digital  libraries  about  Italian 
artistic  texts  developed  and  managed  by  Signum  (Scuola 
Normale Superiore di Pisa) (5); or the collections included in 
the ARTFL Project (University of Chicago) (6).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Providing Solutios to the Ambiguity of 
Art-theoretical Terminology
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The conﬁ guration of the ATENEA-TTC system was determined 
by the main purpose of the project itself--that is, to provide 
a  satisfactory  answer  to  the  terminological/conceptual 
problems  that  encumber  the  task  of  conducting  research  in 
art theory, due to the high degree of semantic density of the 
terminology contained in historical documents. In this respect, 
it is important to point out that the objective of the Project is 
not only to distinguish the terminological polysemy, that is, the 
different concepts that a term denotes (i.e., disegno as product, 
disegno  as  abstract  concept, disegno  as  formal  component  of 
the paintings…), but also the different interpretations that the 
same  concept  assumes  in  discourses  belonging  to  different 
authors. For instances, the concept disegno, understood as an 
abstract concept, has not the same interpretation in Zuccaro´s 
treatise than in Vasari´s one, what implies that the term disegno 
does not mean exactly the same in such texts. Indeed, this is 
one of the more problematic aspects of textual interpretation, 
since  the  same  term  assumes  different  semantic  nuances  in 
each text or treatise, increasing, in that way, the possibilities 
for ambiguity and error.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  connection  with  this  question,  the  eminent  Professor 
Fernando  Marías  (7)  has  suggested  the  development  of  a 
“cronogeografía” of the art-theoretical concepts and terms. In 
his words, the so-called “cronogeografía” should be a precise 
means  of  control  of  the  emergence  and  use  of  the  theoretical 
vocabulary as well as of the ideas behind this. We consider that 
the methodology proposed by this Project could be an answer 
to Professor Marías´ suggestion.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It  is  clear  that  this  approach  requires,  ﬁ rstly,  a  comparative 
conceptual analysis among the artistic texts stored in ATENEA 
in  order  to  identify  the  different  interpretations  of  each 
concept and, as a result, the semantic variations assumed by 
every term. To make visible in the thesaurus these semantic-
conceptual  distinctions,  we  have  proceeded  to  tag  concepts 
and terms by mean of parenthetical qualiﬁ ers related to authors, 
which  have  been  speciﬁ cally  developed  to  this  end.  These 
qualiﬁ ers  specify  the  author  who  has  used  or  deﬁ ned  them. 
Thus,  the  TTC  records  the  conceptual-semantic  variations 
among concepts and terms used by different authors, and also 
shows them graphically and visually. For example, the following 
representation generated by the system (ﬁ gure 1):
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fig. 1. Uses and interpretations of vagueza in

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>reveals us, at a glance, that vagueza has the same interpretation 
in  Sigüenza  and  Santos´s  discourses,  but  that  this  assumes 
other senses in Carducho and Martinez´s treatises.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  procedure  implies  other  signiﬁ cant  feature  of  the 
ATENEA-TTC system: that terms and concepts are described 
in the TTC according to how they has been used or deﬁ ned in 
each particular text. This last point deserves to be emphasized. 
Effectively, there are other projects that also link terms to online 
dictionary entries, in which the user ﬁ nds general deﬁ nitions 
of the terms. Nevertheless, in the TTC terms and concepts are 
deﬁ ned in reference to the speciﬁ c texts in where they have 
been located. So, clicking on the selected term or concept, the 
user  gets  information  about  how  such  term  or  concept  has 
been speciﬁ cally used and deﬁ ned in a particular text or by a 
particular author.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  addition  to  that,  the TTC-ATENEA  system  provides  full 
interaction  between  the ATENEA  corpus  and  the TTC. The 
system easily allows the deﬁ nition of connections between a 
term or a concept in an XML-TEI marked text and the registry 
of the TTC. Thus, terms and concepts in the text are linked 
to all their relevant information, stored and structured in the 
TTC records. In the same way, the system allows to establish 
a connection between terms and concepts registered in the 
TTC and the different places where they appear in the XML-
TEI marked texts. As far as XML-TEI marked texts and TTC 
are stored in the same database, we can establish these links in 
a totally effective and efﬁ cient way without having to access to 
different data repositories to retrieve and link this information. 
Consequently,  one  of  the  most  important  potentialities  of 
the  system  as  a  research  tool  derives  from  the  interactions 
that users are able to establish among the different types of 
information compiled in each repository.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Finally,  future  extensions  of  the  TTC-ATENEA  will  study 
the  possibility  of  use  not  only  a  thesaurus  but  a  full ﬂ edged 
OWL [7] ontology and its integration in the Khaos Semantic

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. TTC as a starting point. Imagine now that the specialist is 
interested in the use of a particular term. In this case, the most 
convenient is to search the term in the TTC. Made the query, 
the  specialist  retrieves  the  different  concepts  associated  to 
the term, as in a conventional specialized dictionary. However, 
as the term is marked with the author-parenthetical qualiﬁ ers,  
the specialist also ﬁ nds out in which discourses the term has 
been  identiﬁ ed  denoting  each  concept  (see  ﬁ gure1).  In  fact, 
various hyperlinks enable him to go from the TTC record to 
the exact point of the texts -stored in ATENEA- where the 
term appears denoting such concepts (ﬁ gure 3). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Web platform [8] [9] [10] in order to achieve a formal explicit 
representation  of  the  artistic  epistemology  contained  in  the 
texts.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Research Possibilities
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  system  allows  users  to  retrieve  the  stored  information 
from both terminological-conceptual and textual repositories. 
Nevertheless, as indicated above, the most important research 
possibilities  derive  from  the  interactions  that  users  are  able 
to establish between each repository. To illustrate this, we will 
give a brief example.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. ATENEA  Corpus  as  a  starting  point.  Imagine  that  a 
specialist is interested in studying the meanings of the terms 
used  by  the  Italian  author  F.  Pacheco  in  his  Spanish  treatise 
(Diálogos  de  la  Pintura,  1633). ATENEA  Corpus  enables  the 
specialist to visualize the electronic transcription of the text, 
and  explore  it  linguistically  by  means  of  different  queries  -
concordances,  frequency  lists,  co-occurrences…-  since  the 
system has been implemented with its own textual analyzer. 
These  functionalities  do  not  constitute  any  novelty;  all  we 
know that. Consequently, the most relevant feature resides in 
the fact that the system allows user to browse directly from 
a term or concept located in a text to the TTC record where 
such  term  or  concept  is  described  according  to  its  use  in 
Carducho´s text (ﬁ gure 2). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fig. 3. Connection between a concept registered in the TTC and 
the places where they appear in the XML-TEI marked texts.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Once in ATENEA Corpus, the specialist has the opportunity 
to use its functionalities in order to specify his investigation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The presentation will show in full detail these possibilities of 
usage derived from this interactivity-based approach, and will 
include  time  for  Q&A. We  believe  that  the  questions  taken 
into  consideration  in  our  exposition  will  be  of  interest  to 
other  humanistic  disciplines,  since  the  difﬁ culties  of  textual 
interpretations  due  to  the  terminological  ambiguity  is  a 
common place in the ﬁ eld of the Humanities.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Fig. 2. Connection between a concept in an XML-TEI marked 
text (ATENEA) and the TTC record, where it is described.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this way, the specialist is able to identify the precise senses 
that  the  terms  used  by  Carducho  assume,  and,  therefore, 
analyze with more accuracy his theory about the painting.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Once  the  specialist  has  accessed  to  the TTC  records,  the 
system  offers  him  other  research  possibilities  given  that 
the  recorded  information  is  linked  to  other  sections  of  the 
TTC  as  well  as  to  other  texts  stored  in ATENEA. Thus,  the 
specialist  is  able  to  go  more  deeply  in  his  investigation  and 
to get complementary information browsing through the site. 
The presentation will show some clarifying examples of these 
other possibilities.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Encyclopédie  of  Denis  Diderot  and  Jean  le  Rond 
d’Alembert is one of the crowning achievements of the French 
Enlightenment. Mobilizing many of the great – and the not-so-
great – philosophes of the eighteenth century, it was a massive 
reference  work  for  the  arts  and  sciences,  which  sought  to 
organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while at 
the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. The highly 
complex structure of the work, with its series of classiﬁ cations, 
cross-references  and  multiple  points  of  entry  makes  it  not 
only,  as  has  been  often  remarked,  a  kind  of  forerunner  of 
the internet[1], but also a work that constitutes an ideal test 
bed  for  exploring  the  impact  of  new  machine  learning  and 
information retrieval technologies. This paper will outline our 
ongoing research into the ontology of the  Encyclopédie , a data 
model based on the classes of knowledge assigned to articles 
by the editors and representing, when organized hierarchically, 
a  system  of  human  understanding.  Building  upon  past  work, 
we intend to move beyond the more traditional text and data 
mining approaches used to categorize individual articles and 
towards a treatment of the entire encyclopedic system as it 
is elaborated through the distribution and interconnectedness 
of the classes of knowledge. To achieve our goals, we plan on 
using a vector space model and centroid-based clustering to 
plot  the  relationships  of  the    Encyclopédie‘s  epistemological 
categories,  generating  a  map  that  will  hopefully  serve  as  a 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  vector  space  model  is  a  standard  framework  in  which 
to  consider  text  mining  questions. Within  this  model,  each 
article is represented as a vector in a very high-dimensional 
space  where  each  dimension  corresponds  to  the  words  in 
our  vocabulary. The  components  of  our  vectors  can  range 
from simple word frequencies, to n-gram and lemma counts, 
in  addition  to  parts  of  speech  and  tf-idf  (term  frequency-
inverse document frequency), which is a standard weight used 
in information retrieval. The goal of tf-idf is to ﬁ lter out both 
extremely  common  and  extremely  rare  words  by  offsetting 
term  frequency  by  document  frequency.  Using  tf-idf  weights, 
we will store every article vector in a matrix corresponding to 
its class of knowledge. We will then distill these class matrices 
into individual class vectors corresponding to the centroid of 
the matrix.[5]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Centroid or mean vectors have been employed in classiﬁ cation 
experiments  with  great  success.[6] While  this  approach  is 
inherently lossy, our initial research suggests that by ﬁ ltering 
out function words and lemmatizing, we can reduce our class 
matrices in this way and still retain a distinct class core. Using 
standard vector space similarity measures and an open-source 
clustering engine we will cluster the class vectors and produce 
a  new  tree  of  knowledge  based  on  semantic  similarity. We 
expect the tree to be best illustrated as a weighted undirected 
graph,  with  fully-connected  sub-graphs.  We  will  generate 
graphs using both the original classiﬁ cations and the machine’s 
decisions as our labels.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Due to the size and scale of the Encyclopédie, its editors adopted 
three  distinct  modes  of  organization  -  dictionary/alphabetic, 
hierarchical classiﬁ cation, and cross-references - which, when 
taken together, were said to represent encyclopedic knowledge 
in all its complexity.[7] Using the machine learning techniques 
outlined  above,  namely  vector  space  analysis  and  centroid-
based  clustering,  we  intend  to  generate  a  fourth  system  of 
organization based on semantic similarity. It is our hope that a 
digital representation of the ordering and interconnectedness 
of  the  Encyclopédie  will  highlight  the  network  of  textual 
relationships as they unfold within the work itself, offering a 
more  inclusive  view  of  its  semantic  structure  than  previous 
abstractions could provide. This new “tree of knowledge” can 
act as a complement to its predecessors, providing new points 
of entry into the Encyclopédie while at the same time suggesting 
previously unnoticed relationships between its categories.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>corollary to the taxonomic and iconographic representations 
of knowledge found in the 18th century.[2]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Over the past year we have conducted a series of supervised 
machine  learning  experiments  examining  the  classiﬁ cation 
scheme found in the Encyclopédie, the results of which were 
presented  at  Digital  Humanities  2007.  Our  intent  in  these 
experiments was to classify the more than 22,000 unclassiﬁ ed 
articles using the known classes of knowledge as our training 
model.  Ultimately  the  classiﬁ er  performed  as  well  as  could 
be expected and we were left with 22,000 new classiﬁ cations 
to  evaluate. While  there  were  certainly  too  many  instances 
to  verify  by  hand,  we  were  nonetheless  encouraged  by  the 
assigned  classiﬁ cations  for  a  small  sample  of  articles.  Due 
to  the  limitations  of  this  exercise,  however,  we  decided  to 
leverage the information given us by the editors in exploring 
the known classiﬁ cations and their relationship to each other 
and then later, to consider the classiﬁ cation scheme as a whole 
by examining the general distribution of classes over the entire 
work  as  opposed  to  individual  instances.  Using  the  model 
assembled  for  our  ﬁ rst  experiment  -  trained  on  all  of  the 
known classiﬁ cations - we then reclassiﬁ ed all of the classiﬁ ed 
articles. Our goal in the results analysis was twofold: ﬁ rst, we 
were curious as to the overall performance of our classiﬁ cation 
algorithm, i.e., how well it correctly labeled the known articles; 
and secondly, we wanted to use these new classiﬁ cations to 
examine the outliers or misclassiﬁ ed articles in an attempt to 
understand better the presumed coherency and consistency 
of the editors’ original classiﬁ cation scheme.[3]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  examining  some  of  the  reclassiﬁ ed  articles,  and  in  light 
of  what  we  know  about  Enlightenment  conceptions  of 
human  knowledge  and  understanding  –  ideas  for  which  the 
Encyclopédie and its editors were in no small way responsible 
–  it  would  seem  that  there  are  numerous  cases  where  the 
machine’s  classiﬁ cation  is  in  fact  more  appropriate  than 
that of the editors. The machine’s inability to reproduce the 
editors’  scheme  with  stunning  accuracy  came  somewhat  as 
a surprise and called into question our previous assumptions 
about  the  overall  structure  and  ordering  of  their  system  of 
knowledge.  Modeled  after  Sir  Francis  Bacon’s  organization 
of  the  Sciences  and  human  learning,  the  Système  Figuré  des 
connaissances humaines is a typographical diagram of the various 
relationships  between  all  aspects  of  human  understanding 
stemming from the three “root” faculties of Reason, Memory, 
and  Imagination.[4]  It  provides  us,  in  its  most  rudimentary 
form,  with  a  view  from  above  of  the  editors’  conception  of 
the  structure  and  interconnectedness  of  knowledge  in  the 
18th century. However, given our discovery that the editors’ 
classiﬁ cation scheme is not quite as coherent as we originally 
believed, it is possible that the Système ﬁ guré and the expanded 
Arbre généalogique des sciences et arts, or tree of knowledge, as 
spatial abstractions, were not loyal to the complex network 
of contextual relationships as manifested in the text. Machine 
learning and vector space analysis offer us the possibility, for 
the  ﬁ rst  time,  to  explore  this  network  of  classiﬁ cations  as 
a  whole,  leveraging  the  textual  content  of  the  entire  work 
rather than relying on external abstractions.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Controversy  surrounds  the  methodology  used  in  non-
traditional  authorship  attribution  studies  --  those  studies 
that  make  use  of  the  computer,  stylistics,  and  the  computer. 
[Rudman  2003]  [Rudman  1998]  One  major  problem  is 
that  many  of  the  most  commonly  used  statistical  tests  have 
assumptions  about  the  input  data  that  do  not  hold  for  the 
primary  data  of  these  attribution  studies  --  the  textual  data 
itself  (e.g.  normal  distributions,  randomness,  independence). 
“...inappropriate  statistical  methods....In  particular,  asymtotic 
normality  assumptions  have  been  used  unjustiﬁ ably,  leading 
to ﬂ awed results.” [Dunning, p.61] “Assumptions such as the 
binomiality  of  word  counts  or  the  independence  of  several 
variables  chosen  as  markers  need  checking.”  [Mosteller  and 
Wallace]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper looks at some of the more frequently used tests 
(e.g. chi-square, Burrows Delta) and then at the questions, “Are 
there assumptions behind various tests that are not mentioned 
in the studies?” and “Does the use of statistical tests whose 
assumptions are not met invalidate the results?” Part I of this 
paper was presented at the “10th Jubilee Conference of the 
International  Federation  of  Classiﬁ cation  Societies,”  28  July 
2006 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The idea behind Part I was to get 
as much input as possible from a cross-section of statisticians 
from  around  the  world.  Part  II  takes  the  statisticians’  input 
and  continues  looking  at  the  problem  of  assumptions  made 
by various statistical tests used in non-traditional attribution 
studies.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Because  of  the  complicated  intertwining  of  disciplines  in 
non-traditional  authorship  attribution,  each  phase  of  the 
experimental design should be as accurate and as scientiﬁ cally 
rigorous as possible. The systematic errors of each step must 
be computed and summed so that the attribution study can 
report  an  overall  systematic  error  --  Mosteller  and Wallace 
come close to doing this in their “Federalist” study -- and it 
seems that no one else tries.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It is the systematic error that drives the focus of this paper -- 
the assumptions behind the statistical tests used in attribution 
studies.  I  am  not  concerned  with  assumptions  made  by 
practitioners  that  are  not  an  integral  part  of  the  statistics  -
- e.g. Morton, using the cusum technique, assumes that style 
markers  are  constant  across  genre  --  this  has  been  shown 
to be false but has nothing to do with the cusum test itself. 
[Sanford et al.]
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There  are  many  statistical  tests  along  with  their  many 
assumptions that are used in non-traditional attribution studies 
- e.g the Efron-Thisted tests are based on the assumption that 
things (words) are well mixed in time [Valenza] -- obviously 
not  true  in  attribution  studies.  Because  of  time  constraints, 
I  want  to  limit  the  number  of  tests  discussed  to  three:  the 
chi-square,  Burrows’  Delta,  and  the  third  being  more  of  a 
`catagory’ -- machine learning.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper looks at each test and attempts to explain why the 
assumptions exist -- how they are determined -- how integral 
assumptions are to the use of the test.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Chi-Square test
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  chi-square  test,  in  all  of  its  manifestations,  is  ubiquitous 
in  non-traditional  authorship  studies.  It  also  is  the  test  that 
has  recieved  the  most  criticism  from  other  practitioners.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Almost  all  machine  learning  statistical  techniques  assume

problems.” [Hand et al., 289]

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Does Size Matter? A Re-
examination of a Time-
proven Method
Jan Rybicki
jrybicki@ap.krakow.pl
Pedagogical University, Krakow, Poland
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Previous  stylometric  studies  (Rybicki  2006,  2006a,  2007)  of 
patterns  in  multivariate  diagrams  of  correlation  matrices 
derived from relative frequencies of most frequent words in 
character  idiolects  (Burrows  1987)  in  a  number  of  originals 
and translations (respectively, Sienkiewicz’s trilogy of historical 
romances  and  its  two  English  translations;  Rybicki’s  Polish 
translations of novels by John le Carré; and the three English 
versions  of  Hamlet,  Q1,  Q2,  F,  and  its  translations  into  nine 
different languages) have all yielded interesting similarities in 
the layout of data points in the above-mentioned diagrams for 
corresponding originals and translations. The repetitiveness of 
the  observed  phenomenon  in  many  such  pairs  immediately 
raised some questions as to its causes – the more so as the 
most-frequent-word lists for any original and its translations, 
consisting  primarily  of  functions  words,  modals,  pronouns, 
prepositions and articles (if any in a given language) contains 
few direct counterparts in any two languages.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  primary  suspect  for  a  possible  bias  was  the  difference 
in size between the parts of individual characters, since that 
particular  feature  invariably  remains  proportionally  similar 
between  original  and  translation  (Rybicki  2000). The  import 
of  this  element  remained  unnoticed  in  many  other  studies 
employing  Burrows’s  time-proven  method  (later  developed, 
evaluated and applied by a number of scholars, including Hoover 
2002) since they were either conducted on equal samples or, 
more importantly, although some did address the problem of 
translation,  they  never  dealt  with  so  many  translations  at  a 
time as did e.g. the Hamlet study (Rybicki 2007).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  emerging  suspicion  was  that  since  the  sizes  of  the 
characters studied do not vary signiﬁ cantly between the twelve 
versions  of  Hamlet,  this  proportion  might  heavily  inﬂ uence 
the multivariate graphs produced – the more so as, in most 
cases, the most talkative characters occupied central positions 
in  the  graphs,  while  the  lesser  parts  were  usually  limited  to 
the  peripheries. This  (together  with  similar  effects  observed 
in earlier studies) had to lead to a reassessment of the results. 
Also, since most studies were conducted in traditional male-
dominated  writing,  resulting  in  female  characters  speaking 
little  in  proportion  even  to  their  importance  in  the  plot, 
these peripheries usually included separate groups of women; 
while this was often seen as the authors’ ability to stylistically 
differentiate “male”  and “female”  idiom,  the  size  bias  could 
distort even this quite possible effect.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  number  of  tests  was  then  performed  on  character 
idiolects and narrative fragments of various sizes and various 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>conﬁ gurations  of  characters  from  selected  English  novels 
and  plays  –  ranging  from  Ruth  and  David  Copperﬁ eld;  from 
Conan Doyle to Poe; narration in Jane Austen, or plays by Ben 
Jonson  and  Samuel  Beckett  –  to  investigate  how  the  impact 
of size distorts the image of stylistic differences presented in 
multivariate diagrams.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One possible source of the bias is the way relative frequencies 
of  individual  words  are  calculated.  Being  a  simple  ratio  of 
word  frequency  to  size  of  sample,  it  may  be  as  unreliable 
as  another  very  similar  formula,  the  type-to-token  ratio  (or, 
indeed,  one  as  complex  as Yule’s  K),  has  been  found  to  be 
unreliable  as  a  measure  of  vocabulary  richness  in  samples 
of  different  size  (Tweedie  &  Baayen  1997). Also,  due  to  the 
nature of multivariate analyses used (both Factor Analysis and 
Multimensional Scaling), it is not surprising that the less stable 
statistics of the less talkative characters would have their data 
points pushed to the peripheries of the graph. Finally, since the 
list of the most frequent words used in the analysis is most 
heavily inﬂ uenced by the longest parts in any text, this might 
also  be  the  reason  for  the “centralising”  bias  visible  in  data 
points for such characters.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It  should  be  stressed  that  the  above  reservations  do  not, 
in  any  way,  invalidate  the  entire  method;  indeed,  results  for 
samples of comparative size remain reliable and unbiased. Also, 
it should not be forgotten that size of a character’s part is in 
itself an individuating feature of that character.

Philology in a Digital Age

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  signiﬁ cant  number  of  digital  editions  have  been  published 
in  recent  years,  and  many  of  these  serve  as  exemplars  for 
those  of  us  working  within  the  digital  editing  community. A 
glance at Electronic Text Editing, for example, published in 2006, 
indicates that such projects address a wide berth of editorial 
problems, ranging from transcriptional practices to document 
management  to  authenticity.  And  they  offer  a  wealth  of 
information  to  editors  working  on  various  types  of  digital 
editions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In this paper, I consider an editorial problem that has yet to be 
resolved.  My  discussion  centers  on  the  difﬁ culties  that  arise 
in  editing  a  single,  albeit  somewhat  unusual,  Icelandic  saga: 
Hafgeirs saga Flateyings. This saga is preserved in an unsigned, 
eighteenth-century  manuscript, Additamenta  6,  folio  (Add.  6, 
fol.). Today  housed  in  the  collection  of  the Arni  Magnusson 
Institute  for  Icelandic  Studies  in  Reykjavík,  Iceland,  the 
manuscript  was  originally  held  as  part  of  the Arnamagnæan 
Collection in Copenhagen, Denmark. According to the ﬂ yleaf: 
“Saga  af  Hafgeyre  ﬂ ateying  udskreven  af  en  Membran  der 
kommen er fra Island 1774 in 4to exarata Seculo xij” (Hafgeirs 
saga  Flayetings  was  copied  from  a  twelfth-century  manuscript 
written in quarto, which came [to Copenhagen] from Iceland in 
1774).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While  such  a  manuscript  might  appear  unremarkable,  as  a 
number  of  paper  manuscripts  were  copied  during  the  late 
eighteenth century in Copenhagen, then the capital of Iceland 
and the seat of Icelandic manuscript transmission during this 
period,  only  twelve  Old  Norse/Old  Icelandic  manuscripts  of 
those catalogued in the Copenhagen collections are dated to 
the twelfth century, while a mere eighteen are dated to 1200 
(Kalund 512). The dating on the ﬂ yleaf is therefore unusual, and 
as it turns out, suspect as well, since no catalog entry exists 
to  record  the  existence  of  the  alleged  source  manuscript. 
Moreover, according to Jorgensen, the motif sequences found in 
Hafgeirs saga bear a striking resemblance to those found in the 
well-known  mythical-heroic  saga  Hálfdanars  saga  Brönufóstra 
(157). And  in  a  fascinating  argument  based  primarily  on  this 
fact, Jorgensen argues that Add. 6, fol. is a forgery, claiming that 
Þorlákur Magnússon Ísﬁ ord, an Icelandic student studying and 
working in Copenhagen during the 1780s, composed and sold 
Hafgeirs saga as a copy of an authentic medieval Icelandic saga 
(163).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Scholarly Editions” Section 1.1) electronic edition of the text 
and  the  manuscript.  But  the  question,  at  least  until  recently, 
was  how? What  is  the  best  way  to  represent  such  a  text? 
Encoding  the  work  according  to  a  markup  standard  such 
as the TEI Guidelines is surely a starting point, but doing so 
doesn’t solve one of the primary concerns: How to represent 
the  manuscript  reliably  (which  presents  a  complex  editorial 
problem of its own), while at the same time illuminating the 
textual and linguistic ‘artefacts’ that may offer readers insight 
into the saga’s origin?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At  the  2007  Digital  Humanities  Summer  Institute,  Matthew 
Driscoll gave a talk entitled “Everything But the Smell: Toward 
a More Artefactual Digital Philology.” The talk provided a brief 
history  of  the  shift  toward ‘new’  philology,  and,  importantly, 
underscored  the  signiﬁ cance  of  the  material  or ‘artefactual’ 
aspect of new philology, which views manuscripts as physical 
objects and thus as cultural artefacts which offer insight into 
the “process to which they are witness” (“Everything But the 
Smell: Toward a More Artefactual Digital Philology”). The TEI, 
Driscoll pointed out, offers support for artefactual philology, and 
the descriptive framework of the P5 Guidelines, which deﬁ nes 
Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the underlying encoding 
language, is ideal for this kind of work. Moreover, as Driscoll 
suggests, there is “no limit to the information one can add to 
a text - apart, that is, from the limits of our own imagination” 
(“Electronic Textual  Editing:  Levels  of Transcription”). To  be 
sure, this paper does not lapse into what McCarty refers to 
as the ‘complete encoding fallacy’ or the ‘mimetic fallacy’ (see 
Dahlström 24), but it does agree with Driscoll in arguing that 
P5-conformant editions, which can offer a signiﬁ cant layering 
of data and metadata, have the potential to move the reader 
beyond the aesthetics of sensory experience.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>By  deﬁ nition,  artefactual  philology  portends  a  kind  of 
‘evidentiary’  approach,  one  that  can  frame  textual  features, 
including linguistic and non-linguistic features (such as lacunae) 
for  example,  as  kinds  of  evidence.  Evidence  of  what? That  is 
in the hands of the editors and the readers, but conceivably: 
linguistic development, the transmission process, literary merit, 
and so on. And when an evidentiary approach to philology is 
deﬁ ned  within  a ‘generative’  approach  to  a  scholarly  edition 
(see  Vanhoutte’s  “Generating”  164),  a  new  direction  in 
electronic editing becomes possible.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  paper  explores  this  new  direction.  It  shows  how  the 
Hafgeirs  saga  edition  employs  such  a  framework  to  address 
the problem of describing linguistic and non-linguistic artefacts, 
which are precisely the kinds of evidence that can bear witness 
to  the  composition  date  and  transmission  process.  And  it 
demonstrates how the display decisions result in an interactive 
and dynamic experience for the edition’s readers.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  spite  of  its  questionable  origin,  Hafgeirs  saga  stands  as  a 
remnant of Iceland’s literary, linguistic, and textual history, and 
Add. 6, fol. can therefore be viewed as an important cultural 
artefact. As  the  editor  of  the  Hafgeirs  saga  manuscript,  my 
aim  is  to  provide  a ‘reliable’  (see “Guidelines  for  Editors  of

in  evaluating  the  saga’s  composition  date.  Given  the  ‘logic

described  in  the  new  elements  beside  the  descriptive  data 
described by pre-deﬁ ned elements (such as <del> for example) 
can be accomplished without sacriﬁ cing the role of the text as 
a literary and cultural artefact. Because the transformation of 
the source XML has been designed to display interactively the 
various encodings of the text2, readers can view or suppress the 
various descriptions and generate their own novel versions of 
the text. Readers can display archaisms, for instance, and assess 
whether they are “affectation[s] of spurious age” (Einar 39) or 
features consistent with the textual transmission process, and 
they  can  view  borrowings,  for  instance,  and  assess  whether 
they  preclude  a  medieval  origin  or  are  to  be  expected  in  a 
text ostensibly copied by a scribe living in Copenhagen during 
the eighteenth century. Or they can suppress these features 
and  view  the  normalized  transcription,  the  semi-diplomatic 
transcription,  emendations,  editorial  comments,  or  any 
combination of these.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Ultimately,  this  paper  synthesizes  aspects  of  text  editing, 
philology, and linguistics to explore a new direction in digital 
editing. In doing so, it frames P5 XML as a kind of luminol that, 
when  transformed,  can  be  used  to  illuminate  new  types  of 
evidence: linguistic and philological data. And the goal is identical 
to that of a crime-scene investigator’s: Not necessarily to solve 
the case, but to preserve and to present the evidence.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Notes
[1] The  <borrowing>  element  describes  a  non-native  word  which 
has  been  adopted  into  the  language.  Distinct  from  the  <foreign> 
element, a borrowing may have the following attributes: @sourcelang 
(source language), @borrowdate (date of borrowing), @borrowtype 
(type  of  borrowing;  e.g.  calque,  loanword).  The  <modernism> 
element  describes  a  word,  phrase,  usage,  or  peculiarity  of  style 
which represents an innovative or distinctively modern feature. The 
<neologism> element describes a word or phrase which is new to 
the language or one which has been recently coined. The <archaism> 
element describes an archaic morphological, phonological, or syntactic 
feature or an archaic word, phrase, expression, etc.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>If,  until  the  middle  of  the  nineties,  the  main  preoccupation 
of  the  scholarly  editor  had  been  that  of  conserving  as 
faithfully as possible the information contained in the original 
sources,  in  the  last  ten  years  attention  has  shifted  to  the 
user’s  participation  in  the  production  of  web  content. This 
development  has  occurred  under  pressure  from  the ‘native’ 
forms of digital communication as characterised by the term 
‘Web 2.0’ (Tapscott and Williams, 2006). We are interested in 
harnessing the collaborative power of these new environments 
to create ‘ﬂ uid, co-operative, distributed’ (Robinson 2007: 10) 
digital versions of our textual cultural heritage. The approach 
taken  by  Hypernietzsche  (Barbera,  2007)  similarly  tries  to 
foster collaboration around cultural heritage texts. However, 
while  Hypernietzsche  focuses  on  annotation,  what  we  have 
developed is a wiki-inspired environment for documents that 
were  previously  considered  too  complex  for  this  kind  of 
editing. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Before explaining how this can work in practice, it is worthwhile 
to  reﬂ ect  on  why  it  is  necessary  to  change  our  means  of 
editing cultural heritage texts. G.T. Tanselle has recently argued 
(2006) that in the digital medium ‘we still have to confront the 
same  issues  that  editors  have  struggled  with  for  twenty-ﬁ ve 
hundred  years’. That  may  be  true  for  analysis  of  the  source 
texts  themselves,  but  digitisation  does  change  fundamentally 
both the objectives of editing and the function of the edition. 
For the representation of a text ‘is conditioned by the modes 
of  its  production  and  reproduction’  (Segre,  1981). The  well-
known editorial method of Lachmann, developed for classical 
texts, and that of the New Bibliography for early printed books, 
both assumed that the text was inherently corrupt and needed 
correction  into  the  single  version  of  a  print  edition. With 
the  advent  of  the  digital  medium  textual  critics ‘discovered 
that  texts  were  more  than  simply  correct  or  erroneous’ 
(Shillingsburg, 2006: 81). The possibility of representing multiple 
versions or multiple markup perspectives has long been seen 
as an enticing prospect of the digital medium, but attempts to 
achieve this so far have led either to complexity that taxes the 
limitations of markup (Renear, 1997: 121) or to an overload of 
information  and  a ‘drowning  by  versions’  (Dalhstrom,  2000). 
It is now generally recognised that written texts can contain 
complexities and subtleties of structure that defeat the power 
of markup alone to represent them (Buzzetti, 2002).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In our talk we would like to present three examples of how 
overlapping  structures  can  be  efﬁ ciently  edited  in  a  wiki:  of 
a modern genetic text in Italian, of a short classical text, the 
‘Sybilline  Gospel’,  and  of  a  short  literary  text  marked  up  in 
various ways. Our purpose is to demonstrate the ﬂ exibility of 
the tool and the generality of the underlying algorithm, which 
is not designed for any one type of text or any one type of 
editing.  However,  because  of  the  limited  space,  we  will  only 
describe here the Sibylline Gospel text. This is a particularly 
interesting  example,  because  it  not  only  has  a  complex 
manuscript tradition but it has also been deliberately altered 
throughout its history like agenetic text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Sibylla Tiburtina is an apocalyptic prophecy that describes 
the nine ages of world history up to the Last Judgement. The 
ﬁ rst version of this prophecy, which enjoyed a widespread and 
lasting  popularity  throughout  the  whole  medieval  era,  was 
written in Greek in the second half of the 4th century. Of this 
lost text we have an edited Byzantine version, dating from the 
beginning of the 6th century, and several Latin versions, besides 
translations in Old French and German, in oriental languages 
(Syric, Arabic and Ethiopian) and in Slavic and Romanian.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  known  Latin  manuscripts  number  approximately  100, 
ranging  in  date  from  the  mid  11th  century  to  the  beginning 
of the 16th. In the course of these centuries, with a particular 
concentration between the 11th and 12th centuries, the text 
was  subjected  to  continuous  revisions,  in  order  to  adapt  it. 
This is demonstrated both by the changing names of eastern 
rulers mentioned in the ninth age, which involves the coming 
of  a  Last  Roman  Emperor  and  of  the Antichrist,  and  by  the 
introduction of more strictly theological aspects, especially in 
the so-called ‘Sibylline Gospel’, that is an account of Christ’s 
life  presented  by  the  Sibyl  under  the  fourth  age.  No  critical 
edition of the Sibylla Tiburtina based on all its Latin versions 
has yet been produced, although this is the only way to unravel 
the  genesis  of  the  text  and  the  history  of  its  successive 
reworkings. A classical type of critical edition, however, would 
not  be  appropriate,  nor  would  it  make  sense,  to  establish  a 
critical  text  in  the  traditional  sense  as  one ‘cleaned  of  the 
errors accumulated in the course of its history and presented 
in  a  form  most  closely  imagined  to  have  been  the  original’. 
With this kind of representation one would have on the one 
hand the inconvenience of an unwieldy apparatus criticus and 
on the other, the serious inconsistency of a ‘critical’ text that 
never had any real existence.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  handle  cases  like  this,  we  are  well  advanced  in  the 
development  of  a  multi-version  document  wiki  application. 
The  multi-version  document  (or  MVD)  concept  is  a  further 
development of the variant graph model described at Digital 
Humanities  2006  and  elsewhere  (Schmidt  and  Fiormonte, 
2007).  In  a  nutshell  the  MVD  format  stores  the  text  as  a 
graph that accurately represents a single work in digital form, 
however  many  versions  or  markup  perspectives  it  may  be 
composed of. An MVD ﬁ le is no mere aggregation of separate 
ﬁ les; it is a single digital entity, within which versions may be 
efﬁ ciently searched and compared. It consists of three parts:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1) The variant-graph consisting of a list of the differences 
between the versions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2) A description of each of the versions, including a short 
name or siglum, e.g. ‘L10’, a longer name e.g. ‘London, Brit. 
Lib. Cotton Titus D.III, saec. XIII’ and a group name.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3) A list of groups. A group is a name for a group of versions 
or other groups. For example, in the Sybilline Gospel 
text there are three recensions, to which each of the 
manuscripts belong. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The wiki application consists of two JAVA packages (outlined 
in bold):
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  application  is  suitable  for  collaborative  reﬁ nement  of 
texts within a small group of researchers or by a wider public, 
and attempts to extend the idea of the wiki to new classes of 
text and to new classes of user.

Humanities Tools

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Tool  development  in  the  Digital  Humanities  has  been  the 
subject  of  numerous  articles  and  conference  presentations 
(Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), 2006; Bradley, 
2003;  McCarty,  2005;  McGann,  2005;  Ramsay,  2003,  2005; 
Schreibman, Hanlon, Daugherty, Ross, 2007; Schreibman, Kumar, 
McDonald, 2003; Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities, 
2005;  Unsworth,  2003). While  the  purpose  and  direction  of 
tools  and  tool  development  for  the  Digital  Humanities  has 
been discussed and debated in those forums, the value of tool 
development  itself  has  seen  little  discussion. This  is  in  part 
because tools are developed to aid and abet scholarship – they 
are  not  necessarily  considered  scholarship  themselves. That 
perception may be changing, though. The clearest example of 
such a shift in thinking came from the recent recommendations 
of the ACLS Commission on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities 
and  Social  Sciences,  which  called  not  only  for  “policies  for 
tenure  and  promotion  that  recognize  and  reward  digital 
scholarship and scholarly communication” but likewise stated 
that “recognition should be given not only to scholarship that 
uses the humanities and social science cyberinfrastructure but 
also to scholarship that contributes to its design, construction 
and growth.” On the other hand, the MLA Report on Evaluating 
Scholarship  for Tenure  and  Promotion  found  that  a  majority  of 
departments have little to no experience evaluating refereed 
articles and monographs in electronic format. The prospects 
for  evaluating  tool  development  as  scholarship  in  those 
departments  would  appear  dim.  However,  coupled  with  the 
more optimistic recommendations of the ACLS report, as well 
the  MLA  Report’s  ﬁ ndings  that  evaluation  of  work  in  digital 
form is gaining ground in some departments, the notion of tool 
development as a scholarly activity may not be far behind.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  2005,  scholars  from  the  humanities  as  well  as  the  social 
sciences and computer science met in Charlottesville, Virginia 
for a Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities. While the summit 
itself focused primarily on the use of digital resources and digital 
tools for scholarship, the Report on Summit Accomplishments 
that followed touched on development, concluding that “the 
development of tools for the interpretation of digital evidence 
is itself research in the arts and humanities.” 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>development community and as developers perceive how their 
home institutions and the community for which the software 
was developed value their work. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The data for this paper will be drawn from two sources. The 
ﬁ rst source is a survey carried out by the authors in 2007 on 
The Versioning  Machine,  the  results  of  which  were  shared  at 
a poster session at the 2007 Digital Humanities Conference. 
The results of this survey were intriguing, particularly in the 
area of the value of The Versioning Machine as a tool in which 
the vast majority of respondents found it valuable as a means 
to advance scholarship in spite of the fact that they themselves 
did  not  use  it. As  a  result  of  feedback  by  the  community  to 
that poster session, the authors decided to conduct a focused 
survey on tool development as a scholarly activity. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>After taking advice from several prominent Digital Humanities 
tool  developers,  the  survey  has  been  completed  and  will  be 
issued  in  December  to  gather  information  on  how  faculty, 
programmers,  web  developers,  and  others  working  in  the 
Digital  Humanities  perceive  the  value  and  purpose  of  their 
software and digital tool development activities. This paper will 
report  the  ﬁ ndings  of  a  web-based  survey  that  investigates 
how tools have been conceived, executed, received and used 
by  the  community.  Additionally,  the  survey  will  investigate 
developers’ perceptions of how tool development is valued in 
the academic community, both as a contribution to scholarship 
in  their  particular  ﬁ elds,  and  in  relation  to  requirements  for 
tenure and promotion.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The authors will use these surveys to take up John Unsworth’s 
challenge, made at the 2007 Digital Humanities Centers Summit 
“to  make  our  difﬁ culties,  the  shortcomings  of  our  tools, 
the  challenges  we  haven’t  yet  overcome,  something  that  we 
actually  talk  about,  analyze,  and  explicitly  learn  from.”    By 
examining not only how developers perceive their work, but 
how  practitioners  in  the  ﬁ eld  use  and  value  their  tools,  we 
intend to illuminate the role of tool development in the Digital 
Humanities and in the larger world of academia.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Popular  methods  for  cultural  heritage  digitization  include 
ﬂ atbed  scanning  and  high-resolution  photography.  The 
current  paradigm  for  the  digitization  and  dissemination  of 
library  collections  is  to  create  high-resolution  digital  images 
as  facsimiles  of  primary  source  materials.  While  these 
approaches have provided new levels of accessibility to many 
cultural artifacts, they usually assume that the object is more 
or less ﬂ at, or at least viewable in two dimensions. However, 
this assumption is simply not true for many cultural heritage 
objects.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For several years, researchers have been exploring digitization 
of documents beyond 2D imaging. Three-dimensional surface 
acquisition  technology  has  been  used  to  capture  the  shape 
of  non-planar  texts  and  build  3D  document  models  (Brown 
2000,  Landon  2006),  where  structured  light  techniques  are 
used  to  acquire  3D  surface  geometry  and  a  high-resolution 
still camera is used to capture a 2D texture image.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>However,  there  are  many  documents  that  are  impossible  to 
scan  or  photograph  in  the  usual  way. Take  for  example  the 
entirety of the British Library’s Cotton Collection, which was 
damaged  by  a  ﬁ re  in  1731  (Tite  1994,  Prescott  1997,  Seales 
2000, Seales 2004). Following the ﬁ re most of the manuscripts 
in this collection suffered from both ﬁ re and water damage, 
and  had  to  be  physically  dismantled  and  then  painstakingly 
reassembled. Another  example  is  the  collection  of  papyrus 
scrolls that are in the Egyptian papyrus collection at the British 
Museum (Smith 1987, Andrews 1990, Lapp 1997). Because of 
damage to the outer shells of some of these scrolls the text 
enclosed therein have never been read - unrolling the fragile 
material would destroy them.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Certain objects can be physically repaired prior to digitization. 
However,  the  fact  is  that  many  items  are  simply  too  fragile 
to sustain physical restoration. As long as physical restoration 
is  the  only  option  for  opening  such  opaque  documents, 
scholarship has to sacriﬁ ce for preservation, or preservation 
sacriﬁ ce for scholarship.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  famous  Herculaneum  collection  is  an  outstanding 
example  of  the  scholarship/preservation  dichotomy  (Sider 
2005). In the 1750s, the excavation of more than a thousand 
scorched  papyrus  rolls  from  the Villa  dei  Papiri  (the Villa  of 
the Papyri) in ancient Herculaneum caused great excitement 
among  contemporary  scholars,  for  they  held  the  possibility

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>of  the  rediscovery  of  lost  masterpieces  by  classical  writers. 
However, as a result of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79 
that destroyed Pompeii and also buried nearby Herculaneum, 
the papyrus rolls were charred severely and are now extremely 
brittle, frustrating attempts to open them.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>they contain any writing at all. We tested this manuscript using 
methods that we had reﬁ ned over a series of simulations and 
real-world experiments, but this experiment was our ﬁ rst on 
a bona ﬁ de primary source.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A number of approaches have been devised to physically open 
the  rolls,  varying  from  mechanical  and “caloric”,  to  chemical 
(Sider 2005). Substrate breakages caused during the opening 
create  incomplete  letters  that  appear  in  several  separate 
segments, which makes reading them very difﬁ cult. Some efforts 
have been made to reconstruct the scrolls, including tasks such 
as establishing the relative order of fragments and assigning to 
them  an  absolute  sequence  (Janko  2003).  In  addition,  multi-
spectral analysis and conventional image processing methods 
have  helped  to  reveal  signiﬁ cant  previously  unknown  texts. 
All in all, although these attempts have introduced some new 
works to the canon, they have done so at the expense of the 
physical objects holding the text.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Given the huge amount of labor and care it takes to physically 
unroll the scrolls, together with the risk of destruction caused 
by the unrolling, a technology capable of producing a readable 
image of a rolled-up text without the need to physically open 
it  is  an  attractive  concept. Virtual  unrolling  would  offer  an 
obvious and substantial payoff.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  summary,  there  is  a  class  of  objects  that  are  inaccessible 
due to their physical construction. Many of these objects may 
carry precise contents which will remain a mystery unless and 
until  they  are  opened.  In  most  cases,  physical  restoration  is 
not an option because it is too risky, unpredictable, and labor 
intensive.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  dilemma  is  well  suited  for  advanced  computer  vision 
techniques to provide a safe and efﬁ cient solution. The EDUCE 
project (Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and 
Exploration)  is  developing  a  general  restoration  approach 
that  enables  access  to  those  impenetrable  objects  without 
the  need  to  open  them.  The  vision  is  to  apply  this  work 
ultimately to documents such as those described above, and 
to allow complete analysis while enforcing continued physical 
preservation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Proof of Concept
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>With the assistance of curators from the Special Collections 
Library at the University of Michigan, we were given access to 
a manuscript from the 15th century that had been dismantled 
and  used  in  the  binding  of  a  printed  book  soon  after  its 
creation. The manuscript is located in the spine of the binding, 
and consists of seven or so layers that were stuck together, 
as shown in ﬁ gure 1. The handwritten text on the top layer is 
recognizable from the book of Ecclesiastes. The two columns of 
texts correspond to Eccl 2:4/2:5 (2:4 word 5 through 2:5 word 
6) and Eccl 2:10 (word 10.5 through word 16). However, it was 
not clear what writing appears on the inner layers, or whether 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1: Spine from a binding made of 
a ﬁ fteenth-century manuscript.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Following procedures which will be discussed in more detail 
in our presentation, we were able to bring out several layers 
of text, including the text on the back of the top layer. Figure 2 
shows the result generated by our method to reveal the back 
side of the top layer which is glued inside and inaccessible. The 
left and right columns were identiﬁ ed as Eccl. 1:16 and 1:11 
respectively.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  verify  our  ﬁ ndings,  conservation  specialists  at  the 
University  of  Michigan  uncovered  the  back  side  of  the  top 
layer by removing the ﬁ rst layer from the rest of the strip of 
manuscript. The process was painstaking, in order to minimize 
damage, and it took an entire day. First, the strip was soaked in 
water for a couple of hours to dissolve the glue and enhance 
the ﬂ exibility of the material which was fragile due to age; this 
added a risk of the ink dissolving, although the duration and 
water  temperature  were  controlled  to  protect  against  this 
happening. Then, the ﬁ rst layer was carefully pulled apart from 
the  rest  of  the  manuscript  with  tweezers. The  process  was 
very slow to avoid tearing the material. Remaining residue was 
scraped off gently.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The back side of the top layer is shown in ﬁ gure 3. Most of 
the Hebrew characters in the images are legible and align well 
with those in the digital images of the manuscript. The middle 
rows show better results than the rows on the edges. That is 
because the edge areas were damaged in structure, torn and 
abraded, and that degraded the quality of the restoration.

the top layer, identiﬁ ed as Eccl. 1:16 and 1:11.

University  of  Kentucky  to  undergo  testing  following  similar 
procedures  to  those  that  resulted  in  the  uncovering  of  the

the British Museum scanning and virtually unrolling examples 
from their collections of papyrus scrolls. This presentation at 
Digital  Humanities  2008  will  serve  not  only  as  an  overview 
of  the  techniques  that  led  to  the  successful  test  described 
above, but will also be an extremely up-to-date report of the 
most recent work of the project. We look forward to breaking 
down  the  dichotomy  between  preservation  and  scholarship 
for this particular class of delicate objects.

Research Teams in Digital

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  proposal  reports  on  a  research  project  exploring  the 
nature of research teams in the Digital Humanities community. 
It is a start to understanding the type of supports and research 
preparation  that  individuals  within  the  ﬁ eld  require  to 
successfully collaborate within research teams.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Context
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Traditionally,  research  contributions  in  the  humanities  ﬁ eld 
have  been  felt  to  be,  and  documented  to  be,  predominantly 
solo efforts by academics involving little direct collaboration 
with  others,  a  model  reinforced  through  doctoral  studies 
and beyond (See, for example, Cuneo, 2003; Newell & Swan, 
2000). However, Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities is 
an exception to this. Given that the nature of research work 
involves computers and a variety of skills and expertise, Digital 
Humanities  researchers  are  working  collaboratively  within 
their institutions and with others nationally and internationallly 
to undertake the research. This research typically involves the 
need to coordinate efforts between academics, undergraduate 
and  graduate  students,  research  assistants,  computer 
programmers,  librarians,  and  other  individuals  as  well  as  the 
need to coordinate ﬁ nancial and other resources. Despite this, 
there  has  been  little  formal  research  on  team  development 
within this community.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>That  said,  efforts  toward  understanding  the  organizational 
context  in  which  Digital  Humanites  research  is  situated  is 
beginning in earnest. Two large-scale survey projects (Siemens 
et  al.,  2002;  Toms  et  al.,  2004)  have  highlighted  issues  of 
collaboration, among other topics, and Warwick (2004) found 
that the organizational context has had an impact on the manner 
in  which  Digital  Humanities/Humanities  Computing  centres 
developed  in  the  United  States  and  England.  Other  studies 
are underway as well. In addition, McCarty (2005b) explores 
the ways that computers have opened the opportunities for 
collaboration  within  the  humanities  and  has  explored  the 
associated challenges of collaboration and team research within 
the HUMANIST listserve (2005a). Finally, through efforts such 
as  the  University  of Victoria’s  Digital  Humanities/Humanities 
Computing Summer Institute and other similar ventures, the 
community  is  working  to  develop  its  collaborative  capacity 
through workshops in topics like community-speciﬁ c project 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>management  skills,  which  also  includes  discussion  of  team 
development and support.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  study  draws  upon  these  efforts  as  it  explores  and 
documents  the  nature  of  research  teams  within  the  Digital 
Humanities  community  to  the  end  of  identifying  exemplary 
work  patterns  and  larger  models  of  research  collaboration 
that  have  the  potential  to  strengthen  this  positive  aspect  of 
the community even further.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Methods
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  project  uses  a  qualitative  research  approach  with  in-
depth interviews with members of various multi-disciplinary, 
multi-location project teams in Canada, the United States, and 
the  United  Kingdom. The  interview  questions  focus  on  the 
participants’ deﬁ nition of teams; their experiences working in 
teams;  and  the  types  of  supports  and  research  preparation 
required to ensure effective and efﬁ cient research results. The 
results  will  include  a  description  of  the  community’s  work 
patterns and relationships and the identiﬁ cation of supports 
and research preparation required to sustain research teams 
(as per Marshall & Rossman, 1999; McCracken, 1988).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Preliminary Findings
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At the time of writing this proposal, ﬁ nal data analysis is being 
completed,  but  clear  patterns  are  emerging  and,  after  ﬁ nal 
analysis, these will form the basis of my presentation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The individuals interviewed currently are and have been a part 
of a diverse set of team research projects, in terms of research 
objective,  team  membership  size,  budget,  and  geographical 
dispersion,  both  within  their  own  institution,  nationally,  and 
internationally.  The  roles  they  play  are  varied  and  include 
research assistant, researcher, computer programmer, and lead 
investigator.  There  are  several  commonalities  among  these 
individuals in terms of their skill development in team research 
and their deﬁ nition of research teams and communities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>When  ﬁ nal  data  analysis  is  complete,  a  series  of  exemplary 
patterns  and  models  of  research  collaboration  will  be 
identiﬁ ed and outlined. These patterns and models will include 
the identiﬁ cation of supports and research preparation which 
can sustain research teams in the present and into the future.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  beneﬁ ts  to  the  Digital  Humanities  community  will  be 
several. First, the study contributes to an explicit description 
of the community’s work patterns and relationships. Second, it 
also builds on previous efforts to understand the organizational 
context  in  which  Digital  Humanities/Humanities  Computing 
centres  operate  in  order  to  place  focus  on  the  role  of  the 
individual  and  teams  in  research  success.  Finally,  it  identiﬁ es 
possible supports and research preparation to aid the further 
development of successful research teams.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Doing Digital Scholarship
Lisa Spiro
lspiro@rice.edu
Rice University, USA
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>When 
I  completed  my  dissertation  Bachelors  of  Arts: 
Bachelorhood and the Construction of Literary Identity in Antebellum 
America in 2002, I ﬁ gured that I was ahead of most of my peers 
in  my  use  of  digital  resources,  but  I  made  no  pretense  of 
doing digital scholarship. I plumbed electronic text collections 
such  as  Making  of America  and  Early American  Fiction  for 
references  to  bachelorhood,  and  I  used  simple  text  analysis 
tools to count the number of times words such as “bachelor” 
appeared  in  key  texts.  I  even  built  an  online  critical  edition 
of a section from Reveries of a Bachelor (http://etext.virginia.
edu/users/spiro/Contents2.html),  one  of  the  central  texts  of 
sentimental bachelorhood. But in my determination to ﬁ nish 
my PhD before gathering too many more gray hairs, I resisted 
the impulse to use more sophisticated analytical tools or to 
publish my dissertation online.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Five years later, the possibilities for digital scholarship in the 
humanities have grown. Projects such as TAPOR, Token-X, and 
MONK are constructing sophisticated tools for text analysis 
and  visualization.  Massive  text  digitization  projects  such  as 
Google  Books  and  the  Open  Content Alliance  are  making 
it  possible  to  search  thousands  (if  not  millions)  of  books. 
NINES and other initiatives are building communities of digital 
humanities  scholars,  portals  to  content,  and  mechanisms  for 
conducting  peer  review  of  digital  scholarship. To  encourage 
digital  scholarship,  the  NEH  recently  launched  a  funding 
program. Meanwhile, scholars are blogging, putting up videos 
on YouTube, and using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Despite  this  growth  in  digital  scholarship,  there  are  still  too 
few  examples  of  innovative  projects  that  employ  “digital 
collections  and  analytical  tools  to  generate  new  intellectual 
products”  (ACLS  7).  As  reports  such  as  A  Kaleidoscope  of 
American  Literature  and  Our  Cultural  Commonwealth  suggest, 
the  paucity  of  digital  scholarship  results  from  the  lack  of 
appropriate tools, technical skills, funding, and recognition. In a 
study of Dickinson, Whitman and Uncle Tom’s Cabin scholars, 
my  colleague  Jane  Segal  and  I  found  that  although  scholars 
are increasingly using digital resources in their research, they 
are  essentially  employing  them  to  make  traditional  research 
practices  more  efﬁ cient  and  gain  access  to  more  resources, 
not  (yet)  to  transform  their  research  methodology  by 
employing  new  tools  and  processes  (http://library.rice.edu/
services/digital_media_center/projects/the-impact-of-digital-
resources-on-humanities-research). What does it mean to do 
humanities research in a Web 2.0 world? To what extent do 
existing tools, resources, and research methods support digital 
scholarship, and what else do scholars need?

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To investigate these questions, I am revisiting my dissertation 
to re-imagine and re-mix it as digital scholarship. I aim not only 
to open up new insights into my primary research area--the 
signiﬁ cance of bachelorhood in nineteenth-century American 
culture--but also to document and analyze emerging methods 
for conducting research in the digital environment.  To what 
extent do digital tools and resources enable new approaches 
to  traditional  research  questions—and  to  what  extent  are 
entirely new research questions and methods enabled?  I am 
structuring  my  research  around  what  John  Unsworth  calls 
the “scholarly  primitives,”  or  core  research  practices  in  the 
humanities:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. Discovering: To determine how much information 
is available online, I have searched for the nearly 300 
resources cited in my dissertation in Google Books, Making 
of America, and other web sites. I found that 77% of my 
primary source resources and 22% of my secondary sources 
are available online as full-text, while 92% of all my research 
materials have been digitized (this number includes works 
available through Google Books as limited preview, snippet 
view, and no preview.)  Although most nineteenth-century 
books cited in my dissertation are now freely available 
online, many archival resources and periodicals have not yet 
been digitized. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. Annotating: In the past, I kept research notes in long, 
unwieldy Word documents, which made it hard to ﬁ nd 
information that I needed. New software such as Zotero 
enables researchers to store copies of the digital resources 
and to make annotations as part of the metadata record. 
What effect does the ability to share and annotate 
resources have on research practices? How useful is tagging 
as a mechanism for organizing information?  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. Comparing: Through text analysis and collation software 
such as Juxta and TAPOR, scholars can compare different 
versions of texts and detect patterns. Likewise, the Virtual 
Lightbox allows researchers to compare and manipulate 
digital images. What kind of new insights can be generated 
by using these tools? In the course of doing my research, 
I am testing freely available tools and evaluating their 
usefulness for my project.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. Referring: With digital publications, we not only can refer 
to prior work, but link to it, even embed it. What is the 
best means for constructing a scholarly apparatus in digital 
scholarship, particularly in a work focused not only on 
making an argument, but also on examining the process that 
shaped that argument? 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>5. Sampling: With so much information available, what 
criteria should we use to determine what to focus on? 
Since not everything is digitized and search engines can be 
blunt instruments, what do we ignore by relying mainly on 
digital resources? In my blog, I am reﬂ ecting on the selection 
criteria used to produce the arguments in my revamped 
dissertation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>6. Illustrating: What kind of evidence do we use to build 
an argument in a work of digital scholarship, and how is that 
evidence presented? In my dissertation, I generalized about 
the signiﬁ cance of bachelorhood in American literature by 
performing close readings of a few key texts, but such a 
method was admittedly unsystematic. By using text analysis 
tools to study a much larger sample of primary texts, I 
can cite statistics such as word frequency in making my 
argument--but does this make my argument any more 
convincing?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>7. Representing: How should a work of digital scholarship 
be presented? Ideally readers would be able to examine 
the evidence for themselves and even perform their 
own queries. At the same time, information should be 
offered so that it is clear and consistent with familiar 
academic discourse. How should I make available not 
only research conclusions, but also the detailed research 
process that undergirds these conclusions--the successful 
and unsuccessful searches, the queries run in text analysis 
software, the insights offered by collaborators? How will 
the digital work compare to the more traditional original 
dissertation? What kind of tools (for instance, ifBook’s 
Sophie) will be used to author the work?
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In addition to Unsworth’s list, I offer two more:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>8. Collaborating: Although humanities scholars are thought 
to be solitary, they collaborate frequently by exchanging 
bibliographic references and drafts of their essays. How do 
I engage the community in my research? I am encouraging 
others to comment on my (re-) work in progress (http://
digitalhumanities.edublogs.org/) using Comment Press. 
Moreover, I am bookmarking all web-based sources for 
my study on delicious (http://del.icio.us/lms4w/digital_
scholarship) and making available feeds from my various 
research sources through a PageFlakes portal (http://www.
pageﬂ akes.com/lspiro/). On my blog, “Digital Scholarship 
in the Humanities,” I explore issues and ideas raised by 
my research (http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/).  I 
am examining what it takes to build an audience and how 
visibility and collaboration affect my research practices.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>9. Remixing: What would it mean to take an earlier 
work--my own dissertation, for example--use new sources 
and approaches, and present it in a new form? What 
constitutes a scholarly remix, and what are the implications 
for intellectual property and academic ethics? I also plan 
to experiment with mashups as a means of generating and 
presenting new insights, such as a Google Map plotting 
census statistics about antebellum bachelors or a visual 
mashup of images of bachelors.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This project examines the process of doing research digitally, 
the capabilities and limits of existing tools and resources, and 
the  best  means  of  authoring,  representing  and  disseminating 
digital scholarship. I aim to make this process as open, visible, 
and  collaborative  as  possible.    My  presentation  will  focus

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Extracting author-speciﬁ c 
expressions using random 
forest for use in the 
sociolinguistic analysis of 
political speeches
Takafumi Suzuki

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  study  applies  stylistic  text  classiﬁ cation  using  random 
forest  to  extract  author-speciﬁ c  expressions  for  use  in  the 
sociolinguistic  analysis  of  political  speeches.  In  the  ﬁ eld  of 
politics, the style of political leaders’ speeches, as well as their 
content, has attracted growing attention in both English (Ahren, 
2005) and Japanese (Azuma, 2006; Suzuki and Kageura, 2006). 
One  of  the  main  purposes  of  these  studies  is  to  investigate 
political leaders’ individual and political styles by analyzing their 
speech  styles. A  common  problem  of  many  of  these  studies 
and  also  many  sociolinguistic  studies  is  that  the  expressions 
that  are  analyzed  are  selected  solely  on  the  basis  of  the 
researcher’s  interests  or  preferences,  which  can  sometimes 
lead  to  contradictory  interpretations.  In  other  words,  it  is 
difﬁ cult  to  determine  whether  these  kind  of  analyses  have 
in fact correctly identiﬁ ed political leaders’ individual speech 
styles and, on this basis, correctly characterised their individual 
and political styles. Another problem is that political leaders’ 
speech styles may also be characterised by the infrequent use 
of speciﬁ c expressions, but this is rarely focused on.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In order to solve these problems, we decided to apply stylistic 
text classiﬁ cation and feature extraction using random forest 
to  political  speeches.  By  classifying  the  texts  of  an  author 
according to their style and extracting the variables contributing 
to this classiﬁ cation, we can identify the expressions speciﬁ c 
to  that  author. This  enables  us  to  determine  his/her  speech 
style, including the infrequent use of speciﬁ c expressions, and 
characterise his/her individual and political style. This method 
can  be  used  for  the  sociolinguistic  analysis  of  various  types 
of  texts,  which  is,  according  to  Argamon  et  al.  (2007a),  a 
potentially important area of application for stylistics.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Experimental setup  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  selected  the  Diet  addresses  of  two  Japanese  prime 
ministers,  Nakasone  and  Koizumi,  and  performed  two 
classiﬁ cation  experiments:  we  distinguished  Nakasone’s 
addresses  from  those  of  his  3  contemporaries  (1980-1989), 
and Koizumi’s addresses from those of his 8 contemporaries 
(1989-2006).  Because  Nakasone  and  Koizumi  were  two  of 
the most powerful prime ministers in the history of Japanese 
politics, and took a special interest in the content or style of 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
196
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>their own speeches (Suzuki and Kageura, 2007), their addresses 
are the most appropriate candidates for initial analysis. Suzuki 
and  Kageura  (2006)  have  demonstrated  that  the  style  of 
Japanese prime ministers’ addresses has changed signiﬁ cantly 
over  time,  so  we  compared  their  addresses  with  those  of 
their  respective  contemporaries  selected  by  the  standard 
division of eras in Japanese political history. We downloaded 
the  addresses  from  the  online  database  Sekai  to  Nihon  (The 
World  and  Japan)  (www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~worldjpn),  and 
applied morphological analysis to the addresses using ChaSen 
(Matsumoto  et  al.,  2003). We  united  notational  differences 
which were distinguished only by kanji and kana in Japanese. 
Table 1 sets out the number of addresses and the total number 
of tokens and types for all words, particles and auxiliary verbs 
in each category.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Results and discussion  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Table 2 shows the precision, recall rates and F-values. Koizumi 
displayed  higher  accuracy  than  Nakasone,  partly  because  he 
had  a  more  individualistic  style  of  speech  (see  also  Figure  2 
and 3), and partly because a larger number of texts were used 
in his case. Many of the feature sets show high classiﬁ cation 
accuracy  (more  than  70%)  according  to  the  criteria  of  an 
analogous  study  (Argamon  et  al.,  2007c),  which  conﬁ rms 
the  high  performance  of  RF. The  results  also  show  that  the 
distribution of the auxiliary verbs and combinations can give 
better performance than that of the particles used in a previous 
study (Jin, 1997), and also that stemming and a deeper order of 
part-of-speech can improve the results.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Table 1. Basic data on the corpora
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>As a classiﬁ cation method, we selected the random forest (RF) 
method proposed by Breiman (2001), and evaluated the results 
using out-of-bag tests. RF is known to perform extremely well 
in  classiﬁ cation  tasks  in  other  ﬁ elds  using  large  amounts  of 
data, but to date few studies have used this method in the area 
of stylistics (Jin and Murakami, 2006). Our ﬁ rst aim in using RF 
was thus to test its effectiveness in stylistic text classiﬁ cation.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  second  and  more  important  aim  was  to  extract  the 
important  variables  contributing  to  classiﬁ cation  (which  are 
shown  as  high  Gini  coefﬁ cients).  The  extracted  variables 
represent  the  speciﬁ c  expressions  distinguishing  the  author 
from others, and they can show the author’s special preference 
or dislike for speciﬁ c expressions. Examining these extracted 
expressions enables us to determine the author’s speech style 
and  characterise  his/her  individual  and  political  styles.  In  an 
analogous  study, Argamon  et  al.  (2007b)  performed  gender-
based  classiﬁ cation  and  feature  extraction  using  SVM  and 
information gain, but as they are separate experiments and RF 
returns relevant variables contributing to classiﬁ cation, RF is 
more suitable for our purposes.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Table 2. Precisions and recall rates
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure  1  represents  the  top  twenty  variables  with  high  Gini 
coefﬁ cients according to the classiﬁ cation of combinations of 
features (2nd order and with stemming). The ﬁ gure indicates 
that several top variables had an especially important role in 
classiﬁ cation. In order to examine them in detail, we plotted in 
Figure 2 and 3 the transitions in the relative frequencies of the 
top four variables in the addresses of all prime ministers after 
World War 2. These include variables representing politeness 
(‘masu’,  ‘aru’,  ‘desu’),  assertion  (‘da’,  ‘desu’),  normativeness 
(‘beshi’), and intention (‘u’), and show the individual and political 
styles of these two prime ministers well. For example, ‘aru’ is 
a  typical  expression  used  in  formal  speeches,  and  also  Diet 
addresses (Azuma, 2006), and the fact that Koizumi used this 
expression more infrequently than any other prime minister 
indicates  his  approachable  speech  style  and  can  explain  his 
political success. Also, the ﬁ gure shows that we can extract the 
expressions that Nakasone and Koizumi used less frequently 
than  their  contemporaries  as  well  as  the  expressions  they 
used  frequently. These  results  show  the  effectiveness  of  RF 
feature  extraction  for  the  sociolinguistic  analysis  of  political 
speeches.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  decided  to  focus  on  the  distribution  of  particles  and 
auxiliary  verbs  because  they  represent  the  modality  of 
the  texts,  information  representing  authors’  personality 
and  sentiments  (Otsuka  et  al.,  2007),  and  are  regarded  as 
reﬂ ecting political leaders’ individual and political styles clearly 
in  Japanese  (Azuma,  2006,  Suzuki  and  Kageura,  2006).  We 
tested  8  distribution  combinations  as  features  (see Table  2). 
Though Jin (1997) has demonstrated that the distribution of 
particles (1st order part-of-speech tag) is a good indicator of 
the  author  in  Japanese,  the  performances  of  these  features, 
especially  auxiliary  verbs,  have  not  been  explored  fully,  and 
as the microscopic differences in features (order of part-of-
speech and stemming) can affect the classiﬁ cation accuracy, we 
decided to test the 8 combinations.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Gentleman in Dickens: A 
Multivariate Stylometric 
Approach to its Collocation
Tomoji Tabata

University of Osaka, Japan
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This study proposes a multivariate approach to the collocation 
of gentleman in Dickens. By applying a stylo-statistical analysis 
model based on correspondence analysis (Tabata, 2004, 2005, 
2007a,  and  2007b)  to  the  investigation  of  the  collocation 
of  the  word  gentleman,  the  present  study  visualizes  the 
complex  interrelationships  among  gentleman’s  collocates, 
interrelationships  among  texts,  and  the  association  patterns 
between  the  gentleman’s  collocates  and  texts  in  multi-
dimensional  spaces.  By  so  doing,  I  shall  illustrate  how  the 
collocational patterns of gentleman reﬂ ects a stylistic variation 
over time as well as the stylistic ﬁ ngerprint of the author.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One thing that strikes readers of Dickens in terms of his style 
is  the  ways  he  combines  words  together  (i.e.  collocation). 
Dickens sometimes combines words in a quite unique manner, 
in a way that contradicts our expectation to strike humour, to 
imply  irony  or  satire,  or  otherwise.  Dickens  also  uses  ﬁ xed/
repetitive collocations for characterization: to make particular 
characters memorable by making them stand out from others. 
The collocation of word gentleman, one of the most frequent 
‘content’ words in Dickens, is full of such examples, and would 
therefore be worthy of stylistic investigation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  signiﬁ cance  of  collocation  in  stylistic  studies  was  ﬁ rst 
suggested by J. R. Firth (1957) more than half a century ago. 
Thanks  to  the  efforts  by  Sinclair  (1991)  and  his  followers, 
who have developed empirical methodologies based on large-
scale  corpora,  the  study  of  collocation  has  become  widely 
acknowledged  as  an  important  area  of  linguistics.  However, 
the  vast  majority  of  collocation  studies  (Sinclair,  1991; 
Kjellmer,  1994;  Stubbs,  1995;  Hunston  and  Francis,  1999,  to 
name but a few) have been concerned with grammar/syntax, 
lexicography, and language pedagogy, not with stylistic aspects 
of collocation, by showing the company a word keeps. Notable 
exceptions are Louw (1993), Adolphs and Carter (2003), Hori 
(2004), and Partington (2006). The emergence of these recent 
studies seems to indicate that collocation is beginning to draw 
increasing attention from stylisticians. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>grammatical/syntactic, phraseological, and/or semantic relation 
between the node and its collocates. However, a conventional 
approach  would  not  be  suitable  if  one  wanted  to  explore 
whether the company a word keeps would remain unchanged, 
or its collocation would change over time or across texts. It 
is unsuitable because this would involve too many variables to 
process with a concordancer to include a diachronic or a cross-
textual/authorial  perspective  when  retrieving  collocational 
information from a large set of texts. Such an enterprise would 
require a multivariate approach.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Various  multivariate  analyses  of  texts  have  been  successful 
in  elucidating  linguistic  variation  over  time,  variation  across 
registers, variation across oceans, to say nothing of linguistic 
differences  between  authors  (Brainerd,  1980;  Burrows,  1987 
& 1996; Biber and Finegan, 1992; Craig, 1999a, b, & c; Hoover, 
2003a,  b,  &  c;  Rudman,  2005).  My  earlier  attempts  used 
correspondence  analysis  to  accommodate  low  frequency 
variables  (words)  in  proﬁ ling  authorial/chronological/cross-
register  variations  in  Dickens  and  Smollett  (Tabata,  2005, 
2007a,  &  c).  Given  the  fact  that  most  collocates  of  content 
words  tend  to  be  low  in  frequency,  my  methodology  based 
on  correspondence  analysis  would  usefully  be  applied  to  a 
macroscopic analysis of collocation of gentleman.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This study uses Smollett’s texts as a control set against which 
the  Dickens  data  is  compared,  in  keeping  with  my  earlier 
investigations.  Dickens  and  Smollett  stand  in  contrast  in  the 
frequency of gentleman. In 23 Dickens texts used in this study, 
the number of tokens for gentleman amounts to 4,547, whereas 
Smollett employs them 797 times in his seven works. In the 
normalised frequency scale per million words, the frequency 
in Dickens is 961.2, while the frequency in Smollett is 714.3. 
However, if one compares the ﬁ rst seven Dickens texts with 
the Smollett set, the discrepancy is even greater: 1792.0 versus 
714.33 per million words. The word gentleman is signiﬁ cantly 
more frequent in early Dickens than in his later works.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Stubbs (2001: 29) states that “[t]here is some consensus, but 
no total agreement, that signiﬁ cant collocates are usually found 
within a span of 4:4”. Following the conventional practice to 
examine collocation (Sinclaire, 1991; Stubbs, 1995 & 2001), the 
present study deals with words occurring within a span of four 
words prior to, and four words following, the node (gentleman) 
as  variables  (collocates)  to  be  fed  into  correspondence 
analysis.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Major  tools  used 
for  collocation  studies  are  KWIC 
concordances  and  statistical  measures,  which  have  been 
designed  to  quantify  collocational  strength  between  words 
in  texts.  With  the  wide  availability  of  highly  functional 
concordancers,  it  is  now  conventional  practice  to  examine 
collocates  in  a  span  of,  say,  four  words  to  the  left,  and  four 
words to the right, of the node (target word/key word) with 
the help of statistics for ﬁ ltering out unimportant information. 
This  conventional  approach  makes  it  possible  to  detect  a 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The respective frequency of each collocate is arrayed to form 
the frequency-proﬁ le for 29 texts (Smollett’s The Adventure of 
an Atom is left out of the data set since it contains no instance of 
gentleman). The set of 29 collocate frequency proﬁ les (collocate 
frequency  matrix)  is  then  transposed  and  submitted  to 
correspondence analysis (CA), a technique for data-reduction. 
CA  allows  examination  of  the  complex  interrelationships 
between  row  cases  (i.e.,  texts),  interrelationships  between 
column  variables  (i.e.,  collocates),  and  association  between 
the  row  cases  and  column  variables  graphically  in  a  multi-
dimensional  space.  It  computes  the  row  coordinates  (word 
_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>scores)  and  column  coordinates  (text  scores)  in  a  way  that 
permutes  the  original  data  matrix  so  that  the  correlation 
between the word variables and text proﬁ les are maximized. 
In a permuted data matrix, adverbs with a similar pattern of 
distribution make the closest neighbours, and so do texts of 
similar proﬁ le. When the row/column scores are projected in 
multi-dimensional  charts,  relative  distance  between  variable 
entries  indicates  afﬁ nity,  similarity,  association,  or  otherwise 
between them.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 2. Correspondence analysis of the collocates 
of gentleman: A galaxy of collocates
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The Dickens corpus is more than four times the size of the 
Smollett  corpus,  and  the  number  of  types  as  well  as  tokens 
of gentleman’s collocates in Dickens is more than four times 
as  many  as  those  in  Smollett.  It  is  necessary  to  ensure  that 
a  size  factor  does  not  come  into  play  in  the  outcome  of 
analysis. Figures 3 and 4 are derived from the variables of 100 
collocates common to both authors. Despite the decrease in 
the number of variables from 1,074 to 100, the conﬁ guration 
of  texts  and  words  is  remarkably  similar  to  that  based  on 
1,074 items. The Dickens set and the Smollett set, once again, 
can  be  distinguished  from  each  other  along  Dimension  1. 
Moreover, in each of the two authors’ sets, early works tend 
to  have  lower  scores  with  later  works  scoring  higher  along 
Dimension 2. The results of the present analysis is consistent 
with my earlier studies based on different variables, such as –ly 
adverbs, superlatives, as well as high-frequency function words. 
It  would  be  possible  to  assume  that  authorial  ﬁ ngerprints 
are  as  ﬁ rmly  set  in  the  collocation  of  gentleman  as  in  other 
component  of  vocabulary.  These  results  seem  to  illustrate 
multivariate  analysis  of  collocates  could  provide  interesting 
new perspectives to the study of collocation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figure 1. Correspondance analysis of the 
collocates of gentleman: Text-map
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Figures  1  and  2  demonstrate  a  result  of  correspondence 
analysis  based  on  1,074  collocates  of  gentleman  across  29 
texts. The  horizontal  axis  of  Figure  1  labelled  as  Dimension 
1,  the  most  powerful  axis,  visualizes  the  difference  between 
the two authors in the distribution of gentleman’s collocates. 
It is also interesting that the early Dickensian texts, written in 
1830s and early 1840s, are lying towards the bottom half of the 
diagram. The same holds true for Smollett. Thus, the horizontal 
axis can be interpreted as indicating authorial variation in the 
collocation  of  gentleman,  whereas  the  vertical  axis  can  be 
interpreted as representing variation over time, although text 
entries do not ﬁ nd themselves in an exact chronological order. 
On the other hand, Figure 2 is too densely populated to identify 
each collocate, except for the outlying collocates, collocates 
with stronger “pulling power”. However, it would be possible 
to  make  up  for  this  by  inspecting  a  diagram  derived  from 
much  smaller  number  of  variables  (say,  100  variables,  which 
will be shown shortly as Figure 4), whose overall conﬁ guration 
is remarkably similar to Figure 2 despite the decrease in the 
number of variables computed.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Video Game Avatar: From 
Other to Self-Transcendence 
and Transformation
Mary L. Tripp
mtripp@mail.ucf.edu
University of Central Florida, USA
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  establish  a  model  for  the 
relationship between the player of a video game and the avatar 
that represents that player in the virtual world of the video 
game. I propose that there is an evolution in the identiﬁ cation 
of the player of a video game with the avatar character that 
performs embodied actions in the virtual world of the game. 
This identiﬁ cation can be described through an examination of 
theories from a variety of subject areas including philosophy, 
literary  studies,  video  game  theory,  and  educational  theory. 
Speciﬁ cally,  theories  in  hermeneutics,  literary  immersion, 
embodiment, empathy, narrative, game ego, play, and learning 
theory  are  synthesized  to  produce  a  broad  picture  of  the 
player/avatar  relationship  as  it  develops  over  time.  I  will 
identify stages in the process of feeling immersed in a game. 
This  feeling  of  immersion  can,  but  may  not  necessarily  will, 
occur  as  the  player  engages  in  game  play  over  a  period  of 
time. I will identify this process in stages: “other”; “embodied 
empathy”; “self-transcendence”;  and “transformation.” At  the 
ﬁ nal  stage,  the  game  play  can  offer  a  critique  of  the  player’s 
worldview, to call into question the player’s approach and even 
presuppositions  about  the  world.  I  suggest  here,  the  player 
no  longer  sees  the  avatar  as  an “other”  a  character  to  be 
understood in some way, and not as some virtual representation 
of the self, something apart from himself, and not even as some 
sort of virtual embodiment of himself. I suggest that the player 
transcends even the avatar as any sort of representation, that 
the  avatar  disappears  from  the  consciousness  of  the  player 
altogether. A  result  of  this  critique  is  a  transformation  that 
takes place within the player that may actually transform one’s 
self-understanding, thus providing the player with an authentic 
learning experience.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There is a sense of embodiment that goes along with controlling 
an avatar in a virtual world that, I believe, is not present when 
becoming immersed in a ﬁ lm or a book. In a video game, the 
player’s  actions  have  direct  and  immediate  consequences 
in  terms  of  reward  or  punishment  as  well  as  movement 
through the virtual world. The narrative effect helps drive the 
character  through  this  reward  and  punishment. The  idea  of 
affordances is often used in terms of game design and the use 
of  emotional  affordances  to  help  propel  the  player  into  the 
virtual environment. Thus, with a video game, there is a more 
complete immersion into the constructed imaginary world—
an embodied immersion and an emotional immersion.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>I would like to clarify the deﬁ nition of this feeling of immersion 
that  happens  as  a  video  game  progresses. Various  terms  are 
used in the ﬁ elds of literary analysis, psychology, video game 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>theory,  and  philosophy.  Terms  like  literary  transport,  ﬂ ow, 
presence,  immersion,  identiﬁ cation,  and  self-transcendence 
are often used to describe the feeling of the self moving out 
of  the  real  world  and  into  a  constructed  imaginary  world. 
I  use  Janet  Murray’s  offers  a  commonly  accepted  deﬁ nition 
used  in  the  gaming  industry  for  this  term,  a  sense  of  being 
physically  submerged  in  water  (Murray  1997,  p.  99).  My  goal 
here is to illuminate the idea that there is a process to gaining 
this  feeling  of  immersion. The  player  proceeds  step-by-step 
into  the  game  world. The  work  of  Gallagher  in  philosophy 
of  mind  acknowledges  that  there  is  a  growth  process  that 
takes  place  in  developing  an  understanding  of  other  people, 
through primary and secondary interaction. Gallese offers an 
alternative  argument  that  the  biological  basis  of  this  growth 
in  understanding  happen  initially  as  a  neural  response  from 
the mirror neuron system, then as a more mature empathetic 
response. Ultimately, I would like to establish a sequence that 
combines the work of Gallese and Gallagher with the work 
of digital narrative theorists Ryan and Murray. The sequence 
of  immersion  could  be  stated  as:  other→empathy→self-
transcendence→transformation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ﬁ rst  stage  of  approaching  the  avatar  is  learning  the 
mechanics of the game. In this stage the player sees the avatar 
as “other,” as an awkward and theoretical representation of the 
self. Initially, the avatar is a picture or symbol for the self. The 
player learns to manipulate the keyboard, mouse, or controller. 
The  avatar  is “other,”  a  foreign  virtual  object  that  must  be 
awkwardly manipulated by the player. In this stage there is little 
personal identiﬁ cation with the avatar, except on a theoretical 
level. The  avatar  cannot  function  efﬁ ciently  according  to  the 
will of the player, but operates as a cumbersome vehicle for 
the player’s intentions.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>I propose that the player in the second stage the player begins 
to  view  the  avatar  as  a  character  in  a  world,  and  the  player 
begins to empathize with the character in a novel or in a ﬁ lm. 
Let me clarify, here, that at this stage the avatar is still viewed 
as Other, but a component of empathy now emerges through 
the use of narrative. The player now has learned to effectively 
manipulate the character, to move the character through the 
virtual world. I believe, here, embodiment plays an important 
biological role in helping to establish this feeling of empathy 
for  the  character. There  is  also  an  important  component  of 
narrative  that  drives  the  player  toward  empathy  with  the 
avatar. The work of Marie-Laure Ryan is an important theoriest 
in this area.

as stated in the work of Gallagher in Hermeneutics and 
Education  and  the  hermeneutic  theories  of  Gadamer 
(speciﬁ cally  his  fusion  of  horizons),  can  establish  how 
understanding happens and how transformation of the self can 
take place more completely in the virtually embodied world 
of video games.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We  offer  a  new  in-depth  methodology  for  looking  at  how 
the  use  of  blogging  software  delineates  and  normalizes  the 
blogger’s creation of posts and, by extension, the creation of 
her blog self. The simple choice of software is not simple at 
all and in fact has a great inﬂ uence on the shape a blogger’s 
identity  will  take  through  the  interface,  program  design, 
and  data  structures  imposed  on  her  by  the  software.   This 
primarily  technical  discussion  of  a  topic  seldom  considered 
in  studies  which  look  at  the  cultural  impact  of  blogging,  will 
illuminate  the  inner  workings  of  the  medium  and  gives  due 
credence to Marshall McLuhan’s argument that “the ‘message’ 
of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or 
pattern that it introduces into human affairs”.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Technology plays such an integral part in distinguishing the blog 
as  a  new  medium,  apart  from  that  of  written  (paper-based) 
text; as a result, a study of the blog that does not investigate 
its infrastructure is incomplete.  Critics of blogging scholarship 
point out the lack of technical discussion around the software 
used by bloggers as a weakness (Scheidt 2005, Lawley 2004).  
The  criticism  is  valid;  critics’  attention  has  been  focused  on 
the output of the blogs, categorizing them as an extension of 
existing genres, whether that be of the diary (Rak 167) or the 
newspaper (Koman).  This study serves as a response to the 
criticism, and aims to start the discussion by looking into the 
dark recesses of the software, databases, and code to illustrate 
just how inﬂ uential infrastructure is in deﬁ ning identity.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Programmers  do  not  care  about  the  content  of  any  given 
blog.    The  people  who  develop  Movable  Type,  Blogger, 
LiveJournal,  and  Wordpress  are  developing  software  which 
helps  making  blogging  a  much  simpler  process,  and  they  do 
listen to customer requests for features.  But the developer 
is not concerned whether your blog will be an online journal, 
a political commentary, or a collection of cat pictures – what 
she is concerned about is memory allocation, disk usage, and 
transaction speed.  Every shortcut taken in the source code, 
every  data  type  or  archiving  scheme  not  supported,  every 
function written, and every decision made by the programmer 
to achieve these goals has an inﬂ uence on the interface, and 
therefore  on  the  content  the  blogger  produces.    Despite 
working  at  an  indifferent  distance,  the  developer  heavily 
inﬂ uences the blog – and by extension, blogger’s identity – by 
the decisions she makes when she codes the software.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  way  we  structure  language  helps  create  meaning; 
likewise,  the  way  in  which  it  is  stored  also  has  meaning. To 
the programmer, language is nothing more than a set of bits 
and data types, which must be sorted into different containers.  
How the programmer deals with data affects how she creates 
the interface; if she has no data structure in place to handle 
a certain kind of information, she cannot request it from the 
user in the interface.  The data structure is created through 
a process called normalization – breaking data down into its 
smallest  logical  parts.    Developers  normalize  data  in  order 
to make it easier to use and reuse in a database: the title of 
your  blog  entry  goes  in  one  container;  the  body  text  goes 
into  another,  and  so  on. The  structure  of  the  data  does  not 
necessarily match the structure of its original context, however.  
Although  a  title  and  the  body  text  are  related  to  the  same 
entry, no consideration is given by the developer as to whether 
one comes before the other, whether it should be displayed 
in a speciﬁ c style, or if one has hierarchical importance over 
the other in the page.  The data structure is dictated by the 
individual pieces of data themselves.  The developer takes the 
data  within  each  of  these  containers  and  stores  it  within  a 
database.  This may be a simple database, such as a CSV1 or 
Berkeley  DB2  ﬁ le,  or  it  may  reside  within  a  more  complex 
relational database such as MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server.  
Within the database exists a series of tables, and within each 
table resides a series of ﬁ elds.  A table holds a single record 
of data – a blog entry – and the table’s ﬁ elds hold properties 
of that data, such as the title or entry date. Figure 1 illustrates 
an example of the above; a developer has created an Entries 
table with the ﬁ elds EntryID3, Title, Date, BodyText, ExtendedText, 
Keywords, Category, and Post Status.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>When  is  possible,  such  as  with  the  Category  and  Post  Status 
ﬁ elds, the developer will actually replace a string (alphanumeric) 
value with a numeric pointer to the same data within another 
table in the database.  For example, an author may create a set 
of categories for her blog (such as “Personal Life,” “School,” et 
cetera, which are stored in a separate database table named 
Categories  and  associated  with  a  unique  ID  (CategoryID).  
When  an  entry  is  marked  with  the  Personal  category,  the 
software  queries  the  database  to  see  what  the  CategoryID 
of the Personal category is in the Categories table, and places 
that  in  the  Category  ﬁ eld  in  an  entry’s  record  in  the  Entries 
table (see Figure 2).  This sets up a series of relations within 
a  database,  and  helps  keep  the  database  smaller;  an  integer 
takes  far  less  space  in  the  database  than  a  string:  1  byte  to 
store a single-digit integer, compared to 8 bytes for the string 
“Personal”; when you start working with hundreds of entries, 
this difference adds up quickly. It is also easier to maintain; if 
you want to rename the “Personal” category to “Stories from 
the woeful events of my unexaggerated life” for example, you 
would  only  have  to  update  the  entry  once  in  the  Categories 
table; because it is referenced by its CategoryID in each entry, 
it will automatically be updated in all records that reference it.  
By abstracting often-used data such as a category into separate 
database tables, data can be reused within the database, which 
in  turn  keeps  the  size  of  the  database  smaller.    If  we  know 
we will be referring to a single category in multiple entries, it 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>makes sense to create a table of possible categories and then 
point to their unique identiﬁ er within each individual entry.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Each  ﬁ eld  within  a  database  table  is  conﬁ gured  to  accept  a 
speciﬁ c  format  of  information  known  as  a  data  type.    For 
example,  the  Date  ﬁ eld  in  the  Entries  table  above  would  be 
given a data type of DATETIME,4 while the Category ﬁ eld would 
be given a data type of INT (to specify an integer value).  The 
body text of an entry would be placed in a binary data type 
known  as  the  BLOB,  since  this  is  a  type  of  data  whose  size 
is variable from record to record.  Normalization conditions 
data  to  its  purpose,  and  ensures  that  the  developer  always 
knows what kind of data to expect when he or she retrieves 
it later.  It also has the beneﬁ t of loosely validating the data by 
rejecting invalid data types.  If an attempt to store a piece of 
INT data in the Date ﬁ eld is made, it will trigger an error, which 
prevents the data from being misused within an application.  
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  decisions  made  by  the  developer  at  this  point,  which 
involve conﬁ guring the tables and ﬁ elds within the database, 
ultimately determine what will appear in the blog’s interface.  
If  tables  and  ﬁ elds  do  not  exist  in  the  database  to  support 
categorization of an entry, for example, it is unlikely to appear in 
the interface since there is no facility to store the information 
(and by extension, not prompt the blogger to categorize her 
thoughts). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The interface gives the blogger certain affordances, something 
Robert  St. Amant  deﬁ nes  as “an  ecological  property  of  the 
relationship  between  an  agent  and  the  environment”  (135).5 
Amant describes affordance as a function we can see that is 
intuitive: “we can often tell how to interact with an object or 
environmental feature simply by looking at it, with little or no 
thought  involved”  (135,  136)  –  for  example,  we  instinctively 
know not only what a chair is for, but the best way to make 
use  of  it.    St.  Amant  further  breaks  down  the  affordance 
into  four  separate  affordance-related  concepts:  relationship, 
action,  perception,  and  mental  construct  (136-7).    He  goes 
on to discuss how to incorporate the idea of affordance into 
developing a user interface, focusing on action and relationship. 
The last of these concepts, affordance as a mental construct, 
is  most  relevant  to  our  discussion.    St. Amant  writes “these 
mental  affordances  are  the  internal  encodings  of  symbols 
denoting  relationships,  rather  than  the  external  situations 
that evoke the symbols” (137).  In the authoring of the blog, 
the affordance of developing identity cannot be pinned on a 
single HTML control or text box; it is the process as a whole.  
LiveJournal  and  DiaryLand,  for  example,  have  the  affordance 
of  keeping  a  personal  journal,  or  online  diary.    Blogger  has 
the affordance of developing identity in a broader way by not 
necessarily  focusing  it  on  an  autobiographical  activity.  The 
interface  leads  the  blogger  into  a  mode  of  writing  through 
the affordances it provides The infrastructure of the blog is its 
most fundamental paratextual element creating a mirror for 
the blogger to peer into, but it is the blogger that makes the 
decision to look.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Text  collation  is  a  vital  aspect  of  textual  editing;  its  results 
feature  prominently  in  scholarly  editions,  either  in  printed 
or  electronic  form.  The  Centre  for  Scholarly  Editing  and 
Document  Studies  (CTB)  of  the  Flemish  Royal  Academy 
for  Dutch  Language  and  Literature  has  a  strong  research 
interest in electronic textual editing. Much of the research for 
the  electronic  editions  of    De  teleurgang  van  den Waterhoek  
(2000)  and    De  trein  der  traagheid  (forthcoming)  concerned 
appropriate ways of visualising textual traditions. Starting from 
the functionality of collation results in electronic editions, as 
illustrated in the latter edition, this paper will investigate the 
needs for a dedicated automatic text collation tool for text-
critical research purposes.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The second section sets out with identifying different scenarios 
in the production model of electronic scholarly editions (based 
on Ott, 1992; Vanhoutte, 2006). Consequently, possible criteria 
for  an  automatic  text  collation  tool  in  these  production 
scenarios  are  identiﬁ ed,  both  on  a  collation-internal  and 
generic software level. These criteria are analysed both from 
the broader perspective of automatic differencing algorithms 
and tools that have been developed for purposes of automatic 
version management in software development (Mouat, 2002; 
Komvoteas, 2003; Cobéna, 2003; Cobéna e.a., 2002 and [2004]; 
Peters, 2005; Trieloff, 2006), and from the speciﬁ c perspective 
of text encoding and collation for academic purposes (Kegel 
and  Van  Elsacker,  2007;  Robinson,  2007).  Collation-internal 
criteria  distinguish  between  three  phases  of  the  collation 
process: the automatic text comparison itself, representation 
of  these  comparisons  and  aspects  of  visualisation.  Especially 
in the context of electronic scholarly editions, for which TEI 
XML  is  the  de  facto  encoding  standard,  a  degree  of  XML-
awareness  can  be  considered  a  minimal  requirement  for 
collation  algorithms. A  dedicated  collation  algorithm  would 
be  able  to  track  changes  on  a  structural  and  on  word  level. 
Moreover,  since  textual  editing  typically  deals  with  complex 
text traditions, the ability to compare more than two versions 
of  a  text  could  be  another  requirement  for  a  collation 
algorithm.  Regarding  representation  of  the  collation  results, 
an XML perspective is preferable as well. This allows for easier 
integration of the collation step with other steps in electronic 
editing. In a maximal scenario, a dedicated text collation tool 
would represent the collation results immediately in one or 
other TEI ﬂ avour for encoding textual variation. Visualisation 
of the collation results could be considered a criterion for a 
text collation tool, but seems less vital, however prominent it

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>features  in  the  broader  context  of  developing  an  electronic 
edition. From a generic software perspective, a dedicated tool 
would be open source, free, multi-platform, and embeddable in 
other applications. These criteria are summarised in a minimal 
and  a  maximal  scenario. The  plea  for  a  tool  that  meets  the 
criteria for a minimal scenario is illustrated in the third section 
of the paper.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  third  section  of  the  paper  is  a  case  study  of  another 
electronic  edition  in  preparation  at  the  CTB:  the  complete 
works  of  the  16th  century  Flemish  poetess  Anna  Bijns, 
totalling  around  300  poems  that  come  in  about  60  variant 
pairs or triplets. The speciﬁ c circumstances of this project led 
to an investigation for collation solutions in parallel with the 
transcription and markup of the texts. After an evaluation of 
some  interesting  candidate  tools  for  the  collation  step,  the 
choice  was  made  eventually  to  investigate  how  a  generic 
XML-aware comparison tool could be put to use for multiple 
text  collations  in  the  context  of  textual  editing.  Besides 
formal procedures and a set of XSLT stylesheets for different 
processing  stages  of  the  collation  results,  this  development 
process provided an interesting insight in the speciﬁ c nature 
of  ‘textual’  text  collation,  and  the  role  of  the  editor.  The 
description of the experimental approach that was taken will 
illustrate  the  criteria  sketched  out  in  the  previous  section, 
indicate what is possible already with quite generic tools, and 
point out the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Finally, the ﬁ ndings are summarised and a plea is made for a text 
collation tool that ﬁ lls the current lacunae with regards to the 
current tools’ capacities for the distinct steps of comparison, 
representation and visualisation.

Humanities Computing

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>On  several  occasions,  Willard  McCarty  has  argued  that  if 
humanities  computing  wants  to  be  fully  of  the  humanities,  it 
needs to become historically self-aware (McCarty, 2004, p.161). 
Contrary to what the frequently repeated myth of humanities 
computing  claims  (de Tollenaere,  1976;  Hockey,  1980,  p.  15; 
1998, p. 521; 2000, p. 5; 2004, p. 4), humanities computing, like 
many  other  interdisciplinary  experiments,  has  no  very  well-
known beginning.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A Common History
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Several  authors  contradict  each  other  when  it  comes  to 
naming the founding father of digital humanities. At least four 
candidates compete with each other for that honour. Depending 
on  whether  one  bases  one’s  research  on  ideas  transmitted 
orally or in writing, on academic publications expressing and 
documenting these ideas, or on academic writings publishing 
results, Father Roberto Busa s.j., the Reverend John W. Ellison, 
Andrew  D.  Booth,  and Warren Weaver  are  the  competitors. 
This is not surprising since, when the use of automated digital 
techniques were considered to process data in the humanities, 
two lines of research were activated: Machine Translation (MT) 
and Lexical Text Analysis (LTA). Booth and Weaver belonged to 
the MT line of research and were not humanists by training, 
whereas Busa and Ellison were LTA scholars and philologists. 
As  Antonio  Zampolli  pointed  out,  the  fact  that  MT  was 
promoted mainly in ‘hard science’ departments and LTA was 
mainly developed in humanities departments did not enhance 
frequent  contacts  between  them.  (Zampolli,  1989,  p.  182) 
Although  real  scholarly  collaboration  was  scarce,  contacts 
certainly existed between the two on the administrative level. 
Since, as Booth (1967, p. VIII) observes, pure linguistic problems 
such  as  problems  of  linguistic  chronology  and  disputed 
authorship, have proﬁ ted from work on MT, the transition from 
MT to Computational Linguistics, dictated by the infamous US 
National Academy of Sciences ALPAC report (ALPAC, 1966), 
was a logical, though highly criticized, step. Moreover, the early 
writings  on  MT  mention  the  essential  use  of  concordances, 
frequency  lists,  and  lemmatization  –  according  to  Zampolli 
(1989) typical products of LTA – in translation methods, which 
shows  that  both  Computational  Linguistics  and  Humanities 
Computing share a common history. This early history of both 
has never been addressed together, but it seems necessary for 
a good understanding of what it is that textual studies do with 
the computer.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The History of Humanities 
Computing
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Researching and writing the history of humanities computing 
is no less but neither no more problematic than researching 
and writing the history of computing, technology in general, or 
the  history  of  recent  thought.  Beverley  Southgate  considers 
the  history  of  thought  as  an  all-embracing  subject  matter 
which  can  include  the  history  of  philosophy,  of  science,  of 
religious,  political,  economic,  or  aesthetic  ideas, ‘and  indeed 
the  history  of  anything  at  all  that  has  ever  emerged  from 
the  human  intellect.’  (Southgate,  2003,  p.  243)  Attached  to 
the  all-embracing  nature  of  what  she  then  calls ‘intellectual 
history/history of ideas’ is the deﬁ ance from the constraints 
of disciplinary structures it creates with its practitioners. The 
history  of  humanities  computing  for  instance  must  consider 
the history of the conventional schools of theory and practice 
of  humanities  disciplines,  the  general  histories  of  computing 
and  technology,  the  history  of  relevant  ﬁ elds  in  computing 
science and engineering, and the history of the application of 
computational techniques to the humanities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The History of Recent Things
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  history  of  recent  things,  however,  poses  some  new  and 
unique  challenges  for  which,  in  Willard  McCarty’s  vision, 
a  different  conception  of  historiography  is  needed.  As  an 
illustration  for  his  point,  McCarty  focuses  on  the  different 
qualities  of  imagination  that  characterize  the  research  and 
writing  of  the  classical  historian  on  the  one  hand  and  the 
historian of recent things on the other and situates them in 
a temporal and a spatial dimension respectively. A successful 
classical  historian  must  manage  the  skill  to  move  into  the 
mental  world  of  the  long  dead,  whereas  the  historian  of 
the  recent  past,  like  the  anthropologist,  must  master  the 
movement  away ‘from  the  mental  world  we  share  with  our 
subjects while remaining engaged with their work’ (McCarty, 
2004,  p.  163).  In  a  rash  moment,  this  double  awareness  of 
the historian of the recent is fair game to triumphalism, the 
historian’s worst ﬁ end. The temptation to search for historical 
and  quantitative,  rather  than  qualitative, ‘evidence’  to  prove 
the  importance  of  their  own  ﬁ eld  or  discipline  is  innate  in 
somewhat ambitious insiders attempting at writing the history 
of their own academic ﬁ eld. Also since, as Alun Munslow has 
reiterated, it is historians rather than the past that generates 
(writes,  composes?)  history  (Munslow,  1999),  McCarty’s 
astute  but  non-exhaustive  catalogue  of  the  new  and  unique 
challenges presents itself as a warning for the historiographer 
of  the  new,  and  I  endorse  this  list  fully: ‘volume,  variety,  and 
complexity of the evidence, and difﬁ culty of access to it; biases 
and partisanship of living informants; unreliability of memory; 
distortions from the historian’s personal engagement with his 
or her informants—the ‘Heisenberg effect’, as it is popularly 
known; the ‘presentism’ of science and its perceived need for 
legitimation  through  an  ofﬁ cial,  triumphalist  account;  and  so 
on.’ (McCarty, 2004, p. 163)

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>All  history  is  inevitably  a  history  for,  and  can  never  be 
ideologically  neutral,  as  Beverly  Southgate  has  recently 
emphasized in a review of Marc Ferro’s The Use and Abuse of 
History, or, How the Past is Taught. (Southgate, 2005) Therefore 
the question can never be ‘Comment on raconte l’histoire aux 
enfants à travers le monde entier’ as the original title of Ferro’s 
book reads. Greg Dening would say that writing history is a 
performance  in  which  historians  should  be ‘focused  on  the 
theatre of what they do’. (Dening, 1996, p. 30) According to 
McCarty, the different conception of historiography, could proﬁ t 
from acknowledging ethnographic theory and ethnography as 
a contributory discipline since it entails a poetic of ‘dilatation 
beyond the textable past and beyond the ‘scientiﬁ c’ reduction 
of evidence in a correct and singular account.’ (McCarty, 2004, 
p. 174)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Prolegomena
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The current lack of theoretical framework that can deﬁ ne and 
study the history of humanities computing echoes what Michael 
Mahoney wrote with respect to the history of computing: ‘The 
major problem is that we have lots of answers but very few 
questions, lots of stories but no history, lots of things to do 
but no sense of how to do them or in what order. Simply put, 
we  don’t  yet  know  what  the  history  of  computing  is  really 
about.’ (Mahoney, 1993)

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Representation of data on regional history by means of Web 
sites is practised in many countries, because such Web sites 
should perform – and more often than not they really perform 
–  three  important  functions.  First,  they  further  preservation 
of historical information related to a certain region. Second, 
Web sites on regional history promote and publicize historical 
and  cultural  heritage  of  a  region,  hence  they  can  serve  as  a 
speciﬁ c ‘visiting-card’ of a region. Third, they facilitate progress 
in regional historical studies by means of involving researchers 
in  Web-community  and  providing  them  with  primary  data 
and,  at  the  same  time,  with  appropriate  research  tools  that 
can  be  used  for  data  retrieving  and  processing.  However, 
implementation  of  the  above-mentioned  functions  calls  for 
different information technologies. For instance, preservation 
of  historical  information  requires  structuring  of  information 
related to a certain region, therefore databases technologies 
should be used to perform this function. In order to draft and 
update a ‘visiting-card’ of a region, a Web site can be designed on 
the basis of Content Management System (CMS). Meanwhile, 
coordination of research activities within the frameworks of 
a certain Web-community calls for implementation of modern 
technologies in order to create knowledge-based information 
systems.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  paper,  a  concept  of  a  knowledge-based  information 
system for regional historical studies is framed and a pattern of 
data representation, aggregation, and structuring is discussed. 
This pattern can be described as a specialized semantic network 
hereafter deﬁ ned as Historical Semantic Network (HSN).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Up  to  now,  the  most  popular  pattern  of  representation 
of  regional  historical  information  is  a  traditional  Web  site 
that  consists  of  static  HTML-pages. A  typical  example  is  the 
Web  site  Latgales  Dati  (created  in  1994,  see  http://dau.lv/ld), 
which  provides  information  about  the  history  and  cultural 
heritage  of  Eastern  Latvia  –  Latgale  (Soms  1995;  Soms  and 
Ivanovs  2002).  On  the Web  site  Latgales  Dati,  historical  data 
are stored and processed according to the above-mentioned 
traditional pattern. The shortcomings of this pattern are quite 
obvious: it is impossible to revise the mode of processing and 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>representation of data on the Web site; it is rather difﬁ cult to 
feed in additional information, to retrieve necessary data, and 
to share information.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  the  HEML  project,  a  special  language  of  representation 
and  linkage  of  information  on  historical  events  has  been 
developed (http://www.heml.org). Advantages of this language 
are  generally  known:  a  modern  approach  to  processing  and 
representation of historical information on the basis of XML, 
a  developed  system  of  tools  of  visualization  of  information, 
etc.  However,  the  processing  of  information  is  subjected  to 
descriptions of historical events. It can be regarded as a drawback 
of this language, since such descriptions do not form a solid 
basis for historical data representation in databases. Actually, 
any  description  of  a  historical  event  is  an  interpretation 
of  narratives  and  documentary  records.  For  this  reason, 
databases  should  embrace  diverse  historical  objects,  namely, 
documents and narratives, persons, historical monuments and 
buildings,  institutions,  geographical  sites,  and  so  on,  and  so 
forth. These objects can be described using different attributes 
simultaneously,  which  specify  characteristic  features  of  the 
objects. Sometimes, objects can be labelled with deﬁ nite, unique 
attributes  only.  The  detailed,  exhaustive  information  about 
the  objects  can  be  represented  by  means  of  links  between 
objects,  thus  creating  a  speciﬁ c  semantic  network.  Within 
this  network,  paramount  importance  is  attached  to  special 
temporal  objects  –  the  chronological ‘markers’.  Connecting 
links between a number of historical objects, including special 
temporal objects, will form rather a solid basis for historical 
discourse upon historical events, processes, and phenomena.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The ﬁ rst characteristic feature of the semantic network, which 
is  being  created  on  the  basis  of  the Web  site  Latgales  Dati, 
is  the  principle  role  assigned  to  such  historical  objects  as 
documentary records and narratives. Thus, the connecting links 
between the objects are constituted (actually, reconstructed) in 
accordance with the evidences of historical sources. In order 
to provide facilities for veriﬁ cation of the links, the semantic 
network should contain full texts of historical records as well 
as  scanned  raster  images  of  them.  On  the  one  hand,  texts 
and images can be directly connected with the objects of the 
semantic network by means of SVG technology; on the other 
hand, this connection can be established by means of mark-up 
schemes used in XML technology (Ivanovs and Varfolomeyev 
2005).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The second characteristic feature of HSN is fuzziness of almost 
all aspects of information in the semantic network (Klir and 
Yuan 1995). The source of this fuzziness is uncertainty of expert 
evaluations  and  interpretations  of  historical  data;  moreover, 
evidences of historical records can be either fragmentary and 
contradictory, or doubtful and uncertain. Therefore, the level of 
validity of information is ‘measured’ by variables, which can be 
expressed by ordinary numbers (0–1). However, it seems that 
they should be expressed by vector quantities as pairs (true, 
false); the components true and false can assume values from 
0 to 1. In this case, the pair (1,1) refers to very contradictory 
and  unreliable  information,  meanwhile  the  pair  (0,0)  means 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
210
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>the  absence  of  information.  This  approach  was  used  in 
construction of four-valued logic (Belnap 1977). The fuzziness 
values deﬁ ned for some objects can be propagated within a 
semantic network by means of logical reasoning (Hähnle 1993). 
This ‘measurement’ of validity of data is performed by users of 
HSN; the results of ‘measurement’ should be changeable and 
complementary,  thus  reﬂ ecting  cooperation  of  researchers 
within the frameworks of Web-community.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Creating  a  semantic  network,  a  number  of  principal 
operations should be performed: reconstruction, linkage, and 
representation.  Reconstruction  is  either  manual  or  automatic 
generation  of  interrelations  between  objects  that  are  not 
directly  reﬂ ected  in  historical  records.  In  this  stage,  new 
historical objects can emerge; these objects are reconstructed 
in  accordance  with  the  system  of  their  mutual  relations. 
Linkage can be deﬁ ned as detection of similar (in fuzzy sense) 
objects, which within a semantic network (or within a number 
of interrelated networks) form a deﬁ nite unit. Representation is 
a number of operations of retrieving of data from the semantic 
network including representation of information by means of 
tables, graphs, timeline, geographic visualization, etc.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>HSN  as  a  basic  pattern  of  representation  of  historical 
information  in  Internet  provides  researchers  with  proper 
tools,  which  can  easily  transform  data  retrieved  from  such 
Web sites. However, some problems should be solved in order 
to ‘substitute’ the traditional Web site Latgales Dati for HSN. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There are different approaches to representation of semantic 
networks in Internet. A generally accepted approach is division 
of network links into subjects, predicates, and objects followed 
by their representation by means of RDF. However, the RDF 
pattern (actually, directed graph in terms of mathematics) is not 
adequate to the hyper-graph pattern accepted in HSN, since 
in HSN one and the same link can connect different objects 
simultaneously.  In  order  to  represent  hyper-graphs,  different 
semantic  networks  –  such  as  WordNet  (Fellbaum  1998), 
MultiNet (Helbig 2006), topic maps (Dong and Li 2004) or even 
simple Wiki-texts  interconnected  by  so-called ‘categories’  – 
should be used. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned semantic 
networks do not provide proper tools to perform the tasks 
set  by  HSN.  For  this  purpose,  the  experience  acquired  by 
designers  of  universal  knowledge  processing  systems  (e.g. 
SNePS, see Shapiro 2007, or Cyc, see Panton 2006) should be 
taken into consideration. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  principles  of  creation  of  HSN  substantiated  above  are 
used  in  designing  a  new  version  of  the  knowledge-based 
information  system  Latgales  Dati.  As  software  environment 
a  specialized Web  application  created  at  Petrozavodsk  State 
University is applied (http://mf.karelia.ru/hsn).

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>One  more  important  problem  is  linkage  of  different  HSN,

to historical data and exchange of information and results of

carry out this task. In this case, HSN should be registered in 
a certain UDDI-server. A user’s query activates interaction of 
a Web-server with numerous related Web-servers, which are 
supplied  with  HSN-module. As  a  result,  a  semantic  network 
is  being  generated  on  the  basis  of  fragments  of  different 
networks relevant to the initial query.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Using Wmatrix to investigate 
the narrators and characters 
of Julian Barnes’ Talking It 
Over
Brian David Walker

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  focus  of  this  paper  is  on Wmatrix  (Rayson  2008),  and 
how the output from this relatively new corpus tool is proving 
useful in connecting language patterns that occur in Talking It 
Over - a novel by Julian Barnes - with impressions of narrators 
and  characters.  My  PhD  research  is  concerned  with:  1)  the 
role of the narrator and author in characterisation in prose 
ﬁ ction, in particular how the narrator intervenes and guides 
our perception of character – something that, in my opinion, 
has not been satisfactorily dealt with in existing literature; and 
2) how corpus tools can be usefully employed in this type of 
investigation. In this paper I will show that Wmatrix helps to 
highlight parts of the novel that are important insofar as theme 
and/or narratorial style and/or characterisation. I will go on to 
discuss difﬁ culties I encountered during my investigation, and 
possible developments to Wmatrix that could be beneﬁ cial to 
future researchers.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Of  course,  computer-assisted  approaches  to  the  critical 
analyses of novels are no longer completely new, and corpus 
stylistics (as it is sometimes known) is a steadily growing area of 
interest. Indeed, corpus approaches have already been used to 
investigate character in prose and drama. McKenna and Antonia 
(1996), for example, compare the internal monologues of three 
characters  (Molly,  Stephen  and  Leopold)  in  Joyce’s  Ulysses, 
testing the signiﬁ cance on the most frequent words in word-
lists for each character, and showing that common word usage 
can form “[…] distinct idioms that characterize the interior 
monologues  […]”  (McKenna  and  Antonia  1996:65).  Also, 
more  recently,  Culpeper  (2002)  uses  the ‘KeyWord’  facility 
in WordSmith Tools  (Scott  1996)  to  demonstrate  how  the 
analysis of characters’ keywords in Shakespeare’s Romeo and 
Juliet can provide data to help establish lexical and grammatical 
patterns for a number of the main characters in the play.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>While  my  research  adopts  similar  approaches  to  the  two 
examples above, it takes a small yet useful step beyond word-
level analysis, focussing instead on semantic analysis and key-
concepts. This is possible because Wmatrix can analyse a text 
at the semantic level (see below). 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Wmatrix
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Wmatrix  (Rayson  2008)  is  a  web-based  environment  that 
contains a number of tools for the analyses of texts. Plain-text 
versions of texts can be uploaded to the Wmatrix web-server 
where  they  are  automatically  processed  in  three  different 
ways: 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1) Word level – frequency lists of all the words in a text are 
compiled and can be presented either in order of frequency 
or alphabetically;
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2) Grammatical level – using the Constituent Likelihood 
Automatic Word-tagging System (CLAWS – see Garside 
1987, 1996; Leech, Garside and Bryant 1994; and Garside 
and Smith 1997) developed by the University Centre for 
Computer Corpus Research on Language (UCRELi) at 
Lancaster University, every word in a text is assigned a 
tag denoting the part-of-speech (POS) or grammatical 
category to which the word belongs. The words are then 
presented in list form either alphabetically (by POS tag) or 
by frequency (the most frequent POS tags at the top of the 
list);
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3) Semantic level – every word is semantically tagged using 
the UCREL semantic analysis system (USASii) and then listed 
in order of frequency or alphabetically by semantic tag. 
USAS groups words together that are conceptually related. 
It assigns tags to each word using a hierarchical framework 
of categorization, which was originally based on MacArthur’s 
(1981) Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English. Tags consist 
of an uppercase letter, which indicates the general discourse 
ﬁ eld, of which there are 21 – see Table 1.

division of the ﬁ eld. For example, the major semantic ﬁ eld of 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC DOMAIN is designated by the letter 
G. This major ﬁ eld has three subdivisions: GOVERNMENT, POLITICS 
AND  ELECTIONS  –  tagged  G1;  CRIME,  LAW  AND  ORDER  –  tagged 
G2; and WARFARE, DEFENCE AND THE ARMY – tagged G3. The ﬁ rst 
subdivision (G1 - GOVERNMENT, POLITICS AND ELECTIONS) is further 
divided into: GOVERNMENT ETC. – which is has the tag G1.1; and 
POLITICS – which is tagged G1.2.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>From these initial lists, further analyses and comparisons are 
possible within the Wmatrix environment. However, the focus 
of  this  paper  will  be  on  my  analysis  of  the  USAS  (semantic) 
output from Wmatrix, as this output proves to be the most 
interesting and the most useful interpretatively.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>draw attention to important themes within the narrations, and 
to styles of narration which can then be linked to character 
traits.  Included  in  my  discussion  will  be  issues  concerning 
Wmatrix’s lexicon and the type of automated semantic analysis 
Wmatrix carries out.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Data
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Talking It Over, by Julian Barnes, is a story with a fairly familiar 
theme – a love triangle – that is told in a fairly unusual way 
– there are nine ﬁ rst person narrators. This offers interesting 
data  with  regard  to  the  interaction  between  character  and 
narrator,  as  the  story  is  told  from  a  number  of  different 
perspectives,  with  the  different  narrators  often  commenting 
on the same events from different angles. Of the nine narrators 
Oliver,  Stuart  and  Gillian  are  the  three  main  ones,  not  only 
because they are the three people involved in the love triangle, 
but also because they say substantially more than any of the 
other  narrators  in  the  novel.  The  six  other  narrators  are 
people whose involvement in the story is more peripheral, but 
come into contact with one or more of the main narrators. 
Within the novel each contribution by different narrators is 
signalled by the narrator’s name appearing in bold-type at the 
beginning of the narration. Some chapters consist of just one 
contribution from one narrator while others consist of several 
“narrations”. The three main narrators make contributions of 
varying lengths throughout the novel.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Approach
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The exploration of narrators described in this paper adopts 
a  similar  approach  to  that  used  by  Culpeper  (2002)  in  his 
analysis  of  characters  in  Romeo  and  Juliet. That  is,  I  compare 
the  words  of  one  narrator  with  the  words  of  all  the  other 
narrators  combined,  using Wmatrix  in  its  capacity  as  a  tool 
for text comparison. This comparison produced a number of 
lists ranked by statistical signiﬁ cance. The measure of statistical 
signiﬁ cance used by Wmatrix is log-likelihood (LL).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  process  of  comparison  involved,  to  some  extent, 
disassembling the novel, in order to extract, into separate text 
ﬁ les, the narrated words of each of the three main narrators. 
The  disassembly  process  had  to  take  into  account  the  fact 
that within the different narrations there were the words of 
other  people  and  characters. That  is  to  say,  the  narrations 
contained speech, writing and thought presentation (SW&TP). 
This needed to be accounted for in the analysis in order to 
be as precise as possible about descriptions and impressions 
of narrators based on the Wmatrix output. The best way to 
achieve  this  was  to  produce  a  tagged  version  of  the  novel, 
from which relevant portions could be extracted more exactly 
using computer-tools. These extracted portions could then be 
analysed using Wmatrix. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>My paper will discuss the tagging process, the Wmatrix output 
and  the  subsequent  analysis  and  show  how  key  semantic 
concepts  highlighted  for  each  of  the  three  main  characters 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Interpretative conclusions
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  list  of  semantic  groups  produced  by Wmatrix  for  each 
of  the  three  main  narrators  show  a  number  of  differences 
in  narrator  characteristics  and  narratorial  styles.  Stuart’s  list 
contains semantic groups that relate to his job. An investigation 
of highly signiﬁ cant categories in the list showed that Stuart’s 
attitude  relating  to  particular  themes  or  concepts  change 
during the novel. For example, Stuart’s relationship with money 
alters, which is reﬂ ected in a change of attitude toward love. 
Stuart also becomes less worried about disappointing people 
and more concerned about not being disappointed himself.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>An investigation of items in Gillian’s list of semantic categories 
identiﬁ ed  a  more  conversational  style  to  her  narration 
when  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  narrators,  as  well  as  a 
determination  to  give  an  account  of  the  story  that  was 
accurate and complete. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The top item in Oliver’s list of categories contains the words 
that Wmatrix could not match. While on one hand this could 
be seen as a short-coming of Wmatrix, in the case of this study, 
the  result  gave  a  clear  indication  of  the  number  of  unusual, 
foreign and hyphenated words Oliver uses, and showed that 
he has very broad vocabulary as well as knowledge of a wide 
variety of topics. The list of unmatched words also highlighted 
Oliver’s  creativity  with  language,  and  that  creativity  is  very 
much part of his style. He uses unusual, technical and poetic 
words  in  place  of  more  commonplace  synonyms  and  this 
could  be  seen  as  evidence  towards  Oliver  being  showy  and 
ﬂ amboyant.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Wmatrix development
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  results  from  this  study,  in  particular  those  relating  to 
Oliver’s narration and the failure of Wmatrix to successfully 
categorise many of the words used in it, raise issues regarding 
the  tool’s  lexicon  and  the  semantic  categories  it  uses. 
These  issues  will  be  discussed  as  potential  avenues  for  the 
development  of  this  useful  corpus  tool.  For  instance,  the 
Wmatrix-lexicon  is  currently  progressively  updated  and 
expanded, meaning that, in practice, there is no one static point 
from  which  comparisons  of  texts  can  be  made. While  there 
is  a  case  for  a  lexicon  that  is  as  comprehensive  as  possible, 
the present way of managing the lexicon can cause difﬁ culties 
for research projects that continue over an extended period 
of  time.  However,  creating  a ‘standard’  ﬁ xed  lexicon  is  not 
without difﬁ culties and raises questions about what counts as 
‘standard’. Even though Wmatrix allows users to deﬁ ne their 
own lexicon, a possible way forward might be to have multiple

research needs.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>My paper will examine both a speciﬁ c digital humanities project, 
The  Chymistry  of  Isaac  Newton  <http://www.chymistry.org/>, 
and reﬂ ect more broadly on the ﬁ eld of digital humanities, by 
suggesting useful parallels between the disciplines of alchemy 
and digital humanities. The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project is 
an effort to digitize and edit the alchemical writings of Newton 
and  to  develop  digital  scholarly  tools  (reference,  annotation, 
and visualization) for interacting with the collection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Newton’s  “chymistry”  has  recently  become  a  topic  of 
widespread public interest.[1] It is no longer a secret that the 
pre-eminent scientist of the seventeenth century spent some 
thirty  years  working  in  his  alchemical  laboratory,  or  that  he 
left a manuscript Nachlass of about 1,000,000 words devoted 
to  alchemy.  Newton’s  long  involvement  in  chymistry  ﬁ gures 
prominently  in  NOVA’s  2005 “Newton’s  Dark  Secrets,”  and 
it  occupies  a  major  portion  of  the  documentary’s  website 
at  <http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/>.  Even  more 
attention was devoted to Newton’s alchemy in the 2003 BBC 
production “Newton: The Dark Heretic.” Newton’s chymistry 
also is featured in recent popularizing studies such as Gleick’s 
2003  Isaac  Newton  and White’s  1997  Isaac  Newton:  the  Last 
Sorcerer. Despite the fascination that Newton’s chymistry holds 
for the public, the subject has not received a corresponding 
degree of scrutiny from historians since the untimely passing 
of B.J.T. Dobbs in 1994 and Richard Westfall in 1996. Dobbs 
had made the issue of Newton’s alchemy a cause célèbre in her 
inﬂ uential  historical  monograph,  The  Foundations  of  Newton’s 
Alchemy of 1975, and Westfall built upon her work in his own 
magisterial biography of Newton, Never at Rest , of 1980.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  relative  lack  of  subsequent  scholarly  grappling  with 
Newton’s alchemy is regrettable for many reasons, particularly 
since  Dobbs  and  Westfall  raised  strong  claims  about  the 
relationship  of  his  alchemical  endeavors  to  his  physics.  In 
particular, they suggested that Newton’s concept of force at 
a  distance  was  strongly  inﬂ uenced  by  his  work  in  alchemy, 
and that it was alchemy above all else that weaned Newton 
away  from  the  Cartesian  mechanical  universe  in  favor  of  a 
world governed by dynamic interactions operating both at the 
macrolevel and the microlevel. Although Dobbs backed away 
from these earlier positions in her 1991 Janus Faces of Genius, 
she made the equally strong claim there that Newton’s alchemy 
was primarily concerned with the operations of a semi-material 
ether that acted as God’s special agent in the material world. 
Westfall  too  emphasized  the  putative  connections  between 
Newton’s religion and his alchemy.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Interestingly,  the  historical  speculations  of  Westfall,  Dobbs, 
and  their  popularizers  have  relatively  little  to  say  about  the 
relationship of Newton’s alchemy to the alchemical tradition 
that he inherited. Perhaps because of the underdeveloped state 
of the historiography of alchemy in the 1970s, both Westfall 
and Dobbs portrayed Newton’s seemingly obsessive interest 
in the subject as something exotic that required the help of 
extradisciplinary motives to explain it. Hence Dobbs looked 
beyond chymistry itself, invoking the aid of Jungian psychology 
in  her  Foundations  (1975)  and  that  of  Newton’s  heterodox 
religiosity  in  her  Janus  Faces  (1991).  In  neither  case  did  she 
see  chymistry  as  a  ﬁ eld  that  might  have  attracted  Newton 
on its own merits. Recent scholarship, however, has thrown a 
very different picture on alchemy in the seventeenth-century 
English speaking world. We now know that Newton’s associate 
Robert  Boyle  was  a  devoted  practitioner  of  the  auriﬁ c  art, 
and  that  the  most  inﬂ uential  chymical  writer  of  the  later 
seventeenth  century,  Eirenaeus  Philalethes,  was  actually  the 
Harvard-trained experimentalist George Starkey, who tutored 
Boyle  in  chymistry  during  the  early  1650s.  Boyle’s “literary 
executor,”  the  empiricist  philosopher  John  Locke,  was  also 
deeply involved in chrysopoetic chymistry, and even Newton’s 
great mathematical rival, Leibniz, had an abiding interest in the 
subject. In short, it was the norm rather than the exception 
for serious scientiﬁ c thinkers of the seventeenth century to 
engage themselves with chymistry. We need no longer express 
amazement at the involvement of Newton in the auriﬁ c art, but 
should ask, rather, how he interacted with the practices and 
beliefs of his predecessors and peers in the burgeoning ﬁ eld 
of seventeenth-century chymistry. A ﬁ rst step in this endeavor, 
obviously,  lies  in  sorting  out  Newton’s  chymical  papers  and 
making them available, along with appropriate digital scholarly 
tools, for systematic analysis.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The most recent phase of the project focuses on digital tools, 
including  a  digital  reference  work  based  on  Newton’s  Index 
Chemicus, an index, with bibliographic references, to the ﬁ eld 
and literature of alchemy. Newton’s Index includes 126 pages 
with 920 entries, including detailed glosses and bibliographic 
references.  Our  online  reference  work  edition  of  Newton’s 
Index will not be constrained by Newton’s original structure 
and will extend functionality found in traditional print-based 
reference  works.  It  will  leverage  information  technologies 
such as searching and cross-linking to serve as an access point 
to the domain of seventeenth-century alchemy and a portal to 
the larger collection and to visualizations that graphically plot 
the  relative  occurrences  of  alchemical  terms,  bibliographic 
references, and other features of the collection. Other tools 
being developed include systems for user annotation of XML-
encoded texts and facsimile page images.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>My presentation will look at current progress, developments, 
and  challenges  of  the  Chymistry  of  Isaac  Newton. With  this 
project as context, I will venture into more theoretical areas 
and examine parallels between alchemy and digital humanities. 
For example, like digital humanities, alchemy was an inherently 
interdisciplinary ﬁ eld. Bruce T. Moran, in his Distilling Knowlege  
describes alchemy as an activity “responding to nature so as 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>to make things happen without necessarily having the proven 
answer  for  why  they  happen”  (10).  This  approach  has  a 
counterpart  in  the  playful  experimentation  and  affection  for 
serendipitious discovery found in much digital humanities work. 
Moran also explains that the “primary procedure” of alchemy 
was distillation, the principle purpose of which was to “make the 
purest substance of all, something linked, it was thought, to the 
ﬁ rst stuff of creation” (11). Similarly, much of digital humanities 
work  is  a  process  of  distillation  in  which  visualizations  or 
XML  trees,  for  instance,  are  employed  to  reveal  the “purest 
substance”  of  the  text  or  data  set.  Codes  and  symbols  and 
metadata were important parts of the alchemical discipline, as 
they are in digital humanities. Alchemy also had a precarious 
place in the curriculum. Moran, again, indicates that “although 
a sprinkling of interest may be found in the subject within the 
university, it was, as a manual art, always denied a part in the 
scholastic curriculum” (34). Digital Humanities is likewise often 
cordoned off from traditional humanities departments, and its 
practice and research is conducted in special research centers, 
newly created departments of digital humanities, or in schools 
of information science. The idea of the alchemist as artisan and 
the digital humanist as technician is another interesting parallel 
between the two ﬁ elds. My paper will examine these and other 
similarities between the two ﬁ elds and examine more closely 
the works of individual alchemists, scientists, and artists in this 
comparative  context.  Alchemy  is  an  interdisciplinary  ﬁ eld--
like  much  digital  humanities  work--that  combines  empirical 
science,  philosophy,  spirituality,  literature,  myth  and  magic, 
tools and totems. I will argue that, as we escape the caricature 
of alchemy as a pseudo-science preoccupied with the occult, 
alchemy can serve as a useful model for future directions in 
digital humanities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>[1]As William  R.  Newman  and  Lawrence  M.  Principe  have 
argued in several co-authored publications, it is anachronistic 
to distinguish “alchemy” from “chemistry” in the seventeenth 
century.  The  attempt  to  transmute  metals  was  a  normal 
pursuit  carried  out  by  most  of  those  who  were  engaged  in 
the  varied  realm  of  iatrochemistry,  scientiﬁ c  metallurgy,  and 
chemical  technology.  The  fact  that  Newton,  Boyle,  Locke, 
and  other  celebrated  natural  philosophers  were  engaged 
in  chrysopoeia  is  no  aberration  by  seventeenth-century 
standards.  Hence  Newman  and  Principe  have  adopted  the 
inclusive  term  “chymistry,”  an  actor’s  category  employed 
during the seventeenth century, to describe this overarching 
discipline. See William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe, 
“Alchemy  vs.  Chemistry:  The  Etymological  Origins  of  a 
Historiographic Mistake,” Early Science and Medicine 3(1998), 
pp.  32-65.  Principe  and  Newman, “Some  Problems  with  the 
Historiography  of  Alchemy,”  in  William  R.  Newman  and

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Electronic  text  projects  range  in  complexity  from  simple 
collections  of  page  images  to  bundles  of  page  images  and 
transcribed text from multiple versions or editions (Haarhoff, 
Porter). To facilitate navigation within texts and across texts, 
an increasing number of digital initiatives, such as the Princeton 
University Library Digital Collections (http://diglib.princeton.

Cymru  (http://www.culturenetcymru.com)  and  the  Library 
of  Congress  (http://www.loc.gov/index.html),  are  relying  on 
the complementary strengths of open standards such as the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and the Metadata Encoding and 
Transmission  Standard  (METS)  for  describing,  representing, 
and delivering texts online.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The core purpose of METS is to record, in a machine-readable 
form, the metadata and structure of a digital object, including 
ﬁ les that comprise or are related to the object itself. As such, 
the  standard  is  a  useful  tool  for  managing  and  preserving 
digital  library  and  humanities  resources  (Cantara;  Semple). 
According to Morgan Cundiff, Senior Standards Specialist for 
the Library of Congress, the maintenance organization for the 
METS standard:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>METS  is  an  XML  schema  designed  for  the  purpose  of 
creating  XML  document  instances  that  express  the 
hierarchical  structure  of  digital  library  objects,  the  names 
and locations of the ﬁ les that comprise those digital objects, 
and the associated descriptive and administrative metadata. 
(53)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Similarly,  the TEI  standard  was  developed  to  capture  both 
semantic  (e.g.,  metadata)  and  syntactic  (e.g.,  structural 
characteristics)  features  of  a  document  in  machine-readable 
form that promotes interoperability, searchability and textual 
analysis. According to the Text Encoding Initiative web site, the 
TEI standard is deﬁ ned thusly:

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>from  which  a  full  METS  document  can  be  automatically

Navigator. The TEI, much like METS, provides a rich vocabulary 
and  framework  for  encoding  descriptive  and  structural 
metadata for a variety of documents. The descriptive metadata 
typically found in the TEI Header may be used to populate the 
corresponding components (descriptive metadata section) of 
a  METS  document. The  embedded  structural  metadata  that 
describe  divisions,  sections,  headings  and  page  breaks  in  a 
TEI  document  may  be  used  to  generate  the  structural  map 
section of a METS document. Unlike the TEI, the METS scheme 
has explicit mechanisms in place for expressing relationships 
between multiple representations of the digital content such 
as encoded text ﬁ les and page images. By integrating the TEI-
METS  workﬂ ow  into  METS  Navigator,  scholars  and  digital 
library  and  humanities  programs  can  more  easily  implement 
online text collections. Further, the intersection between TEI 
and METS documents can provide the foundation for enhanced 
end-user exploration of electronic texts.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The IU Digital Library Program as a result of enhancing the 
functionality and modularity of the METS Navigator software 
is  also  in  the  process  of  formalizing  and  integrating  the TEI-
METS workﬂ ow in support of online page turning. Our paper 
will trace the development of METS Navigator including the 
TEI-METS workﬂ ow, demonstrate the METS Navigator system 
using  TEI-cum-METS  documents,  review  METS  Navigator 
conﬁ guration options, detail ﬁ ndings from recent user studies, 
and outline plans for current and future development of the 
METS Navigator.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange 
deﬁ ne and document a markup language for representing 
the structural, renditional, and conceptual features of texts. 
They  focus  (though  not  exclusively)  on  the  encoding  of 
documents  in  the  humanities  and  social  sciences,  and  in 
particular on the representation of primary source materials 
for  research  and  analysis. These  guidelines  are  expressed 
as  a  modular,  extensible  XML  schema,  accompanied  by 
detailed documentation, and are published under an open-
source license. (“TEI Guidelines”)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>METS,  as  its  name  suggests,  is  focused  more  exclusively  on 
metadata.  While  digital  objects—such  as  a  text,  image,  or 
video—may  be  embedded  within  a  METS  document,  METS 
does  not  provide  guidelines,  elements  and  attributes  for 
representing the digital object itself; rather, the aim of METS is 
to describe metadata about a digital object and the relationships 
among  an  object’s  constituent  parts.  In  sum,  METS  is  data-
centric; TEI is document-centric.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  April  2006,  the 
Indiana  University  Digital  Library 
Program  released  a  beta  version  of  METS  Navigator  (http://
metsnavigator.sourceforge.net/),  a  METS-based,  open  source 
software solution for the discovery and display of multi-part 
digital objects. Using the information in the METS structural 
map elements, METS Navigator builds a hierarchical menu that 
allows  users  to  navigate  to  speciﬁ c  sections  of  a  document, 
such  as  title  page,  speciﬁ c  chapters,  illustrations,  etc.  for  a 
book.  METS  Navigator  also  allows  simple  navigation  to  the 
next, previous, ﬁ rst, and last page image or component parts 
of a digital object. METS Navigator can also make use of the 
descriptive metadata in the METS document to populate the 
interface with bibliographic and descriptive information about 
the  digital  object.  METS  Navigator  was  initially  developed  at 
Indiana  University  (IU)  for  the  online  display  and  navigation 
of brittle books digitized by the IU Libraries’ E. Lingle Craig 
Preservation  Laboratory.  However,  realizing  the  need  for 
such a tool across a wide range of digital library projects and 
applications, we designed the system to be generalizable and 
conﬁ gurable. To assist with the use of METS Navigator for new 
projects, a METS proﬁ le, also expressed in XML, is registered 
with  the  Library  of  Congress  (http://www.loc.gov/standards/
mets/proﬁ les/00000014.html).  The  proﬁ le  provides  detailed 
documentation about the structure of the METS documents 
required by the METS Navigator application.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Cantara  reported  in  her  brief  article,  “The  Text-Encoding 
Initiative: Part 2,” that discussion of the relationship between 
the TEI  and  METS  was  a  primary  focus  during  the  Fourth 
Annual TEI  Consortium  Members’  Meeting  held  in  2004  at 
Johns  Hopkins  University  (110).  The  relationship  between 
the  standards  was  also  a  topic  of  discussion  during  the 
2007  Members’  Meeting,  and  was  speciﬁ cally  raised  in  Fotis 
Jannidis’  plenary  entitled  “TEI  in  a  Crystal  Ball.”  Despite 
these  discussions,  the  community  is  still  lacking  a  well-
documented workﬂ ow for the derivation of METS documents 
from  authoritative TEI  ﬁ les. We  believe  the TEI,  if  properly 
structured, can be used as the “master” source of information

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper presents the results of a study by the VERA project 
(Virtual Research Environment for Archaeology: http://vera.
rdg.ac.uk ) which aimed to investigate how archaeologists use 
information technology (IT) in the context of a ﬁ eld excavation. 
This study was undertaken by researchers at School of Library, 
Archive and Information Studies, University College London, 
who  collaborate  on  the  project  with  the  School  of  Systems 
Engineering,  and  the  Department  of Archaeology,  University 
of Reading.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>VERA  is  funded  by  the  JISC Virtual  Research  Environments 
Programme,  Phase  2, 
(http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/
programmes/vre2.aspx) and runs from April 2007 until March 
2009. We aim to produce a fully operational virtual research 
environment for the archaeological community. Our work is 
based on a research excavation of part of the large Roman town 
at Silchester, which aims to trace the site’s development from 
its  origins  before  the  Roman  Conquest  to  its  abandonment 
in  the  ﬁ fth  century A.D  (Clarke  et  al  2007). This  complex 
urban  site  provides  the  material  to  populate  the  research 
environment,  utilising  the  Integrated  Archaeological  Data 
Base (IADB: http://www.iadb.co.uk/specialist/it.htm), an online 
database  system  for  managing  recording,  analysis,  archiving 
and  online  publication  of  archaeological  ﬁ nds,  contexts  and 
plans. The  dig  allows  us  to:  study  the  use  of  advanced  IT  in 
an  archaeological  context;  investigate  the  tasks  carried  out 
within  archaeological  excavations;  ascertain  how  and  where 
technology can be used to facilitate information ﬂ ow within 
a  dig;  and  inform  the  designers  of  the  IADB  how  it  may  be 
adapted  to  allow  integrated  use  of  the  tools  in  the  trench 
itself.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Research Context
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Although archaeologists were quick to embrace IT to aid in 
research  analysis  and  outputs  (Laﬂ in  1982,  Ross  et  al  1990, 
Reilly  and  Rahtz  1992),  and  the  use  of  IT  is  now  central  to

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>the  manipulation  and  display  of  archaeological  data  (Lock 
and  Brown  2000,  McPherron  and  Dibble,  2002,  Lock  2003) 
the use of IT to aid ﬁ eld archaeology is in its relative infancy 
due to the physical characteristics of archaeological sites, and 
the difﬁ culties of using IT in the outdoor environment. Whilst 
the  use  of  electronic  surveying  equipment  (total  stations, 
(Eiteljorg,  1994))  and  digital  cameras  is  now  common  place 
on archaeological sites there are relatively few archaeological 
organizations that use digital recording methods to replace the 
traditional paper records which rely on manual data input at 
a (sometimes much) later date. With ever increasing amounts 
of data being generated by excavations onsite databases are 
becoming increasingly necessary, for example at the excavations 
at Catalhoyuk in Turkey (http://www.catalhoyuk.com/database/
catal/) and the site of Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport (http://
www.framearch.co.uk/t5/),  and  some  archaeologists  have 
begun to use digital data input from total stations, PDAs, tablet 
PCs, digital cameras, digital callipers, digital pens and barcodes 
(McPherron and Dibble, 2003, Dibble et al., 2007). For many 
excavations, however, the use of IT is restricted to the analysis 
stage rather than ﬁ eld recording. The aim of the VERA project 
is  to  investigate  the  use  of  IT  within  the  context  of  a  ﬁ eld 
excavation and to ascertain if, and how, it may be appropriated 
to speed up the process of data recording, entry and access.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Method
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We used a diary study to gather information about the work 
patterns of different archaeological roles and the way that they 
are supported by both digital and analogue technologies. The 
study was carried out by the UCL team, at the Silchester dig 
during the summer of 2007. (http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/
la/silchester/publish/ﬁ eld/index.php) 
from 
Reading also carried out a study into the use of ICT hardware 
to  support  digging  and  data  entry. A  detailed  record  of  the 
progress of both the dig and the study was kept on the VERA 
blog (http://vera.rdg.ac.uk/blog).
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Researchers 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Diary studies enable researchers to understand how people 
usually  work  and  can  be  used  to  identify  areas  that  might 
be  improved  by  the  adoption  of  new  working  practices  or 
technologies. (O’Hara et al. 1998). They have been used in the 
area of student use of IT, and to study the work of humanities 
scholars.  (Rimmer  et.  al.  Forthcoming)  however,  this  is  the 
ﬁ rst  use  of  this  method  to  study  ﬁ eld  archaeology  that  we 
are aware of.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>During  diary  studies,  participants  are  asked  to  keep  a 
detailed  record  of  their  work  over  a  short  period  of  time. 
The participant records the activity that they are undertaking, 
what  technologies  they  are  using  and  any  comments  they 
have on problems or the progress of their work. This helps us 
to  understand  the  patterns  of  behaviour  that  archaeologists 
exhibit, and how technology can support these behaviours.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>survey  participants  (role,  team,  status)  and  their  experience 
of  using  the  technology  on  site. A  cross  section  of  people 
representing different types of work and levels of experience 
were  chosen.  For  example  we  included  inexperienced  and 
experienced  excavators;  members  of  the  ﬁ nds  team,  who 
process  the  discoveries  made  on  site;  those  who  produce 
plans of the site and visitor centre staff.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A  deﬁ ned  area  of  the  Silchester  site  was  used  to  test  the 
use  of  new  technologies  to  support  excavation.  In  this  area 
archaeologists  used  digital  pens  and  paper,  (http://www.
logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/digital_pen/devices/
408&cl=us,en ) digital cameras, and Nokia N800 PDAs (http://
www.nokia.co.uk/A4305204).  Diaries  from  this  area  were 
compared to those using traditional printed context sheets to 
record their work.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Findings
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This paper will present the ﬁ ndings from the study, covering 
various issues such as the attitude of archaeologists to diary 
studies, previous and present experiences of using technology 
on research excavations, the effect of familiarity of technology 
on  uptake  and  use,  and  resistance  and  concerns  regarding 
the  use  of  technology  within  an  archaeological  dig. We  also 
evaluate  speciﬁ c  technologies  for  this  purpose,  such  as  the 
Nokia N800 PDA, and Logitech Digital Pens, and ascertain how 
IT can ﬁ t into existing workﬂ ow models to aid archaeologists 
in tracking information alongside their very physical task.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Future work
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This year’s diary study supplied us with much interesting data 
about the past, current and potential use of IT in the trench. 
We will repeat the study next year to gain more detailed data. 
Participants will be asked to focus on a shorter period of time, 
one or two days, as opposed to ﬁ ve this year. Next year we 
will have a research assistant on site, allowing us to undertake 
interviews  with  participants,  clarify  entries,  and  build  up  a 
good  working  relationship  with  experts  working  on  the 
excavation. Two periods of diary study will also be undertaken, 
allowing  for  analysis  and  reﬁ ning  methods  between  studies. 
This  will  also  be  juxtaposed  with  off-site  user  testing  and 
analysis workshops of the IADB, to gain understanding of how 
archaeologists  use  technology  both  on  and  off  site. We  also 
plan  to  run  an  additional  training  session  in  the  use  of  ICT 
hardware before the start of next year’s dig, in addition to the 
usual archaeological training.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The aim of this study is to feed back evidence of use of IT to 
the team developing the virtual environment interface of the 
IADB. It is hoped that by ascertaining and understanding user 
needs,  being  able  to  track  and  trace  information  workﬂ ow 
throughout  the  dig,  and  gaining  an  explicit  understanding  of 
the  tasks  undertaken  by  archaeologists  that  more  intuitive

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A Webplatform for Philosophers
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>LogiLogi  becomes  an  easy  to  use  hypertext  platform,  also 
featuring a rating- and review-system which is a bit comparable 
to  that  found  in  journals.  It  tries  to  ﬁ nd  the  middle-road 
between the written word and a good conversation, and it’s 
central values are openness and quality of content.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>LogiLogi  is  a  hypertext  platform  featuring  a  rating-system 
that  tries  to  combine  the  virtues  of  good  conversations 
and  the  written  word.  It  is  intended  for  all  those  ideas  that 
you’re unable to turn into a full sized journal paper, but that 
you  deem  too  interesting  to  leave  to  the  winds.  It’s  central 
values  are  openness  and  quality  of  content,  and  to  combine 
these values it models peer review and other valuable social 
processes  surrounding  academic  writing  (in  line  with  Bruno 
Latour). Contrary to early websystems it does not make use 
of  forumthreads  (avoiding  their  many  problems),  but  of  tags 
and links that can also be added to articles by others than the 
original author. Regardless of our project, the web is still a very 
young medium, and bound to make a change for philosophy in 
the long run.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The growth of the web has been rather invisible for philosophy 
so  far,  and  while  quite  some  philosophizing  has  been  done 
about  what  the  web  could  mean  for  the  human  condition, 
not  much  yet  has  been  said  about  what  it  could  mean  for 
philosophy  itself  (ifb;  Nel93;  Lev97,  mainly). An  exception  is 
some  early  enthusiasm  for  newsgroups  and  forums  in  the 
nineties,  but  that  quickly  died  out  when  it  became  apparent 
that those were not suitable at all for in-depth philosophical 
conversations. The  web  as  a  medium  however  is  more  than 
these two examples of early web-systems, and in the meantime 
it has further matured with what some call Web 2.0, or social 
software (sites like MySpace, Del.icio.us and Wikipedia). Time 
for a second look. . .
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>LogiLogi  Manta  (Log),  the  new  version  of  LogiLogi,  is 
a  webplatform  that  hopes  to  —  be  it  informally  and 
experimentally—allow  philosophers  and  people  who  are 
interested  in  philosophy  to  use  the  possibilities  that  the 
internet  has  in  stock  for  them  too.  It  was  started  with  a 
very  small  grant  from  the  department  of  Philosophy  of  the 
Rijksuniversiteit  Groningen.  It  is  Free  Software,  has  been 
under development for almost 2 years, and will be online by 
June 2008. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>It makes commenting on texts, and more generally the linking 
of  texts  very  easy.  Most  notably  it  also  allows  other  people 
than  the  original  author  of  an  article  to  add  outgoing  links 
behind words, but it does not allow them to change the text 
itself, so the author’s intellectual responsibility is guarded. Also 
important is that all conversations on the platform run via links 
(comparable  to  footnotes),  not  via  forum-threads,  avoiding 
their  associated  problems  like  fragmentation  and  shallowing 
of the discussion.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To maximize the advantages of hypertext, texts are kept short 
within LogiLogi, at maximum one to a few pages. They can be 
informal and experimental and they can be improved later on, 
in either of two ways: The text of the original document can be 
changed (earlier versions are then archived). Or secondly, links 
can be added inside the text, possibly only when some terms 
or concepts appear to be ambiguous, when questions arise, or 
when the text appears to arouse enough interest to make it 
worth of further elaboration. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Links  in  LogiLogi  can  refer  to  documents,  to  versions,  and 
— by default — to tags (words that function as categories or 
concepts). Articles can be tagged with one or more of these 
tags. Multiple articles can have the same tag, and when a link is 
made to a tag or to a collection of tags, multiple articles can be 
in the set referred to. From this set the article with the highest 
rating is shown to the user.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  essence  one  can  rate  the  articles  of  others  by  giving 
them  a  grade. The  average  of  these  grades  forms  the  rating 
of the article. But this average is a weighted average. Voting-
powers  can  vary.  If  an  authors  contributions  are  rated  well, 
he receives more voting-power. Authors can thus gain ’status’ 
and ’inﬂ uence’ through their work. This makes LogiLogi a peer-
reviewed meritocracy, quite comparable to what we, according 
to  Bruno  Latours  philosophy  of  science,  encounter  in  the 
various structures surrounding journals (Lat87). Most notably 
this quality control by peer review, and it’s accompanying social 
encouragement, was missing from earlier web-systems.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>But the comparison goes further, and in a similar fashion to 
how  new  peergroups  can  emerge  around  new  journals,  in 
LogiLogi  too  new  peergroups  can  be  created  by  duplicating 
the just described rating-system. Contributions can be rated 
from the viewpoints of different peergroups, and therefore an 
article can have multiple ratings, authors won’t have the same 
voting-power  within  each  peergroup,  and  visitors  can  pick 
which peergroup to use as their ﬁ lter. Thus except meritocratic, 
LogiLogi is also open to a diversity of schools and paradigms 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  the  following  paragraph  we  will  explain  what  LogiLogi  is, 
and in section 3 LogiLogi and the web as a new medium are 
embedded in the philosophical tradition. Optionally section 2 
can be read only after you have become interested by reading 
3.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>in the sense of early Thomas Kuhn (Kuh96), especially as here 
creating new peergroups—unlike for journals—does not bring 
startup-costs.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Plato, Free Software and 
Postmodernism
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  web  is  a  relatively  new  medium,  and  new  media  are 
usually  interpreted  wrongly  —  in  terms  of  old  media. This 
is  has  been  called  the  horseless  carriage  syndrome  (McL01); 
according  to  which  a  car  is  a  carriage  without  a  horse,  ﬁ lm 
records theater-plays, and—most recently—the web enables 
the  downloading  of  journals.  Even  Plato  was  not  exempt  of 
this. In Phaedrus he stated that true philosophy is only possible 
verbally, and that writing was just an aid to memory. Regardless 
of  this  ironically  enough  his  ’memory  aid’  unleashed  a  long 
philosophical  tradition  (dM05).  New  media  take  their  time. 
And  we  should  not  forget  that  the  web  is  still  very  young 
(1991). Also  the  web  is  especially  relevant  for  philosophy  in 
that  it  combines  conversation  and  writing;  the  two  classical 
media of philosophy. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>And where previous mass-media like TV and radio were not 
suitable  for  philosophy,  this  was  because  they  were  one  to 
many, and thus favored the factory model of culture (Ado91). The 
web on the other hand is many to many, and thereby enables 
something  called  peer  to  peer  production  (Ben06). An  early 
example of this is Free Software: without much coordination 
tenthousands  of  volunteers  have  created  software  of  the 
highest  quality,  like  Linux  and  Firefox.  Eric  Raymond  (Ray99) 
described  this  as  a  move  from  the  cathedral-  to  the  bazaar-
model  of  software  development. The  cathedral-model  has  a 
single architect who is responsible for the grand design, while 
in the bazaar-model it evolves from collective contributions. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This bazaar-model is not unique for the web. It shares much 
with  the  academic  tradition.  The  move  from  the  book  to 
the  journal  can  be  compared  with  a  move  in  the  direction 
of  a  bazaar-model.  Other  similarities  are  decentralized 
operation  and  peer-review. The  only  new  thing  of  the  Free 
Software example was it’s use of the web which — through 
it’s  shorter  turnaround  times  —  is  very  suitable  for  peer  to 
peer production. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Another  development  that  LogiLogi  follows  closely  is  one 
within philosophy itself: Jean-Franois Lyotard in his La Condition 
Postmoderne  proclaimed  the  end  of  great  stories  (Lyo79). 
Instead  he  saw  a  diversity  of  small  stories,  each  competing 
with  others  in  their  own  domains.  Also  Derrida  spoke  of 
the materiality of texts, where texts and intertextuality gave 
meaning  instead  of  ’pure’  ideas  (Ber79;  Nor87). The  web  in 
this  sense  is  a  radicalisation  of  postmodernism,  allowing  for 
even more and easier intertextuality. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>And instead of trying to undo the proliferation of paradigms, as 
some logic-advocates tried, and still try, we think the breakdown 
of language—as in further segmentation—is here to stay, and 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>even a good thing, because it reduces complexity in the sense 
of  Niklas  Luhmann  (Blo97). Take  human  intelligence  as  ﬁ xed 
and you see that specialized (or ’curved’ as in curved space) 
language  allows  for  a  more  precise  analysis.  LogiLogi  thus  is 
explicitly modeled to allow for ﬁ ne-grained specialization, and 
for a careful deﬁ nition and discussion of terms in context.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Conclusion
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  reiterate;  LogiLogi  will  offer  an  easy  to  use  hypertext-
environment, and thanks to it’s rating system a combination of 
quality and openness will be achieved: everyone can contribute, 
and even start new peergroups, but within peergroups quality 
is the determining factor. LogiLogi thus combines the informal, 
incremental  and  interactive  qualities  of  good  conversations, 
with conservation over time and space, as we traditionally know 
from the written word. LogiLogi is still very experimental.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Nevertheless what we can be sure about is that the web, as 
a medium that has proven to be very suitable for peer to peer 
production  and  that  promises  increased  inter-textuality  and 
differentiation  of  language,  is  bound  to  make  a  change  for 
philosophy in the long run; with or without LogiLogi.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  This  research  is  the  result  of  the  collaboration  of  the 
Departments of Literature and Medicine of the University of 
Rome “Tor Vergata”.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Marco  Zanasi’s  idea  of  coding  and  studying  dream  reports 
of  his  patients  at Tor Vergata  University  Hospital  Psychiatric 
Unit  started  a  team  research  on  a  challenging  hypothesis:  Is 
there any correlation between linguistic realization of dream 
reports and the psychopathology from which the dreamer is 
suffering? So far, analyses of dream reports have focused mainly 
on  actants,  settings,  and  descriptors  of  emotional  condition 
during the oneiric activity.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  goal  of  “Dream  Coding”  is  to  collect,  transcribe, 
catalogue,  ﬁ le,  study,  and  comment  on  dreams  reported  by 
selected patients at Tor Vergata University Hospital in Rome. 
In the group of observed patients, different psychopathological 
statuses are represented.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  build  up  a  code  which  would 
enable a different reading of the reports that patients make of 
their dreams. A code that in the future could also provide new 
tools for initial and on-going diagnoses of the psychopathology 
affecting the patients.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Then  we  want  to  verify  a  set  of  linguistic  features  that  can 
be  signiﬁ cantly  correlated  to  the  type  of  psychopathology 
on a statistical basis. Numerous aspects, both theoretical and 
methodological, are discussed in this paper, ranging from the 
nature of the variation of language to be investigated to the tag 
set to be used in corpus preparation for computer analysis.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  ﬁ rst  issue  that  the  analysis  has  to  solve  is  the  speech 
transcription and how to obtain an accurate transcoded text 
from the oral form. After having considered several working 
hypothesis we have decided to use a “servile transcription” of 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
223
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>_____________________________________________________________________________
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Digital Humanities 2008
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>the speech: by recording the narrators’ voice and transferring 
it in an electronic format.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>At an early stage, we realized that some important elements 
of  the  speech  could  get  lost  in  this  process. This  is  why  we 
have decided to reproduce the interruptions and hesitations. 
Interruptions have been classiﬁ ed on the basis of their length.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Starting from this consideration a form (enclosed) has been 
created in order to catalogue the dreams and other data, such 
as age, sex, address, birthday, job, and so on.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Furthermore  the  form  contains  information  related  to  the 
transcriptor so as to detect the “noise” added by them. The 
noise  can  be  partially  isolated  by  noticing  the  continuity  of 
some elements.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Obtained data is stored on the computer as a word ﬁ le (.rtf 
format) to be analyzed later on. The working process has been 
divided into four steps, namely:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>1. ﬁ rst step: in this step we collect the data of the patients 
that already have a diagnosis (che hanno già una diagnosi?)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>2. second step: in this step we analyze the dreams collected 
in the previous phase and point out (individuare?) recurrent 
lexical structures (ricorrenti?)
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>3. third step: in this step we collect data from all other 
patients in order to analyze them and propose a kind of 
diagnosis
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>4. fourth step: in this step we make a comparison between 
the results of the ﬁ rst group of patients and the second 
one, and try to create a “vademecum” of the particularities 
noticed from a linguistic point of view. We call this 
classiﬁ cation “textual diagnosis”, to be compared with 
the “medical diagnosis”, in order to verify pendants and 
incongruities.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Although our research is at a preliminary stage, the statistical 
results on text analysis obtained so far allow us to make a few 
considerations. The ﬁ rst noticeable aspect is that differences 
between  dreams  of  psychopathologic  patients  and  controls 
are observed, which suggests the existence of speciﬁ c features 
most likely correlated to the illness. We also observe a scale of 
narration complexity progressively decreasing from psychotic 
to bipolar patients and to controls. Since the patients recruited 
are in a remission phase, we may hypothesize that the variations 
observed are expression of the underlying pathology and thus 
not  due  to  delusions,  hallucinations,  hypomania,  mania  and 
depression.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Under  the  notation  of “text  architecture”  we  have  included 
items  such  as  coherence  and  cohesion  and  the  anaphoric 
chains. The complete, quantitative results will be soon available, 
but it is possible to show at least the set of variables for which 
the texts will be surveyed, in order to account for the lexical 
variety we registered.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  syntactic  and  semantic  opposition  of  NEW  and  GIVEN 
information is the basis according to which both formal and 
content items will be annotated. Therefore, as an example of 
the connection between formal and content items, the use of 
deﬁ nite or indeﬁ nite articles will be linked to the introduction 
of the following new narrative elements:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• a new character is introduced in the plot, be it a human 
being or an animal;
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• a shift to a character already in the plot;
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• a new object appears in the scene;
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• a shift to an object already in the plot;
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>• a shift of location without a verb group expressing the 
transfer.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  difﬁ culty  of  recognizing  any  shift  of  time  of  the  story 
without  the  appropriate  time  adverb  or  expression  in  the 
discourse, made it not relevant to register this variation since 
it  would  be  necessarily  correlated  with  the  correct  formal 
element.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The non-coherent and often non-cohesive structure of many 
patients’  dreams  shows  to  be  relevant  to  determine  what 
the ratios indicate as a richer lexicon. The consistent, abrupt 
introduction of NEW pieces of information, especially when 
correlated with the formal features, is likely to be one of the 
most signiﬁ cant differences between the control persons and 
patients,  as  well  as  between  persons  of  the  ﬁ rst  two  large 
psychopathologic categories analyzed here, bipolar disorders 
and psychotic disorders.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our research is an ongoing project that aims to amplify samples 
and  evaluate  the  possible  inﬂ uences  of  pharmacological 
treatments on the oniric characteristics being analyzed.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We have elaborated a measurement system for interruptions 
that  we  called “Scale  of  Silence”;  it  provides  several  special 
mark-ups  for  the  interruptions  during  the  speech. The  scale 
(that is in a testing phase) has three types of tags according 
to the length of the interruption (0-2 sec; 2-4 sec; 4 or more). 
Special tags are also used for freudian slips and self-corrections 
the narrator uses.   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>For such an accurate analysis the research group has started 
marking the texts of the dreams reports. The marking will allow 
the computer-aided analyses on semantics, syntax, rhetorical 
organization,  metaphorical  references  and  text  architecture.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Chinese  version  of  JGAAP  supports  Chinese  word 
segmentation ﬁ rst then followed by a feature selection process 
at word level, as preparation for a later analytic phase. After 
getting a set of ordered feature vectors, we then use different 
analytical  methods  to  produce  authorship 
judgements. 
Unfortunately,  the  errors  introduced  by  the  segmentation 
method(s)  will  almost  certainly  inﬂ uence  the  ﬁ nal  outcome, 
creating a need for testing.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Almost all methods for Chinese word segmentation developed 
so far are either structural (Wang et al., 1991) and statistical-
based (Lua, 1990). A structural algorithm resolves segmentation 
ambiguities by examining the structural relationship between 
words,  while  a  statistical  algorithm  usually  compares  word 
frequency  and  character  co-occurrence  probability  to 
detect word boundaries. The difﬁ culties in this study are the 
ambiguity  resolution  and  novel  word  detection  (personal 
names, company names, and so on). We use a combination of 
Maximum Matching and conditional probabilities to minimize 
this error.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Maximum  matching  (Liu  et  al.,  1994)  is  one  of  the  most 
popular  structural  segmentation  algorithms,  the  process 
from the beginning of the text to the end is called Forward 
Maximal  Matching  (FMM),  the  other  way  is  called  Backward 
Maximal Matching (BMM). A large lexicon that contains all the 
possible words in Chinese is usually used to ﬁ nd segmentation 
candidates for input sentences. Here we need a lexicon that 
not only has general words but also contains as many personal 
names,  company  names,  and  organization  names  as  possible 
for detecting new words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Before we scan the text we apply certain rules to divide the 
input sentence into small linguistic blocks, such as separating 
the  document  by  English  letters,  numbers,  and  punctuation, 
giving us small pieces of character strings. The segmentation 
then  starts  from  both  directions  of  these  small  character 
strings. The  major  resource  of  our  segmentation  system  is 
this large lexicon. We compare these linguistic blocks with the 
words  in  the  lexicon  to  ﬁ nd  the  possible  word  strings.  If  a 
match is found, one word is segmented successfully. We do this 
for both directions, if the result is same then this segmentation 
is accomplished. If not, we take the one that has fewer words. 
If  the  number  of  words  is  the  same,  we  take  the  result  of 
BMM as our result. As an example : Suppose ABCDEFGH is 
a character string, and our lexicon contains the entries A, AB, 
ABC, but not ABCD. For FMM, we start from the beginning of 
the string (A) If A is found in the lexicon, we then look for AB 
in the lexicon. If AB is also found, we look for ABC and so on, 
till the string is not found. For example, ABCD is not found 
in the Lexicon, so we consider ABC as a word, then we start 
from character D unti the end of this character string. BMM 
is just the opposite direction, starting with H, then GH, then 
FGH, and so forth.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Suppose the segmentation we get from FMM is
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(a) A \ B \ CD \ EFG \ H
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>and the segmentation from BMM is
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(b) A \ B \ C \ DE \ FG \ H
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We will take result (a), since it has fewer 
words. But if what we get from BMM is
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(c) AB \ C \ DE \ FG \ H
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We will take result (c), since the numbers 
of words is same in both method.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>After  the  segmentation  step  we  take  the  advantage  of 
JGAAP’s  features  and  add  different  event  sets  according  to 
the  characteristics  of  Chinese,  then  apply  statistical  analysis 
to  determine  the  ﬁ nal  results.  It  is  not  clear  at  this  writing, 
for example, if the larger character set of Chinese will make 
character-based methods more effective in Chinese then they 
are  in  other  languages  written  with  the  Latin  alphabet  (like 
English). It is also not clear whether the segmentation process 
will produce the same type of set of useful “function words” 
that are so useful in English authorship attribution. The JGAAP 
structure  (Juola  et  al,  2006;Juola  et  al.,  submitted),  however, 
will make it easy to test our system using a variety of different 
methods and analysis algorithms.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In order to test the performance on Chinese of our software, 
we are in the process of constructing a Chinese test corpus. 
We  will  select  three  popular  novelists  and  ten  novels  from 
each one, eight novels from each author will be used as training 
data, the other two will be used as testing data. We will also 
test  on  the  blogs  which  will  be  selected  from  internet. The 
testing procedure will be the same as with the novels.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  research  demonstrates,  ﬁ rst,  the  JGAAP  structure  can 
easily be adapted to the problems of non-Latin scripts and not 
English languages, and second, provides somes cues to the best 
practices of authorship attribution in Chinese. It can hopefully 
be extended to the development of other non-Latin systems 
for authorship attribution.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  paper  we  investigate  how  currently  emerging  link 
detection  methods  can  help  enrich  encoded  archival 
descriptions. We  discuss  link  detection  methods  in  general, 
and  evaluate  the  identiﬁ cation  of  names  both  within,  and 
across,  archival  descriptions.  Our  initial  experiments  suggest 
that  we  can  automatically  detect  occurrences  of  person 
names with high accuracy, both within (F-score of 0.9620) and 
across  (F-score  of  1)  archival  descriptions. This  allows  us  to 
create  (pseudo)  encoded  archival  context  descriptions  that 
provide  novel  means  of  navigation,  improving  access  to  the 
vast amounts of archival data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Introduction
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Archival  ﬁ nding  aids  are  complex  multi-level  descriptions 
of  the  paper  trails  of  corporations,  persons  and  families. 
Currently, ﬁ nding aids are increasingly encoded in XML using 
the  standard  Encoded  Archival  Descriptions.  Archives  can 
cover  hundreds  of  meters  of  material,  resulting  in  long  and 
detailed  EAD  documents. We  use  a  dataset  of  2,886  EAD 
documents from the International Institute of Social History 
(IISG) and 3,119 documents from the Archives Hub, containing 
documents with more than 100,000 words. Navigating in such 
archival ﬁ nding aids becomes non-trivial, and it is easy to loose 
overview of the hierarchical structure. Hence, this may lead to 
the loss of important contextual information for interpreting 
the records.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Archival context may be preserved through the use of authority 
records  capturing  information  about  the  record  creators 
(corporations, persons, or families) and the context of record 
creation.  By  separating  the  record  creator’s  descriptions 
from  the  records  or  resources  descriptions  themselves,  we 
can  create “links”  from  all  occurrences  of  the  creators  to 
this  context. The  resulting  descriptions  of  record  creators 
can be encoded in XML using the emerging Encoded Archival 
Context  (EAC) standard. Currently, EAC has only been applied 
experimentally. One of the main barriers to adoption is that 
it  requires  substantial  effort  to  adopt  EAC. The  information 
for the creator’s authority record is usually available in some

where  a  token  is  a  sequence  of  non-space  characters. We 
collect a list of the name variants that we expect to encounter: 
“J.M. Den Uyl”, “Joop M. Den Uyl”, “Johannes Marten den Uyl”, 
“Den  Uyl”,  etc. We  construct  a  regular  expression  to  fetch 
the  name  variants. The  results  are  depicted  in  illustration  1, 
which shows the local view of the Joop den Uyl archive in our 
Retrieving EADs More Effectively (README) system.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Link Detection Methods
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Illustration 1: Links detected in EAD
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>form (for example, EAD descriptions usually have a detailed 
ﬁ eld <bioghist> about the archive’s creator). However, linking 
such a context description to occurrences of the creator in 
the archival descriptions requires more structure than that is 
available in legacy data.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Our  main  aim  is  to  investigate  if  and  how  automatic  link 
detection  methods  could  help  improve  archival  access. 
Automatic  link  detection  studies  the  discovery  of  relations 
between  various  documents.  Such  methods  have  been 
employed to detect “missing” links on the Web and recently 
in  the  online  encyclopedia  Wikipedia.  Are  link  detection 
methods sufﬁ ciently effective to be fruitfully applied to archival 
descriptions? To answer this question, we will experiment on 
the detection of archival creators within and across ﬁ nding aids. 
Based on our ﬁ ndings, we will further discuss how detected 
links  can  be  used  to  provide  crucial  contextual  information 
for  the  interpretation  of  records,  and  to  improve  navigation 
within and across ﬁ nding aids.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Links generated by humans are abundant on the World Wide 
Web, and knowledge repositories like the online encyclopedia 
Wikipedia. There are two kinds of links: incoming and outgoing 
links.  Substrings  of  text  nodes  are  identiﬁ ed  as  anchors  and 
become  clickable.  Incoming  links  come  from  text  nodes 
of  target  ﬁ les  (destination  node)  and  point  to  a  source  ﬁ le 
(origin node), while an outgoing link goes from text node in 
the source document (origin node) to a target ﬁ le (destination 
node). Two assumptions are made: a link from document A to 
document B is a recommendation of B by A, and documents 
linked to each other are related.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>To  automatically  detect  whether  two  nodes  are  connected, 
it  is  necessary  to  search  the  archives  for  some  string  that 
both share. Usually it is only one speciﬁ c and extract string. A 
general approach to automatic link detection is ﬁ rst to detect 
the  global  similarity  between  documents.  After  the  relevant 
set  of  documents  has  been  collected,  the  local  similarity  can 
be  detected  by  comparing  text  segments  with  other  text 
segments in those ﬁ les. In structured documents like archival 
ﬁ nding  aids,  these  text  segments  are  often  marked  up  as 
logical units, whether it be the title <titleproper>, the wrapper 
element <c12> deep down in the ﬁ nding aid, or the element 
<persname> that identiﬁ es some personal names. These units 
are  identiﬁ ed  and  retrieved  in  XML  Element  retrieval. The 
identiﬁ cation  of  relevant  anchors  is  a  key  problem,  as  these 
are used in the system’s retrieval models to point to (parts of) 
related ﬁ nding aids. 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Experiment: Name Detection
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>A speciﬁ c name detection trial with the archive of Joop den 
Uyl  (1919-1987),  former  Labor  Party  prime  minister  of  the 
Netherlands, is done as a test to deal with this problem. This 
archive consists of 29,184 tokens (with removal of the XML 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The quality of the name detection trial is evaluated with explicit 
feedback, which means manually checking the detected links 
for (1) correctness, (2) error, and (3) whether any links were 
missing. This  was  done  both  within  ﬁ nding  aids,  and  across 
ﬁ nding aids:
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- First, the quality is checked within ﬁ nding aids, by locating 
occurrences of creator Joop den Uyl in his archive. For 
detecting name occurrences within an archive, our simple 
method has a precision of (114/120 =) 0.9500, a recall of 
(114/117 =) 0.9744, resulting in an F-score of 0.9620. Some 
interesting missing links used name variants where the 
preﬁ x “den” is put behind the last name “Uyl” -- a typical 
Dutch practice. Incorrect links mostly are family members 
occurring the archive, e.g., “Saskia den Uyl”, “E.J. den Uyl-van 
Vessem”, and also “Familie Den Uyl”. Since these names 
occur relatively infrequent, few errors are made. The 
matching algorithm could easily be reﬁ ned based on these 
false positives.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>- Second, the same procedure to detect proper names of 
Joop den Uyl is applied across ﬁ nding aids with the related 
archive of “Partij van de Arbeid Tweede-Kamer Fractie 
(1955-1988)” (Dutch MPs from the Labor Party). For 
detecting name occurrences across archives, we obtain a 
perfect precision, recall, and thus F-score of 1.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Concluding Discussion 
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In  this  paper  we  investigated  how  currently  emerging 
link  detection  methods  can  help  enrich  encoded  archival 
descriptions. We discussed link detection methods in general, 
and  evaluated  the  identiﬁ cation  of  names  both  within,  and 
across,  archival  descriptions.  Our  initial  experiments  suggest 
that  we  can  automatically  detect  occurrences  of  person 
names,  both  within  (F-score  of  0.9620)  and  across  (F-score 
of 1) archival descriptions. This allows us to create (pseudo) 
encoded  archival  context  (EAC)  descriptions  that  provide 
novel  means  of  navigation  and  improve  access  to  archival 
ﬁ nding  aids. The  results  of  our  experiments  were  promising, 
and can also be expanded to names of organizations, events, 
topics, etc. We expect those to be more difﬁ cult than personal 
name detection.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>There are more uses for detecting cross-links in ﬁ nding aids 
besides  creating  extra  contextual  information.  Detecting 
missing links is useful for improving the retrieval of separate 
ﬁ nding  aids,  for  example,  an  archival  ﬁ nding  aid  with  many 
detected incoming links may have a higher relevance. Links can 
also offer a search-by-example approach, like given one ﬁ nding 
aids, ﬁ nd all related ﬁ nding aids. A step further is to use the 
cross-links  in  the  categorization  of  archival  data.  Concretely 
for historians and other users, who rely on numerous lengthy 
archival  documents,  new  insights  can  be  gained  by  detecting 
missing cross-links.

Authorship Attribution 
Analysis Program

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>  Authorship  Attribution  (Juola,  in  press)  is  a  form  of  text 
analysis to determine the author of a given text. Authorship 
Attribution  in  Chinese  (AAC)  is  that  task  when  the  text 
is  written  in  Chinese.  It  can  be  considered  as  a  typical 
classiﬁ cation problem, where a set of documents with known 
authorship are used for training and the aim is to automatically 
determine  the  corresponding  author  of  an  anonymous  text. 
Beyond simple questions of the identity of individual authors, 
the underlying technology may also apply to gender, age, social 
class, education and nationality.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>JGAAP (Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program) (Juola 
et al., 2006) is a program aimed at automatically determining 
a document’s author by using corpus linguistics and statistical 
analysis.  It  performs  different  types  of  analysis  and  gives  the 
best results to the user while hiding the detailed methods and 
techniques involved. It can therefore be used by non-experts. 
We  extend  JGAAP  to  cover  the  special  issues  involved 
in  Chinese  attribution  and  present  the  results  of  some 
experiments involving novels and blogs.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Why can’t we just use the existing JGAAP software? Chinese 
introduces its own problems, caused by the different structures 
of  English  and  Chinese.  As  with  English,  Chinese  texts  are 
composed  of  sentences,  sentences  are  composed  of  words, 
and words are composed of characters. However, the Chinese 
character set is approximately 50,000 individually meaningful 
characters, compared with ﬁ fty or so meaningless symbols for 
English. Furthermore, in Chinese texts words are not delimited 
by spaces as they are in English. As with English, the word is the 
basic meaningful unit in Chinese, but the meaning of a word 
may differ from the meaning of the characters compose this 
word.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Analysis at the character level is thus fundamentally different 
between the two languages. Studies in English show that analysis 
at the word level is likely to be a better way to understand 
the  style  and  linguistic  features  of  a  document,  but  it  is  not 
clear whether this will apply to Chinese as well. So before we 
can analyze word-level features (for comparison) we need to 
segment sentences at word-level not by characters. Therefore 
the ﬁ rst step for any Chinese information processing system 
is  the  automatically  detection  of  word  boundaries  and 
segmentation.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>The  Chinese  version  of  JGAAP  supports  Chinese  word 
segmentation ﬁ rst then followed by a feature selection process 
at word level, as preparation for a later analytic phase. After 
getting a set of ordered feature vectors, we then use different 
analytical  methods  to  produce  authorship 
judgements. 
Unfortunately,  the  errors  introduced  by  the  segmentation 
method(s)  will  almost  certainly  inﬂ uence  the  ﬁ nal  outcome, 
creating a need for testing.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Almost all methods for Chinese word segmentation developed 
so far are either structural (Wang et al., 1991) and statistical-
based (Lua, 1990). A structural algorithm resolves segmentation 
ambiguities by examining the structural relationship between 
words,  while  a  statistical  algorithm  usually  compares  word 
frequency  and  character  co-occurrence  probability  to 
detect word boundaries. The difﬁ culties in this study are the 
ambiguity  resolution  and  novel  word  detection  (personal 
names, company names, and so on). We use a combination of 
Maximum Matching and conditional probabilities to minimize 
this error.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Maximum  matching  (Liu  et  al.,  1994)  is  one  of  the  most 
popular  structural  segmentation  algorithms,  the  process 
from the beginning of the text to the end is called Forward 
Maximal  Matching  (FMM),  the  other  way  is  called  Backward 
Maximal Matching (BMM). A large lexicon that contains all the 
possible words in Chinese is usually used to ﬁ nd segmentation 
candidates for input sentences. Here we need a lexicon that 
not only has general words but also contains as many personal 
names,  company  names,  and  organization  names  as  possible 
for detecting new words.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Before we scan the text we apply certain rules to divide the 
input sentence into small linguistic blocks, such as separating 
the  document  by  English  letters,  numbers,  and  punctuation, 
giving us small pieces of character strings. The segmentation 
then  starts  from  both  directions  of  these  small  character 
strings. The  major  resource  of  our  segmentation  system  is 
this large lexicon. We compare these linguistic blocks with the 
words  in  the  lexicon  to  ﬁ nd  the  possible  word  strings.  If  a 
match is found, one word is segmented successfully. We do this 
for both directions, if the result is same then this segmentation 
is accomplished. If not, we take the one that has fewer words. 
If  the  number  of  words  is  the  same,  we  take  the  result  of 
BMM as our result. As an example : Suppose ABCDEFGH is 
a character string, and our lexicon contains the entries A, AB, 
ABC, but not ABCD. For FMM, we start from the beginning of 
the string (A) If A is found in the lexicon, we then look for AB 
in the lexicon. If AB is also found, we look for ABC and so on, 
till the string is not found. For example, ABCD is not found 
in the Lexicon, so we consider ABC as a word, then we start 
from character D unti the end of this character string. BMM 
is just the opposite direction, starting with H, then GH, then 
FGH, and so forth.

<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>Suppose the segmentation we get from FMM is
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(a) A \ B \ CD \ EFG \ H
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>and the segmentation from BMM is
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(b) A \ B \ C \ DE \ FG \ H
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We will take result (a), since it has fewer 
words. But if what we get from BMM is
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>(c) AB \ C \ DE \ FG \ H
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>We will take result (c), since the numbers 
of words is same in both method.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>After  the  segmentation  step  we  take  the  advantage  of 
JGAAP’s  features  and  add  different  event  sets  according  to 
the  characteristics  of  Chinese,  then  apply  statistical  analysis 
to  determine  the  ﬁ nal  results.  It  is  not  clear  at  this  writing, 
for example, if the larger character set of Chinese will make 
character-based methods more effective in Chinese then they 
are  in  other  languages  written  with  the  Latin  alphabet  (like 
English). It is also not clear whether the segmentation process 
will produce the same type of set of useful “function words” 
that are so useful in English authorship attribution. The JGAAP 
structure  (Juola  et  al,  2006;Juola  et  al.,  submitted),  however, 
will make it easy to test our system using a variety of different 
methods and analysis algorithms.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>   
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>In order to test the performance on Chinese of our software, 
we are in the process of constructing a Chinese test corpus. 
We  will  select  three  popular  novelists  and  ten  novels  from 
each one, eight novels from each author will be used as training 
data, the other two will be used as testing data. We will also 
test  on  the  blogs  which  will  be  selected  from  internet. The 
testing procedure will be the same as with the novels.
<<<<THIS IS A BOX>>>>This  research  demonstrates,  ﬁ rst,  the  JGAAP  structure  can 
easily be adapted to the problems of non-Latin scripts and not 
English languages, and second, provides somes cues to the best 
practices of authorship attribution in Chinese. It can hopefully 
be extended to the development of other non-Latin systems 
for authorship attribution.
