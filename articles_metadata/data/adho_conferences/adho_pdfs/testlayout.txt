All \nof  the  content  displayed  in  the  digital  edition  is  dynamically \ncreated from XML data. Output is produced through means of \nXSLT style sheets. This holds for the text section, the contents \noverview and the result lists. We have adopted this approach \nto  ensure  the  viability  of  our  data  for  as  long  a  period  as \npossible.  Both  digital  editions  have  been  optimized  for  use \nwith recent browser versions.

The most powerful \nand  effective  techniques  rely  on  the  abilities  of  systems  to \nclassify  documents  and  parts  of  documents,  often  in  binary \noppositions  (spam/not  spam,  male/female,  etc).  Features  of \ndocuments employed in machine learning applications tend to \nbe restricted to small subsets of available words, expressions \nor other textual attributes. Clustering of documents based on \nrelatively  small  feature  sets  into  a  small  and  often  arbitrary \nnumber of groups similarly tends to focus on broad patterns. \nLost in all of these operations are the marginal and exceptional, \nrendered  hidden  and  invisible  as  it  were,  in  classiﬁ cation \nschemes and feature selection.\n'><LTTextBoxHorizontal(10) 318.188,181.578,569.757,551.578 'Feature set selection is the ﬁ rst necessary step in many text \nmining tasks. Ian Witten notes that in “many practical situations \nthere are far too many attributes for learning schemes to handle, \nand  some  of  them  --  perhaps  the  overwhelming  majority  -\n-  are  clearly  irrelevant  or  redundant”  (286-7).  In  our  work, \nwe routinely reduce the number of features (words, lemmas, \nbigrams, etc) using a variety of techniques, most frequently by \nﬁ ltering out features which occur in a small subset of documents \nor instances. This selection process is further required to avoid \n“overﬁ tting” a learner to the training data. One could build an \neffective  classiﬁ er  and  train  it  using  features  that  are  unique \nto particular documents, but doing so would limit the general \napplicability of the tool. Attempting to classify French novels by \ngender of author while retaining the names of characters (as \nin Sand’s novel, Conseulo) or other distinctive elements is very \neffective, but says little about gendered writing in 19th century \nFrance (Argamon et. al., Discourse). Indeed, many classiﬁ cation \ntasks may be successful using a tiny subset of all of the words \nin a corpus. In examining American and non-American Black \nDrama,  we  achieved  over  90%  accuracy  in  classifying  over \nnearly 700 plays using a feature set of only 60 surface words \n(Argamon et. al., Gender, Race). Using a vector space similarity \nfunction to detect articles in the Encyclopédie which borrow \nsigniﬁ cantly from the Dictionnaire de Trévoux, we routinely get \nimpressive performance by selecting fewer than 1,000 of the \n400,000  unique  forms  in  the  two  documents  (Allen  et.  al.). \nThe requirement of greatly reductive feature set selection for \npractical text mining and the ability of the systems to perform \neffective classiﬁ cations based on even smaller subsets suggests \nthat  there  is  a  signiﬁ cant  distance  from  the  texts  at  which \nmachine learning must operate in order to be effective.\n'><LTTextBoxHorizontal(11) 56.693,37.892,566.930,271.165 'At the heart of most machine learning tools is some variety \nof  classiﬁ er.

Feature \nset selection is generally required in text mining in order to \nreduce the dimensionality of the “native feature space”, which \ncan  range  in  the  tens  or  hundreds  thousands  of  words  in \neven  modest  size  corpora  [Yang].
