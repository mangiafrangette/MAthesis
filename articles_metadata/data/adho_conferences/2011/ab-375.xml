                <h2></h2>
                <p class="noindent">A scholar or student who wishes to engage in ‘non-traditional’ authorship
                    attribution would be wise to choose a test corpus that is as free as possible of
                    ‘interfering’ features such as genre, external editing, or a corpus that is
                    stretched over a large number of years. The higher the consistency throughout
                    the corpus, the larger the chance of a successful investigation of authorship
                    and/or stylistic features.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Medieval manuscripts are characterized by a much greater amount of, what we could
                    call, ‘interfering’ features. Scribes manually copied texts again and again, not
                    seldom altering the content and often altering the orthography. Most original
                    works have been lost, just as much of the copied material. To add even more
                    difficulties, what we nowadays will easily refer to as ‘original work’ is much
                    less clear-cut in the Middle Ages. Our modern notion of ‘copyright’ is virtually
                    unknown to medieval men and women and for a long time the concept of auctoritas
                    (author) was primarily used in referral to classic writers such as Aristotle and
                    Augustine. Many of the medieval texts are thus written anonymously. </p>

                <p class="noindent">The situation could be characterized as chaotic by scholars used to relatively
                    straightforward text corpora. Before you can begin your quest for a medieval
                    author, you first have to find out what content is scribal related and what can
                    be attributed to the author. And just when you think you are making some
                    progress, you find out that your ‘author’ has been merely compiling source
                    texts, who he (or she) is copying word for word. A scholar addressing these
                    texts should therefore meticulously peal of the different layers of the text.
                    When confronted with these scenarios, it might not sound that surprising that
                    the number of studies involving the use of computational techniques and medieval
                    texts is not that great. In recent years though, some progress has been made
                    (e.g. Van Dalen-Oskam and Van Zundert 2007; Van Dalen-Oskam, Thaisen and
                    Kestemont 2010). Most of all, these studies show that it is possible – using
                    computational techniques such as Burrows’ Delta – to overcome some of the
                    difficulties in distinguishing for instance scribal and authorial layers within
                    a single text.</p>

            
            
                <h2>The Case</h2>
                <p class="noindent">In this paper I will contribute to this evolving field of research and discuss
                    some possible methods that can be used to differentiate these different layers
                    within medieval texts. Although the text corpus that I will be using originated
                    from fully tagged TEI/XML files, for this purpose I will be using plain text
                    files. This could be of great interest to scholars who are not able or not
                    willing to spend large amounts of time, energy and skill in preparing their
                    texts. The texts are transcribed without changing spelling to modern use (thus
                    euen instead of even and Iherusalem instead of Jherusalem), but abbreviated
                    words are expanded.</p>

                <p class="noindent">One of the more interesting aspects of this particular text corpus is that it has
                    been written by a single person, whose name is recorded in one of his charters:
                    Hendrik Gerardsz. van Vianen, most likely secretary of the Utrecht Land
                    Commander of the Teutonic Order. The Teutonic Order was one of the three major
                    military orders – beside the Knights Templars and Hospitallers – that defended
                    the Holy Church in the Holy Land, the Iberian Peninsula and the Baltic region
                    and received goods and land all over Europe, including the Low Countries.
                    Hendrik van Vianen wrote at least 25 Middle Dutch charters containing land
                    contracts for the Teutonic Order between 1479 and 1491. He also wrote a few
                    Latin charters between 1489 and 1509 that are not included in this study.
                    Furthermore, he manually copied a manuscript containing a Dutch version of the
                    popular Sachsenspiegel that belonged to two Land Commanders of the Teutonic
                    Order in Utrecht. Last but not least, he was responsible for a chronicle on the
                    history of the Teutonic Order, known as the Croniken van der Duytscher Oirden or
                    Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik (Stapel and Vollmann-Profe 2010). Codicological
                    evidence suggests that the manuscript of his hand, now in Vienna, is an
                    autograph, although it is not sure whether parts of the text existed before.
                    Autographs are relatively rare in a medieval context, a recent survey of Middle
                    Dutch manuscripts mentions barely more than a hundred examples (Houthuys
                    2009).</p>

                <p class="noindent">As a result, we have the unique opportunity to study a medieval text corpus –
                    perhaps not as large as the ones modern literary scholars work with, but still
                    substantial in medieval terms – of around 131.000 words that includes the work
                    of a single person working as manuscript scribe; writer of land charters; and
                    possible author of a history of his order.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Ever since the Croniken van der Duytscher Oirden has been studied in a scholarly
                    context, there have been questions about the original composition. The original
                    Middle Dutch version of the chronicle consists of a long prologue, a part that
                    contains the deeds and lives of the Grand Masters of the Order, alternated by
                    privileges granted by popes and emperors. It ends with a history of the regional
                    bailiwick of Utrecht and its Land Commanders. Especially that last part is often
                    put aside as a later addition to the chronicle. It is an interesting question,
                    the more so since it has historical significance in the sense that it has an
                    influence on the original function and aspiration of the text.</p>

            
            
                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p class="noindent">To examine the relationship between the different parts of the text corpus we
                    have collected, I employed several methods, but for now, I would like to focus
                    on the use of the Delta Spreadsheets, freely made available by David Hoover
                    (Hoover 2009). Some primary samples were selected from of the text corpus using
                    the Intelligent Archive (Craig, Whipp and Ralston 2010) to create word frequency
                    lists: the combined charters; the Sachsenspiegel; the table of contents of the
                    Croniken; its prologue; some of the privileges; three parts of the Grand
                    Masters’ part; and the bailiwick chronicle. These were computed against 2000
                    word pieces, overlapping and 500 words advancing. The results are shown in
                    Figures <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-375.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">1</a>, <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-375.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">2</a> and <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-375.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">3</a>. <p>

                <p class="noindent">What stands out is that in all three instances, the primary samples of the table
                    of contents and the bailiwick chronicle (in light and dark blue) outperform the
                    other samples, especially if one leaves out the samples in <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-375.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">Figure 3</a> which perform off course very well in their own
                    consecutive areas.</p>

            
            
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="noindent">What can be concluded from this observation? I think the table of content and the
                    bailiwick chronicle best describe the personal writing style and orthography of
                    Hendrik van Vianen. In both the charters, the copied Sachsenspiegel and the
                    Croniken this layer is present, and it raises the question if he indeed can be
                    held responsible for the bailiwick chronicle and the table of contents. The
                    table of contents is clearly written at a later stage, added at the end of
                    project, as is shown by watermark evidence and the distribution of some
                    abbreviations and specific letter forms, quantified in Figure <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-375.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">4</a> and <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-375.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">5</a> below.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Moreover, to what extent can Hendrik van Vianen still be held responsible for the
                    rest of the chronicle? Was there an older exemplar of a chronicle available to
                    him? It is hard to say for certain. There is a good possibility that he was not
                    so much the – what we would now call – author, but more a compiler for large
                    parts of the chronicle. The old source texts would then form another layer
                    within the text. Again, in the Middle Ages it is not always possible (and even
                    helpful) to make a strict distinction between the two. An old-fashioned approach
                    to research the sources of the chronicles and how these source-texts were
                    implemented could be a logical step further and will be one of the issues
                    addressed in the remainder of this project.</p>
