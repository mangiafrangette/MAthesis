                    Anderson, Deborah, 
                    <a href="mailto:dwanders@sonic.net">dwanders@sonic.net</a>
                    Department of Linguistics, UC Berkeley, 
                </h4><hr />
            
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="noindent">The challenge of how to handle glyph variants when encoding text has long been a
                    dilemma for those working with historical text materials. How can a digital
                    humanist specify a particular glyph of a Unicode character, even if the glyph
                    might be known to be an error? Is it possible to search for the character, and
                    find instances of the “error” glyphs? </p>
                <p class="noindent">This short paper addresses issues involving glyph variants, in light of recent
                    developments within the world of Unicode and W3C standardization, as well as
                    OpenType specifications (also an ISO standard). The different options for
                    handling glyph variants will also be explored in view of sustainability, and
                    viewed from the general perspective of the Unicode character encoding standard,
                    with particular discussion of Unicode variation sequences. </p>
            
            
                <h2>Gaiji</h2>
                <p class="noindent">One option available to text encoders is to use the “gaiji” module, a mark-up
                    mechanism described in TEI P5 which offers a means to represent and distinguish
                    specific characters and glyphs that the Unicode Standard considers as identical
                    (TEI Consortium, 2010). </p>
            
            
                <h2>Font-Based Option</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Another possibility is to request users view the text with a particular font, one
                    that contains the appropriate shape of the glyph(s). However, this is dependent
                    upon the user having a particular font installed. </p>
                <p class="noindent">Two recent developments affect this option:</p>
                
                    <li> A working group of W3C is developing a specification for “WebFonts,”
                        which will enable the automatic downloading and temporary installment of
                        fonts over the Web, so users don’t need to install fonts on their operating
                        systems. WebFonts is expected to be more widely deployed in the future; a
                        public working draft was published in late July 2010 (W3C, 2010). This would
                        apply to viewing text on Web browsers, and does not currently extend to word
                        processing documents. (Note: W3C also is refining the CSS3 fonts
                        module.)</li>
                    <li>A second development is the OpenType (OT) specification, which permits
                        alternate glyphs to be selected and displayed (Microsoft Typography, 2008a).
                        One drawback is that the person viewing the document must be using an
                        application that supports these OT features in order for the specific
                        alternate glyphs to appear. If the application does not support this
                        OpenType feature, the default glyph for the Unicode character will appear.
                        For example, the original author may have selected the shape “β” for U+03B2
                        GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA for his Greek text, but without the OpenType feature
                        support, the recipient’s application may display a beta in the default
                        shape, "ß".</li>
                
                <p class="noindent">OpenType also includes a way to specify specific glyph shapes that are commonly
                    used for certain language-specific letters. For example, there are specific
                    forms of italic and cursive Serbian letters that differ from Russian, although
                    they are the same Unicode characters. The OpenType “language system” table and
                    “locl” (localized form) feature table are mechanisms that allow one to specify
                    such variant glyphs. These features are activated by language tags (Microsoft
                    Typography, 2008b). However, as noted above, OpenType support – while becoming
                    more common - is still limited to certain applications, although it is an
                    international standard (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 [OFF] [ISO, 2011]).</p>
            
            
                <h2>Encode a Separate Character</h2>
                <p class="noindent">One option occasionally mentioned as a way to represent a particular variant in a
                    standardized way is to propose the variant as a separate character in Unicode.
                    Technically, this is not allowed, since one of the core design principles is:
                    “Unicode encodes characters, not glyphs” (Unicode Consortium, 2011a). However,
                    some variants have been included in Unicode if they were present in earlier
                    standards. The character/glyph model in CJK is particularly murky, in part due
                    to the sheer number of characters involved (approximately 75,616 characters or
                    69% of all graphic characters in Unicode 6.0 are CJK). For the historic East
                    Asian character sets, such as Classical Yi, the writing systems may be poorly
                    understood and there is a tendency to encode glyphs. As a result, some character
                    proposals have been based on glyphs (cf. the Classical Yi proposal, which
                    proposed 88,613 “characters” [China, 2007]). Despite this, requesting the
                    encoding of glyph variants into Unicode (as separate characters) is not
                    generally advisable. </p>
            
            
                <h2>Variation Sequence</h2>
                <p class="noindent">A last option is to specify a Unicode variation sequence which is defined as a
                    base character and a variation selector (Unicode Consortium, 2011b). This is a
                    standardized means to indicate the glyphic variants of the base character. The
                    advantage to this mechanism is that the variation is accessible in plain text,
                    and does not rely on code points in the Private Use Area, which are not
                    interoperable. </p>
                <p class="noindent">This particular mechanism has not yet been widely publicized amongst in the world
                    of digital humanities. It will likely become more widely supported in software,
                    particularly as the Japanese government will be using variation sequences to
                    handle rare ideographs used in proper names and place names, rather than
                    proposing 2,621 new “compatibility” characters (Japan , 2009). In 2010, the
                    Japan National Body put forward a large collection of ideographic variation
                    sequences, which have been under review (Unicode Consortium, 2010a). </p>
                <p class="noindent">Variation selectors have been mentioned as a way to handle variants for several
                    historic scripts, namely Tangut and Manichaean. For Tangut, a historic script
                    used in China until the 16c, the variation sequences were suggested as a way to
                    handle cases where the lexical sources don’t agree (that is, there is
                    disagreement whether a given glyph is a variant of a character or is a separate
                    character), as a way to document when different scholarly opinions on
                    unifications, and to address backwards compatibility issues (Cook and Lunde,
                    2008). </p>
                <p class="noindent">In Manichaean, the variation selectors are mentioned as a way to indicate
                    alternate forms which are not predictable, either by their position in a word,
                    or in a line. The use of the variation sequences maintains the basic character
                    identity (Everson et al., 2009). </p>
                <p class="noindent">Figure 1 is an example showing the proposed shape for the Manichaean HE glyph,
                    and the HE with Variation Selector-1. (<a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-328.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">See
                        Figure 1</a>) </p>
                <p class="noindent">One drawback is that the variation sequences need to be proposed and approved by
                    the Unicode Consortium, much as new characters are (or, for ideographic
                    sequences, are reviewed as part of the Unicode Public Review Process). However,
                    this hurdle will ensure the characters are standardized, and are publicly
                    accessible (Unicode Editorial Committee Members, 2011; Unicode Consortium,
                    2010b). </p>
                <p class="noindent">Another benefit is that search queries can ignore the variation selectors or the
                    query can be written to only match a term with a specific variation selector.
                    This mechanism could be useful as a way to display glyph errors, and be able to
                    relate them to the base character. However, if a given application does not
                    support variation sequences, the base character will display by default. </p>
                <p class="noindent">Variation sequences provide a standards-based option, which has some advantages
                    over font-based alternatives. However, to date, relatively few variation
                    sequences have been defined, except for those used in mathematics, Mongolian,
                    and the historic script Phags-Pa (Unicode Editorial Committee Members, 2011). </p>
                <p class="noindent">At present, Ideographic Variation Sequences are only supported in the certain
                    environments (Acrobat/Reader 9.0 and higher, Flash Player 10 and higher,
                    InDesign CS4 and higher, Mac OS X 10.6 and higher, Windows 7 and higher, and
                    Firefox 4 on all platforms [Lunde, 2011]). The dependency on limited
                    implementations can pose a problem for digital humanists, however, if future
                    software fails to support these variation sequences. </p>
            
            
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="noindent">In sum, several alternatives are available to text encoders to specify variant
                    glyphs in text at present. This paper has provided new information on different
                    options, which are still developing and may become more widely adopted,
                    affecting choices available to text encoders. </p>
                <p class="noindent">This author cautiously recommends the use of Variation Selectors if the glyph
                    difference needs to be captured in plain-text, and the digital encoder is
                    willing to go through the approval process to get the variation sequence
                    approved by the standards committees. </p>
