                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="noindent">This paper describes the methodology used in the creation of digital chapters and
                    subsequent recreation of digital entities or objects derived, modified,
                    transformed and visualised from XML encoded scholarship. It considers the
                    changing function of traditional printed theses and how the use of technologies
                    affects the representation and functions of graduate digital scholarship.</p>
                <p class="noindent">This paper is based upon the working methodologies of two PhD theses.
                    Specifically, Webb’s thesis examines the creation of factlets and subsequent
                    visualisation of factoids, which inform not only the source information and
                    encoding but also the development and completion of historical research outputs.
                    These outputs, supported by XML, XQuery and factlets, demonstrate the use of
                    digital technology as an essential feature of humanities research and its
                    methodologies. Teehan’s thesis reflects upon current digital representation
                    models for pre-existing sources relevant to humanities research. Focusing on
                    transactional, or functional, documents, it proposes a methodology for
                    contextually modeling and XML-encoding those resources, using established
                    software engineering and computer science paradigms such as Use Case analysis
                    and UML modeling, which foreground the User. Both theses examine procedures and
                    strategies for conducting humanities research using digital tools and
                    applications. Thus, this paper is central to a reflective and reflexive process
                    resulting from, and in, the critical self-evaluation of the theses and their
                    outputs.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Traditionally, research outputs codified as chapters or sections can be seen as
                    the final manifestation of a PhD thesis and reflect the use of print or static
                    technology. The functionality of these outputs varies according to different
                    headings and ranges from literature reviews, general narrative and concept
                    generation, to the development of structured arguments based on theory and
                    source material, to the provision of essential referencing and bibliographic
                    material. These functions are referred to as “generic characteristics of
                    academic discourse” (Mingwei, 2010) in linguistic structural analysis. Chapter
                    functionality represents and reflects the original research statement and
                    provides the means to convey and articulate traditional scholarship within the
                    medium of print. The use of XML, and XSLT, along with the provision of software
                    libraries, creates a framework to add dynamic functionality to an otherwise
                    static text. “Generic characteristics” (Mingwei, 2010) are encoded, which enable
                    the use of the described framework.</p>
                <p class="noindent">This approach reflects the innate capability of the digital medium to layer extra
                    functionality over the restricted functionality of printed works. Rather than
                    creating just a single representation of scholarly output, the use of XSLT and
                    software libraries generates and encourages a reflexive process between text,
                    argument, narrative and source material.</p>
                <p class="noindent">These methods change reader and user activity - one user may be a reader while
                    another may have access to an interactive environment. Different user roles and
                    environments transform the user from a passive participant to an active one. The
                    realisation of various use cases enables the user to do more than just read the
                    text and this activity realises the importance of data reusability.</p>

                <h2>Stage 1 - Defining the Use Cases, Creating the Model, Encoding the
                    Source</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Text is innately encoded with semantics and functionality and each chapter or
                    section in a piece of scholarship establishes or conveys various essential
                    processes in the life of a text. These processes consist of deduction, concept
                    development, narrative, consequence, etc., and it is these “lexical relations”
                    (Eggins, 2004) within a text which develop specific research statements. Other
                    bibliographic properties of a section are concrete rather than abstract and
                    provide essential functionality e.g. references, footnotes, paragraphs and
                    titles.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Despite these multiple perspectives, transformation of a born-digital text (a
                    thesis) into both the print and digital media relies upon the existence of a
                    single, defining text-model. Figure 1 shows the process involved in creating new
                    research objects. The first stage makes possible all subsequent processes;
                    creating a unifying model allows the generation of XML schema and subsequent XML
                    encoding in order to manifest the new research objects (the various chapters in
                    a research thesis). The model is driven by specific Use Cases such as the
                    production of both a static printed version of the text, and an interactive
                    digital version.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The source chapters are encoded at the final stages of the research process,
                    rather than during the writing process. The model considers both presentation
                    properties (chapter, paragraph, section), which allows for transformations
                    specifically for presentation purposes, and semantic properties which encode the
                    “textual semantics” (Eggins, 2004) of the text, its logical class (Teehan,
                    2010). This approach makes the text reusable and ensures “a single lexical can
                    function very differently” (Landow, 2006) in different environments.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The model is translated into a schema which allows us to mark up the content of
                    the scholarship, including narrative which in historical research pertains to
                    ‘logical’ rather than ‘ideological’ content. We view narrative as the logical
                    information contained in the text that contributes to a narrative of the past
                    (Coffin, 2002). The encoding of dynamic narrative and data supports the creation
                    of new research outputs as non-linear components derived from the text.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Stages 2 and 3 - Realising Use Cases</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Stage 2 and 3 are the realisation of the various Use Cases. The XSLT transforms
                    and software libraries are templates from which different text from different
                    sources can be modified and transformed, in effect creating a suite of
                    tools.</p>
                <p class="noindent">These various macros are supporting tools for manifestations of a text. Our
                    encoded texts depict the various functions embedded in standard print theses,
                    but augment those capabilities for these born-digital theses. Here, two specific
                    Use Cases address (i) the creation of a dynamic bibliographic referencing model,
                    and (ii) the context-dependent presentation of boundary
                    objects.</p>
                <p class="noindent">A referencing model in XSLT can automatically create a dynamic bibliography for a
                    chapter with features including “intertextual links” (Samraj, 2008) between the
                    text and source material. Software libraries can be used to support the innate
                    variability of a boundary object, which is defined as an object with user
                    dependent functionality and meaning (Thomas). Thus, depending on the User’s
                    activity and perspective, the presentation of the boundary object will change;
                    for instance, a table diagram, static in the print version, may become
                    interactive within a digital context.</p>
                <p class="noindent">These low-level Use Cases support our higher level one; dynamic creation of
                    static or interactive versions of a base text-model. The print model transforms
                    the original text to a print ready text, and can account for various
                    institutional templates. Embedding references to the various primary sources
                    used in the XML encoding instructs an XSLT to create a hypertext of linked
                    resources and creates “intertextual links” (Samraj, 2008) and boundary objects
                    for user interaction between the narrative and various digital objects within
                    the digital medium. <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-370.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">Figure 2</a>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="noindent">This paper demonstrates the process and production of support tools for digital
                    scholarship, and how the creation of appropriate templates can make manifest
                    various representations of Digital Humanities PhD theses from a single model.
                    The Use Cases are reliant on the ability of the encoding and the schema to
                    encapsulate both the functions of the text and the various transformations and
                    software libraries. Figure 2 demonstrates the interactions between the encoded
                    text, the transformations and the outputs.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Current research students in Digital Humanities constitute a newly ‘born digital’
                    generation, the nature of whose outputs differs markedly from earlier
                    generations. Reflections on this changing process should also include an
                    analysis of new methods and techniques to create dynamic scholarship. The
                    encoding of the final phase in a PhD thesis allows scholarship to be reused,
                    modified, visualised and transformed, allowing for greater distribution and
                    accessibility of digital scholarship. Thus the dissertation, in its multiple
                    representations, can not only remain central to the discipline of Digital
                    Humanities but shape its future development.</p>
