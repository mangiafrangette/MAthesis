				<h2></h2>
				<p class="noindent">This paper will report on the first eighteen months of a 3-year grant funded by
					the <i>Fonds québecois de la recherche sur la société et la
						culture</i> led by playwright Patrick Leroux (overseeing the creative
					component) and Michael Eberle-Sinatra (overseeing the academic component). The
					specific nature of this group project is nestled in the promising dialogue to be
					established between Romantic literature scholars, a theatre practitioner, and a
					scholar preoccupied with the pedagogy of Romantic drama using hypermedia as a
					template and an engaging interface.</p>

				<p class="noindent">When artists teach, they never quite relinquish their initial creative impulse.
					Historical works, while being taught for their intrinsic value and larger
					pertinence within a literary context, nevertheless solicit a resonant response.
					Classroom exercises in both academic and creative courses suggest that many
					students engage in a similar empathic manner when allowed to prod, question, and
					interact actively with a studied text.</p>

				<p class="noindent">The “creative” component of this research-creation project with strong
					pedagogical intent is precisely linked to an artistic response to the source
					text, Joanna Baillie’s <i>Witchcraft</i>. In addition to the
					edited text, its scholarly annotations and commentary, and the filmed Finborough
					production of the play, we will create workshop situations with actors and
					students in which the play will be explored in rehearsal prompting us to
					investigate other manners of staging the work and illustrating, through filmed
					documentation, the <i>process of reading a text for
						performance</i>. Short video presentations of key creative and interpretive
					issues will be edited for inclusion in the hypermedia presentation. The actual
					process, whether filmed or not, will allow the actors and creative faculty to
					fully immerse themselves in Baillie’s world and work in order to fuel their
					resonant responses to them.</p>

				<p class="noindent">This second creative component, the <i>resonant response</i>,
					will take the form of short theatrical pieces conceived for film. The nuance is
					essential as the pieces will not be short cinematic films but rather
					short-filmed theatrical pieces. The emphasis on speech, dramatic action, and
					relationship to a defined theatrical space will differentiate these pieces from
					more intimate, image-based cinematic pieces. The resonant responses could be as
					short as two minutes or as long as ten minutes, in order to fully explore very
					precise formal issues (a character’s speech, the subtext in a given dialogue,
					what we couldn’t stage during the 19th Century but feel we could now). These
					creative pieces will be developed with Theatre, Creative Writing, and English
					literature students and faculty.</p>

				<p class="noindent">Existing TEI guidelines for scholarly encoding do not account for the unique
					relationship between a play script and performance practice and history.
					Scholarly encoding typically views the structures of texts in relation to the
					protocols that guide how readers interpret documents. But dramatic scripts
					require different kinds of reading and, thus, different kinds of encoding.
					Performance-informed inquiry into play texts depends on a reader’s ability to
					think about the range of possibilities—both historically distant and
					contemporary—for theatricalization of a line of dialogue, a bit of physical
					action, or a visual space.</p>

				<p class="noindent">Additional historical materials on the theatre and culture of Baillie’s era will
					be provided by team members. For our hypermedia resource to organize multi-media
					materials in ways that will help students in literature classes to use the
					hypermedia edition of the play, we will need to develop innovative
					customizations of TEI encoding guidelines. Discovering how best to support a
					student reader’s work with a historically unfamiliar dramatic work provides an
					important test case for existing guidelines for XML encoding of drama.</p>
				<p class="noindent">This project will take an innovative approach in several senses. It will use
					hypermedia to try to solve a classroom problem created by plays with little
					performance history or connection to familiar theatrical styles. It will also
					test the limitations of the TEI scholarly encoding guidelines by exploring how,
					in the case of play scripts, building hypermedia resources requires creative,
					user-oriented strategies of encoding. The research-creation program will
					illustrate how contemporary artists can engage with historical works, while
					shedding light onto the theatrical creative process. Finally, our <i>Resonant Response</i> to Joanna Baillie’s Drama will combine
					scholarly research on Romantic drama, practice-driven analysis, the creation of
					new work, and hypermedia expertise.</p>

				<p class="noindent">This particular research-creation program is singular and innovative in its
					combination of academic close reading, dramaturgical analysis, dramatic writing
					and theatrical performance, filmed theatre, and a resolutely pedagogical
					preoccupation with a full and thorough exploration of the possibilities of
					hypermedia edition.</p>

				<p class="noindent">In addition to creating a prototype hypermedia edition, the project seeks to find
					out: 
						<li>what value performance annotations can add to a teacher’s work with
							students on a seldom-performed play;</li>
						<li>how the Text Encoding Initiative’s (TEI) scholarly encoding guidelines
							can best be customized to design hypermedia play editions;</li>
						<li>how the process of collaboration among faculty and students in
							humanities and communications disciplines can enrich understanding of
							technology’s interaction with interpretation.</li>
