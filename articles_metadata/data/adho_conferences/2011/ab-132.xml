				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p class="noindent">The growing amount of digital texts and tools is slowly but definitely changing
					the way literary scholars design their research. This paper will describe the
					effects for one research topic: ‘literary onomastics’, the study of the usage
					and functions of names in literary texts. Research in literary onomastics
					usually is qualitative in nature and focuses on 'significant' names in literary
					texts. No quantitative or comparative studies have been published yet. Several
					researchers, however, have pointed out that names can only be called significant
					if they are studied in the context of all the names - the so-called 'onymic
					landscape' - in a text, oeuvre, genre etc. (e.g. Sobanski 1998). This question
					is comparative by nature and implies the wish for a more quantitative,
					computer-assisted approach.</p>
			
			
				<h2>Research questions</h2>
				<p class="noindent">As to name usage, first we have to find out what is normal. We want to know how
					many name forms usually occur in a novel, and how many of these are personal
					names, place names, and other names. As to name functions, a useful disctinction
					is between plot internal and plot external names. Plot internal names refer to
					characters, places or other entitities which only ´exist´ in the fiction of the
					story. Plot external names refer to persons, places or other entities which are
					known to exist or to have existed in the real world. Most place names are plot
					external, referring to real countries, cities, streets, etc. and thus have a
					reality enhancing function. In fantasy novels, however, place names are usually
					fictional and thus plot internal, enhancing the unreality, the fantasy of the
					story. Plot external personal names seem to function as characterizations of the
					fictional characters, describing e.g. their political or cultural preferences. </p>
				<p class="noindent">It is expected that different authors, genres, time periods or even languages
					apply these different types and functions in different ways, showing different
					trends which we want to discover in what we like to call comparative literary
					onomastics (Van Dalen-Oskam 2005, 2006). The ultimate aim of the research is to
					develop a method to compare the name usage and functions on as large a scale as
					possible, explicitly also across languages. So what is needed to do that?</p>
			
			
				<h2>Method and corpus</h2>
				<p class="noindent">The amount of names in a text can be expressed in the percentage of the total
					amount of tokens in the text. For that, we need digital texts of fair to good
					quality. To tag all the names, we need named entity recognition and
					classification (NERC) tools. Different forms of the same name (e.g. <i>Patrick</i> and <i>Patrick's</i>) need to be
					grouped by a <i>lemma</i> (PATRICK in this case). Different
					name forms for the same person or place need to get the same <i>identification</i> (e.g. the name <i>Alfred</i> and the name <i>Issendorf</i> both belong to
					the character identified as <i>ALFRED ISSENDORF</i>). To find
					out whether we can compare the resulting percentages across languages, we
					focused on a corpus of modern Dutch and English novels and their translations
					into the other language. We found we have to include two other levels of
					aggregation: <i>mentions</i> and <i>name
						tokens</i>. Mentions are occurrences of a name irrespective of the number
					of tokens used. So several name tokens can be used in one mention. This
					distinction is necessary because different languages have different tokenization
					rules. The Dutch personal name <i>Gerrit-Jan</i>, e.g., with a
					hyphen and therefore counted as one token, is translated in English as <i>Gerrit Jan</i>, resulting in two tokens. Our corpus consists
					of 22 Dutch and 22 English novels, added with the translation into the other
					language of ten in each group.</p>
			
			
				<h2>Theory and practice</h2>
				<p class="noindent">Comparative research can only be done when many scholars collaborate. We will
					have to make sure that all those scholars encode their texts in the same way,
					considering the same tokens as names. This may sound easy, but it is not. Even
					name theorists have different definitions of what a name is (Van Langendonck
					2007). Guidelines had to be set. We decided to limit the tagging to the
					'prototypical' names, so those names that are considered names by readers in
					general. Something is a name if it refers to a unique person, place, or object.
					So we excluded currencies, days of the week, months, etc. For cases leading to
					discussion we defined additional rules.</p>
				<p class="noindent">We found that not many modern novels are digitally available yet. Furthermore,
					NERC tools proved to be not good enough yet and are using partly different
					categories than our research needs (Sekine and Ranchod 2009). This meant much
					more manual work than we expected. The tagging and the statistics are now done
					by means of several perl scripts written by André van Dalen and an ingenious
					Excelsheet with macros designed by David Hoover. These tools can be seen as a
					prototype for the webservices we need for this type of comparative stylistic
					research.</p>
			
			
				<h2>Results (selection)</h2>
				<p class="noindent">In Figure 1, the percentage of name tokens in a set of novels is shown. The
					selection of novels in this graph consist of sixteen novels of which fifteen are
					Dutch and one is (American-)English (<i>Of the Farm</i>), added
					with the English translation of one of the Dutch novels (<i>The
						Twin</i>, translation of <i>Boven is het stil</i>).</p>
				<p>
					<h2>Fig. 1</h2>
					<img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//132/figure1.png" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-132.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//132/figure1.png','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
				</p>
				<p class="noindent">The graph gives as a first impression that we can expect around 2-3 percent of
					the tokens in a novel to be names. For this small selection, it is noteworthy
					that the four novels with the highest percentages (around 5 percent) are all
					books for children or young adults. Furthermore, the English novels do not show
					up in extreme positions compared to the other ones.</p>
				<p class="noindent"> Figure 2 gives more insight in the role of plot internal versus plot external
					names in the same set of novels. The novels are presented in the same order as
					in Fig. 1. We can see that the four books for children/young adults are still
					exeptional in the percentage of plot internal names. We also find that three of
					them have a rather small amount of plot external name tokens. </p>
				<p>
					<h2>Fig. 2</h2>
					<img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//132/figure2.png" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-132.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//132/figure2.png','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
				</p>
				<p class="noindent">The paper will present the case of names in Gerbrand Bakker’s novel <i>Boven is het stil / The Twin</i>. Dutch readers have the
					impression that the novel does not contain many names, while readers of the
					English translation have the opposite impression and point out that especially
					geographical names abound. The comparative computational approach shows that
					both reader groups are correct <i>and</i> wrong at the same
					time. The novel has around 2% of name tokens, which is at the lower end of what
					seems to be normal. But in the amount of <i>different</i> names
					(lemmas), geographical names (place names) do have a special role when we look
					at the ratio between personal names and place names (Figure 3). The trend here
					is that a novel contains more different personal names than place names. In only
					two cases (<i>Boven is het stil</i> and its translation <i>The Twin</i>, and <i>Fenrir</i>) a novel has
					more different place names. This suggests that place names have an extra
					stylistic function in these two novels. It will be shown in which ways place
					names function in the Bakker novel and how this analysis enriches the
					understanding of the novel <i>and</i> of the stylistic
					possibilities of place names for an author.</p>
				<p>
					<h2>Fig. 3</h2>
					<img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//132/figure3.png" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-132.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//132/figure3.png','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
				</p>
				<p class="noindent">We could only show a small part of all interesting observations to be made about
					the usage of names in a corpus of modern Dutch and English novels. But these
					first results make us anxious for more, in the expectation that this approach
					may lead to an acceptable method for a.o. across language comparison of
					stylistic elements. </p>
			
			
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p class="noindent">We conclude that the preliminary results are sufficiently interesting to go into
					the stylistic analysis of name usage and functions in novels more deeply. Names
					also seem promising stylistic elements for a comparison across languages. The
					currently available tools which could be expected to be helpful for this type of
					research, proved to be insufficient. We therefore plan to develop a set of
					interrelated webservices which will assist the scholar in the recognition,
					categorization, further tagging, and statistical analysis of names in
					novels.</p>
