                <p class="noindent">The digital humanities community lost a good friend and colleague with the death
                    of Chuck Bush, long-time Treasurer of the Association for Computers and
                    Humanities and an unfailingly warm presence at the annual digital humanities
                    conference which he attended with his wife, Junola. Chuck was trained as a
                    linguist and worked at Brigham Young University as a Senior Research Consultant
                    in the Humanities Technology and Research Support Center, where he often
                    explored his interests in both print and electronic publishing. He was one of
                    the early advocates for Humanities Computing education, as he both administered
                    and taught in the Computers and the Humanities Program. Humanities faculty at
                    BYU will remember Chuck for his kind and dedicated assistance with arcane
                    computer issues, as well as for his enthusiasm and unfailingly pleasant
                    manner.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Chuck served for more than 20 years on the ACH Executive Council, and for those
                    of us who worked closely with him during that time he was a constant source of
                    calm good sense, humor, and organizational memory. An absolutely trustworthy
                    steward for the ACH during its slowly rising fortunes, Chuck played a crucial
                    role in managing the ACH's alliance with ADHO in 2005-6 and in helping the
                    organization through a challenging transitional time. He could be counted on to
                    suggest a helpful compromise, clarify a tricky point, or bring a discussion down
                    to earth-he was never rattled or partisan.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Chuck was not given to self-display, but he had a great and subtle wit even in
                    routine email. He was principled without imposing on others. With his particular
                    dedication to supporting younger scholars and education, he was a strong
                    champion of the ACH and ADHO bursary programs, and as ACH Treasurer he had the
                    pleasure each year of handing out checks in a worthy cause. Those of us who met
                    him annually for meetings and a conference will remember him with great
                    affection, taking off his glasses in a meditative way before offering his
                    thoughts. He will be much missed and warmly remembered by all.</p>
