				<p class="noindent">From teaching students how to vet online websites, to formal peer review of
					digital publications, to evaluation of scholarship for tenure review, the need
					for a rigorous methodology to evaluate digital historical representations has
					never been more apparent. Sophisticated databases, digital libraries and
					archives, and virtual reconstructions have collectively reshaped engagement with
					the past that has challenged the boundaries of traditional historical practices.
					University professors encourage students to create mash-ups of historical
					multimedia content to be posted as YouTube documentaries. Museums employ mobile
					applications enriched with augmented reality to draw visitors further into an
					exhibition. Geospatial visualizations and virtual architectural reconstructions
					bring the past alive and challenge entrenched scholarly and popular
					perceptions.</p>

				<p class="noindent">While attention and resources have (justifiably) been focused on content creation
					and tool development, the digital history community has, until recently,
					neglected the development of a methodology that can evaluate digital work while
					meeting the needs of this shifting landscape. This has begun to change, as
					leading scholars in digital history have taken up the clarion call for reform of
					the peer review process. The perception is that peer review has become outdated
					and stagnant, promoting conservative scholarship while also failing to exploit
					more dynamic means of communication and commentary through social media and Web
					2.0 technologies. Robert B. Townsend, in a American Historical Association (AHA)
					blog posting proclaims, “The challenge lies in developing new forms of peer
					review better fitted to the online environment, both before publication (in the
					development and assessment stage) and after publication (as a means of
					validating the value and quality of the work).” Robert B. Townsend.

					or methodology that would bring together the interests and special knowledge of
					multiple disciplines.</p>

				<p class="noindent"> In my DH2010 presentation, “Thinking Archivally: Selection, Search, and

						presentation may be found online in the conference program. <i>Digital Humanities 2010: Conference Abstracts</i>. Eds.

						Accessed 13 March 2011. An expanded version of the paper will appear in a
						forthcoming issue of <i>American Archivist</i>.
					Digital historiography is the interdisciplinary assessment of digital historical
					representations across diverse formats. It promotes the rigorous and coherent
					use, recombination, and presentation of historical information through digital
					technologies. Digital historiography also accounts for the increased reliance on
					complex information systems to organize and represent historical data. The
					merging of historiography with archival theory and new media studies – along
					with numerous other fields such as museum studies, information science, and
					other humanities disciplines – ensures a comprehensive examination of a
						representation.For a history and examination of the contemporary
						“divide” between the historical and archival professions, see Francis X.
						Blouin, Jr. and William Rosenberg. <i>Processing the Past:
							Contesting Authorities in History and the Archives</i>. Oxford
						University Press (2011).</p>

				<p class="noindent">Three fundamental areas of archival theory were raised in last year’s
					presentation as fundamental to unlocking the trustworthiness and soundness of a
					representation: content selection, search functionality, and metadata. Through a
					series of illustrative examples of historical representations it was shown that
					these areas convey a representation’s historical contextualization, where
					context is defined as the formal and humanistic relationships among data and
					resources. For an introduction to the relationship of archival theory and
						context, see for example, Jennifer Meehan, "Towards an Archival Concept of
						Evidence," <i>Archivaria</i> 61(2006), 143. The discussion
						of archival context has been subsumed in a larger, more general area
						referred to as “information as evidence.” For further discussion of this
						concept, see Terry Cook, "Archival Science and Postmodernism: New
						Formulations for Old Concepts," <i>Archival Science</i>
						1(2001); Terry Cook, "What Is Past Is Prologue: A History of Archival Ideas
						since 1898, and the Future Paradigm Shift," <i>Archivaria</i> 43(1997); Margaret Hedstrom, "Archives, Memory, and
						Interfaces with the Past," <i>Archival Science</i> 2, no.
						1-2 (2002); Joanna Sassoon, "Beyond Chip Monks and Paper Tigers: Towards a
						New Culture of Archival Format Specialists," <i>Archival
							Science</i> 7, no. 2 (2007); Jennifer Meehan, "Making the Leap from
						Parts to Whole: Evidence and Inference in Archival Arrangement and
						Description," <i>American Archivist</i> 72, no. 1
						(2009).</p>

				<p class="noindent">Whereas last year’s paper focused on the theoretical underpinning of digital
					historiography, this year’s presentation will provide a programmatic framework
					that scholars, archivists, librarians, curators, editors and technical
					specialists may adapt and apply to their own work. There are already a number of
					promising developments underway in establishing a set of guidelines and
					practices for digital humanities evaluation, particularly in literature;
					nonetheless, a similar approach in digital history has been
						lacking.Perhaps the most comprehensive guide to evaluating digital
						scholarship can be found with the MLA Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly
						Editions. Section V is devoted to electronic scholarly editions, and prompts
						reviewers to consider elements of a digital work such as TEI encoding and
						the user interface. An NEH-funded Summer Institute entitled “Evaluating
						Digital Scholarship” will be hosted by NINES at the University of Virginia
						30 May – 3 June 2011, which will expand upon a one-day workshop held at
						Digital Humanities 2010 in London.</p>

				<p class="noindent">This paper will provide a guide to evaluating digital historical representations
					using a series of exploratory questions. The following questions may provide an
					entry point with which to kick-start an analysis. It should be noted that these
					questions do not evoke clear-cut responses, but rather require deeper
					interpretation of the representation: 
						<li>Is the representation’s historical content comprehensive or
							representative of the period/event/issue in question?</li>
						<li>How do metadata schema and other descriptive information shape the
							interpretative possibilities of the representation?</li>
						<li>What capacity does the user have to repurpose historical data for
							additional study? To what extent does a user have sufficient contextual
							information such as the content’s provenance to conduct such
							repurposing?</li>
						<li>How does the user search or navigate within the representation? In
							what ways does the interface facilitate or prohibit advanced humanistic
							inquiry?</li>
					 These questions apply a combination of historical and archival
					understanding to address a representation’s approach to selection, search, and
					metadata. At a more general level, they suggest the need within digital
					historiography to develop a peer review methodology that examines the <i>intersection</i> of technological and humanistic components
					of a representation.</p>
			


			
				<h2>A Three-Axis Framework for Peer Review</h2>

				<p class="noindent">This paper will propose, based on the sample questions above, three interlocking
					axes for a peer review methodology: Historical Content, User Experience, and
					Creator Intent. Critiques of digital representations have all too often isolated
					one axis at the expense of considering the others. Scientifically driven user or
					human-computer interaction studies may overlook the unquantifiable nuances of
					historical contextualization. Similarly, an analysis of content often neglects a
					representation’s user interface and how it may affect information access.
					Perhaps the most disregarded of the three areas is the creator’s intent for
					constructing a digital historical representation. In the fierce competition for
					funding in the digital humanities, developers must be able to justify their
					resource-intensive project, which raises basic questions surrounding the
					representation’s purpose and its contribution to historical scholarship or
					programming.</p>
				<p class="noindent">For the purpose of demonstrating how to apply digital historiography to peer
					review, a single digital historical representation will be selected and the
					audience will be guided through a brief, yet systematic evaluation. In terms of
					historical content, we will consider the representation’s engagement with
					relevant scholarship. Although a digital representation’s format may seem to
					belie traditional modes of historiography, it will be argued that a
					representation’s demonstrated recognition of historiographic trends is essential
					for establishing whether it advances new areas of historical understanding.
					Unlike a text-based monograph, analysis of content depends on the capacity of
					the user to <i>generate</i>, not just consume, plausible
					knowledge; therefore, peer review may focus more on the questions that may be
					posed through a representation rather than the construction of a single
					argument.</p>
				<p class="noindent">In terms of user experience, this presentation will focus on the question of
					access to historical content. More than just a scientific optimization of
					keywords, a reviewer must consider the user experience as a culmination of
					design features, tool functionality, and search capability. This raises issues
					regarding the application of standards and best practices. The selection of an
					appropriate metadata schema or digitization standard will determine a
					representation’s interoperability with other resources, which will in turn
					influence historiographic assessment. </p>
				<p class="noindent">Finally, consideration of authorial intent, embedded within elements such as a
					site’s introductory statement or contextual essays, provides a third axis that
					can anchor both a representation’s content and user experience. The core
					question to be considered here will be the representation’s intended or
					anticipated audience. Digital technology has enhanced access to historical
					knowledge for a wider public, which has placed additional responsibility on the
					part of the creator to consider how historical information is selected,
					presented, and most importantly, handled by diverse types of users. </p>
			


			
				<h2>The Benefits of Peer Review to Digital History</h2>

				<p class="noindent">A peer review system that follows shared and accepted standards and methodology
					may have significant benefits for advancing digital historical scholarship and
					digital humanities infrastructure in general.For further discussion of how
						the digital humanities must re-consider infrastructural needs, see Christine
						L. Borgman. “The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the
						Humanities.” Digital Humanities Quarterly. Fall 2009. Volume 3, Number
						4 Representations may be assessed on the merits of content and
					usability. In terms of scholarship, digital historiography may liberate scholars
					and developers to consider how to harness technologies in service of historical
					inquiry when all too often the reverse seems to hold true. The time for
					experimentation for its own sake has passed, and we should begin to consider how
					technology might contribute to more sustainable development of innovative modes
					of scholarship.</p>
				<p class="noindent">This presentation is not intended to provide a fixed method for peer review;
					rather it will encourage a revival of humanities-driven interpretative analysis
					that addresses central areas of scholarship, audience, argument, and most
					importantly, inquiry. Peer review must be contingent on the unique set of
					questions related to a representation’s subject area and formal qualities. Those
					in attendance will have the opportunity to take away a set of general questions
					that they may use to devise their own review criteria, or that may stimulate
					further dialogue about the peer review process. Perhaps most significantly, this
					presentation will defend the need for collaborative, transparent review that
					brings together subject and technical specialists, which can spark evaluation of
					noteworthy digital work that continues to elude mainstream academic
						recognition.The thoughts and ideas expressed in this paper are
						entirely my own and do not reflect those of the National Endowment for the
						Humanities or any other federal agency.</p>
