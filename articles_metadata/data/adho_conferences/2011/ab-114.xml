        <p class="noindent">This tutorial will introduce participants to XForms, viewed as a technology for building
          customized editors for XML documents.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Originally developed as a replacement for conventional HTML forms, XForms is designed to
          work well in the Web browser, allowing forms to be specified using the familiar facilities
          of XHTML and CSS. XForms is based on the model/view/controller architecture, and because
          the model being operated upon consists of a set of XML documents, XForms provides a
          convenient basis for developing custom tools for working with XML documents. With XForms,
          it becomes feasible for projects to develop vocabulary- and task-specific editors for use
          within the project. For suitably chosen tasks, specialized tools of this kind can require
          less training and provide better task support than full XML editors; it is thus easier to
          allow domain experts to examine and modify XML encoding, and routine tasks can be
          performed more quickly and reliably.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Any project making systematic use of XML will involve a number of tasks requiring
          systematic changes to XML documents, which may be more easily handled using XForms than
          with other techniques. For example: 
            <li>The samples in the language corpus have been divided into sentences using a
              probabilistic recognizer for sentence boundaries; we need to check to make sure that
              all the boundaries proposed by the software are in fact real sentence boundaries, and
              that no sentence boundaries have been missed.</li>
            <li>The text has been processed by a named-entity recognition engine and phrases have
              been marked up as personal names, clan names, place names, names of organizations, and
              other names, but the process by which this has happened is not fully trusted; we would
              like a specialist in the period and genre to check that the distinctions among place
              names, clan names, and personal names have been drawn correctly.</li>
            <li>Each of the seven hundred short documents in the project must be checked for
              conformance to the project's new rules for hyperlinks, and problems need to be flagged
              (not fixed, just flagged for later re-work).</li>
            <li>In a software development project, we have developed a set of XML-encoded test
              cases which the software should be able to handle. We have now realized that each test
              case needs to include metadata of a kind not originally foreseen. It needs to be added
              manually (or perhaps we can write a program that will get most of it right, but need a
              manual check to catch errors, in cases where manual fixing is cheaper than making the
              automatic process do the right thing).</li>
            <li>We are converting a few thousand MARC records into TEI headers. The conversion
              program tries to strip off the trailing punctuation added in the MARC record
              (additional full stops, semi-colons, colons, etc., depending on the internal structure
              of the MARC fields), but in a few cases out of every thousand fields, the algorithm is
              not quite right. The program writes out the TEI header with its best guess at the
              correct content of the element, but it also writes out the original trailing
              punctuation, in a specially marked processing instruction. We wish for some reasonably
              alert human being to go through the material and say, for each field, whether to
              accept the program's proposal or to restore the original punctuation. In a very small
              number of cases, neither the program's best guess nor the original punctuation is
              correct, and the reviewer must specify some third form of the data.</li>
          </p>
        <p class="noindent">In each of these cases, a full-scale general-purpose XML editor can be used but has a
          number of drawbacks. The user performing the task must be trained in the full editor, and
          once the document is open in a general-purpose editor there are no limits to what changes
          can be made, or in cases of inattention or confusion, no limits to the damage that can be
          infliced on the document. It would be preferable to perform such specialized XML
          modification tasks in what are sometimes called "padded cell" editors, which provide
          simple limited interfaces for performing specific tasks. In a padded cell editor for
          sentence-boundary correction, for example, the user should be able to open a document,
          delete sentence boundaries (joining adjacent s elements), insert them (splitting s
          elements), save the document, and quit. An editor which provides ONLY those operations
          will be a lot easier to learn than a general purpose editor, and allows a careless or
          hapless user to do much less harm. Special-purpose editors can also incorporate knowledge
          of the underlying markup language and its usage in a particular project more effectively
          than is possible for general-purpose editors.</p>
        <p class="noindent">It has rarely been feasible, however, to use conventional programming tools to build
          special-purpose editors for individual XML vocabularies, let alone such specialized tasks:
          using standard libraries, such editors would run to thousands or tens of thousands of
          lines of Java or Objective C.</p>
        <p class="noindent">XForms (and some related technologies) change the equation.</p>
        <p class="noindent">XForms is built around the model / view / controller idiom, in which the model is a set
          of XML documents, the view is specified using XHTML and the XForms widget set, and the
          controller takes the form of declarative rules linking widgets to elements and attributes
          in the markup. That is to say: XForms can be regarded as a technology for building
          padded-cell editors; it has great potential for extensive application in any project
          making systematic use of XML.</p>
        <p class="noindent">The tutorial will comprise four blocks of material, of about 45 minutes each.</p>
