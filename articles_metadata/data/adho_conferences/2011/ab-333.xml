                <p class="noindent">Why do novelistic genres end? Why do we see gothic and industrial novels, <i>Bildungsromane</i> and mysteries, all disappear after periods
                    of popularity during the 18th and 19th centuries? How literary forms—novelistic
                    genres in particular—come and cease to be has long been an area of inquiry, and
                    the work of Franco Moretti (2005) in <i>Graphs, Maps, Trees</i>
                    has given the topic new energy.</p>

                <p class="noindent">The years since the publication of “Graphs” in 2003 have seen the resources
                    available for investigating patterns in 19th century literary production expand
                    immeasurably. For example, scans of over 7,800 volumes of 19th century British
                    novels are now available from the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign’s
                    collection alone. Those interested in extending or challenging Moretti’s
                    observation that novelistic genres tend to arrive in “bursts” linked to social
                    generations—or, in general, in contributing to Moretti’s proposed “sociology of
                    literary form”—now have access to a wealth of new data. Given the continuing
                    interest that Moretti’s work has generated among students of the human, social,
                    and natural sciences, this represents an important opportunity.</p>

                <p class="noindent">My contribution explores further the prospects for a “demography of literary
                    forms,” building on Moretti’s proposal for research at the intersection of
                    literary history and sociology.I owe the suggestion for a demographic
                        approach to Shalizi (2006)’s review of <i>Graphs, Maps,
                            Tress</i>: “There is a demography of businesses, of interest groups,
                        even of medieval manuscripts of classical works, and so why not one of
                        literary texts?” First, I consider opportunities to improve Moretti’s
                    original “generational model” of cycles in literary forms, offering new methods
                    to remedy identified evidential gaps. For example, Moretti’s periodizations of
                    genres—e.g. Courtship Novel, 1740-1820—have been criticized as too neatly
                    falling on certain “focal dates” such as years falling at the end of a decade
                    (Shalizi, 2006). I present new evidence in support of this criticism and
                    demonstrate a method for making periodizations reproducible by others. Being
                    able to reproduce Moretti’s results will hopefully make the research program
                    itself more open to experimentation and invite collaboration. My method uses
                    bibliographic databases to establish the period during which the vast majority
                    (~90%) of the novels in a given genre were published. This provides a
                    reproducible periodization suited to an inquiry into social history.The
                        bibliographic databases used are Garside’s <i>British Fiction
                            Database, 1800-1829</i> with 2,272 titles and Bassett’s <i>At the Circulating Library, 1837-1901</i> with 7335
                        titles I also briefly discuss the application of classification
                    algorithms from machine learning to identify possibly overlooked genres in
                    Moretti’s dataset. The new method for periodization is demonstrated in detail
                    for two of the forty-four genres in Moretti’s dataset, the silver fork and
                    Newgate novels.The methods presented are designed to accommodate changes
                        to the underlying dataset and can be used by others who may disagree with
                        classifications of particular novels and even with the bibliographic records
                        provided by Garside and Bassett.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Second, in order to offer an alternative to the generational model, I argue for
                    and attempt to test the hypothesis that the observed clustering of genre
                    appearances and disappearances can also be explained by positing a “carrying
                    capacity,” an upper limit on the number of established novelistic genres able to
                    be supported by writers, readers, and publishers in any given year.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Finally, I explore the suggestion that generational changes in “mental climate”
                    might manifest themselves not (only) in changes in novelistic genres, as
                    suggested by Moretti, but rather in topical changes within novelistic genres. In
                    studying a topic model (Steyvers et al., 2007) of the 7,800 volumes in UIUC’s
                    19th century novels collection, I observe some evidence for topical trends
                    cutting across multiple genres. For example, starting in the mid-19th century
                    there is a proportional rise in a cluster of words suggestive of farming and
                    rural life.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Moretti’s work has been a touchstone for numerous discussions connected to the
                    digital humanities—for example, the fate of “close reading”. Perhaps more
                    significant in the long-run is the interest his work has gained from scholars in
                    the social and natural sciences, with examples ranging from formal reviews like
                    that of statistician Cosma Shalizi (2006) to more informal commentary on
                    quantitative literary history from social scientists like Henry Farrell (2010)
                    and Andrew Gelman (2010). Finding scholars outside of literary studies and
                    literary history publicly engaging with research is an important development.
                    Given the desirability of new models of research in the humanities, Moretti’s
                    program can claim a interdisciplinary following that makes revisiting and
                    extending his work of particular significance.</p>
