                <p class="noindent">This paper discusses the re-development of The Image Markup Tool in two parts:
                    (1) as a crossplatform desktop application and (2) as a web-based, html5
                    standard, client-side browser application. Currently, a few <i>text-based</i> tools allow for markup of documents (most often) in
                    XML/TEI. They range from legacy software such as the Analytical System Tools and
                    SGML/XML Integration Applications (Anastasia)(ITSEE, University of
                        Birmingham; http://www.sd-editions.com/anastasia/index.html) and
                    Editing Digital Interactive Texts in an Online Network
                        (EDITION),http://www.sd-editions.com/EDITION/ to more recent
                    projects such as eLaborate,Huygens Instituut KNAW (a research institute
                        for text edition and textual scholarship of the Royal Netherlands Academy of
                        Arts and Sciences); http://www.e-laborate.nl/en/
                        TextGrid,http://www.textgrid.de/ and
                        TEXTvre.http://textvre.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/ TextGrid uses a
                    collaborative document markup interface, as well as a project and user
                    management system to facilitate the markup of texts. TEXTvre, which will be
                    modeled on TextGrid, has been described as a “a working exemplar VRE for textual
                    scholarship.” While each of these tools offers specific methods of text-based
                    editing, The Image Markup Tool is <i>image-based</i>, allowing
                    for the markup of encoded digital images of remediated textual objects.</p>
                <p class="noindent">We are building on the current iteration of The Image Markup Tool (v1), developed
                    by Martin Holmes at the University of Victoria. Version 1 of the Image Markup
                    Tool was first written in 2006, and has gone through several versions. It was
                    originally conceived as part of the project <i>Le mariage sous
                        L'Ancien Régime</i>,http://mariage.uvic.ca/ where it was used
                    to mark up engravings (Carlin, Haswell and Holmes 2006; Carlin and Holmes 2008).
                    Early versions of the tool used SVG code embedded into a TEI file to delineate
                    areas of interest on an image, but the current version makes use of the
                    Facsimile module recently added to the TEI schema, which enables the use of
                    native TEI elements to define rectangular “zones” on “surfaces” (often pages)
                    which are part of a facsimile.</p>
                <p class="noindent">However, version 1 of the Image Markup Tool suffers from a number of serious
                    limitations, most of which were apparent from its inception. Firstly, it allows
                    only rectangular areas (hereafter “zones”) to be specified on images. This was
                    in line with the original specification of the Facsimile module in TEI, in which
                    &lt;zone&gt; elements were similarly constrained, but users have been demanding
                    the ability to specify polygonal shapes ever since the first release, and recent
                    modifications to the TEI schema now allow the use of polygonal &lt;zone&gt;
                    elements. Secondly, IMT version 1 can handle only one image per file. This was
                    sufficient for its original projected use as part of the <i>Mariage</i> project, which focused on individual engravings, but makes the
                    tool inadequate for serious facsimile work; most documents have multiple
                    surfaces or pages. Thirdly, the program can handle only a one-to-one
                    relationship between a single &lt;zone&gt; on a &lt;surface&gt;, and a single
                    &lt;div&gt; in the &lt;body&gt; of the document. This is inadequate. It is a
                    common requirement to link, for instance, a single block of text on an image to
                    an original transcription, a modernized version of the transcription, and an
                    editorial note or interpretation. Similarly, a single &lt;div&gt; (or in fact
                    any other element) in the body of a text might conceivably be linked to more
                    than one &lt;zone&gt;; multiple views of a particular surface or page might be
                    provided in the facsimile, each with an equivalent &lt;zone&gt;. Finally, IMT
                    version 1 was written as a Windows application using Borland Delphi. It will run
                    on Linux using Wine, but there is no simple way to run it on a Macintosh
                    computer.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Nevertheless, IMT version 1 has a number of strengths. As a compiled desktop
                    application, using a very sophisticated open-source graphics library
                    (Graphics32), it can to do high-quality resampling of images on-the-fly,
                    enabling effective and rapid zooming of high-resolution images. Most file
                    operations are very fast, and the interface itself is simple and relatively easy
                    to use. For Windows and Linux users, it is easy to download and install.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The desktop version of IMT 2 is being written using Nokia's QT Creator tools.
                    This will enable us to compile the application for Windows, Mac and Linux. Our
                    intention is to build on the strengths of version 1 -- in particular, the speed
                    and efficiency of graphics handling and file i/o, and the user-friendliness and
                    simplicity of the interface -- while adding three important improvements:</p>
                <p class="noindent">
                    
                        <li>Handling of an unlimited number of images.</li>
                        <li>Many-to-many linking between &lt;zone&gt;s and any elements with
                            @xml:id attributes in the &lt;text&gt; section of the file.</li>
                        <li>Support for polygonal zones.</li>
                    
                </p>
                <p class="noindent">These screenshots of early development pilots show how we envisage the user
                    interface.</p>
                <p class="noindent">

                <p class="noindent">The first shows the main window, with multiple folios (pages) listed down the
                    left side. Clicking on a folio shows the corresponding image, and the polygonal
                    zones defined on that image (in red). The selected zone has draggable circular
                    nodes at all of its corners. The context menu for the selected zone is
                    displayed, showing that the zone is linked to three different elements in the
                    &lt;text&gt;.</p>
                <p class="noindent">
                    <p>
                        <img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//128/128-2.jpg" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-128.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//128/128-2.jpg','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p class="noindent">The second screenshot shows the corresponding dialog box, where the user can
                    select an element in the &lt;text&gt; of the TEI file for linking to a zone.
                    Three views of the file are available: the first is a read-only
                    syntax-highlighted text view, the second consists of a list of all the @xml:id
                    attributes in the file, along with a text box which can be used to filter them,
                    and the third is an “outline” or tree view of the file. The user could use any
                    of these to find and select an element to be linked to a zone. In addition, the
                    user will be able to edit any element in the &lt;text&gt; of the TEI file
                    directly, to add transcription, markup, @xml:id attributes, etc. We do not
                    envisage that the majority of XML editing will be done in the Image Markup Tool
                    itself; rather, the base transcription would be done using an XML editor such as
                    oXygen, and the file brought into the IMT for the definition and linking of
                    images and zones. However, it will be important to allow direct editing of the
                    XML code so that corrections and changes can be made without moving the file
                    back into an XML editor.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The web platform of the Image Markup Tool fills a gap in current collaborative
                    editing models, and will provide a lightweight “edit-anywhere” version of the
                    desktop application. The web-platform will be built for a large population of
                    needs, but our first user-case study will be the Editing Modernism in Canada
                    Project (EMiC).http://editingmodernism.ca Rather than following
                    past practices of transcribing texts and marking up transcriptions in the
                    creation of electronic texts, EMiC and its partners will pioneer image-based
                    editing, semantic markup, analysis, and visualization of texts in a field of
                    emergent practices in digital-humanities scholarship. Instead of producing
                    reading environments based on linear-discursive transcriptions of texts, EMiC
                    will produce in collaboration with its partners techniques and technologies for
                    encoding and interpreting the complex relations among large collections of
                    visual and audial objects in non-linear reading environments.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Our rationale for a web-based browser application includes facilitating RESTful
                    architecture and interoperability with other systems via API (including, for
                    example, Scripto,http://www.scripto.org developed at the Centre for
                    History for New Media at George Mason University). The IMT web-platform will
                    allow a user to load images and XML documents into a browser window (either
                    locally or via URL). The drawing and linking of the polygonal &lt;zone&gt;s now
                    supported in the TEI schema are made possible with the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt;
                    element. As in the desktop application, it is assumed that the user will perform
                    most TEI markup with an XML editor (such as oXygen), but the application will
                    also support lightweight XML editing. The most powerful feature of the web-based
                    application will be the potential to feed linked XML documents and images
                    directly into a collection-builder such as
                        Omekahttp://www.omeka.org to facilitate scholarly edition
                    building and electronic publishing via a suite of tools.</p>
