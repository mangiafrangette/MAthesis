                <p class="noindent">Despite the ground-breaking work of graphics visionaries like Alan
                        SutherlandAlan Sutherland built the first graphics program named
                        “Sketchpad” as part of his PhD. work in 1963. Sketchpad allowed users to
                        draw geometric shapes and create copies of them. This work was not only
                        important in the realm of computer aided design (it is viewed as the
                        grandfather of modern CAD software), but also in its organization of the
                        code in objects, which is the basis for modern object oriented
                        design. and Ed CatmullBeyond his current role as CTO of Pixar,
                        Catmull is perhaps one of the most important people in the world of computer
                        graphics, discovering methods to apply images to geometries, smoothing lines
                        drawn on computer screens, among many others. He was also a student of
                        Sutherland... in the 1960s and 1970s, which unlocked computer screens
                    as interactive tools, hardware portability issues have constrained computer
                    interaction to a two-dimensional space which often simulates the real world.
                    However, the considerable market growth of sophisticated mobile devices over the
                    last several years has begun to push the boundaries of interaction in virtual
                    environments. Instead of experiencing a simulated environment sitting at a
                    computer, users are shifting to experiencing physical environments with a
                    computing device capable of enriching their subjectie experience of the space.
                    The success of augmented reality systems like BionicEye, RobotVision,
                    TATAugmented ID, and Layar provides glimpses at how this technology might be
                    leveraged by cultural heritage institutions, individual academics, and even
                    local, municpal officials, to provide opportunities for students and the general
                    public to interact with space and place in new and exciting ways.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The University of Virginia’s Department of Architectural History holds its
                    training-oriented field school, under the direction of Professor Louis Nelson,
                    in the city of Falmouth Jamaica each year. Falmouth is a fruitful city for study
                    because of its unique history, which makes it the best preserved example of
                    Georgian architecture in the Caribbean. Founded in 1769, the city was originally
                    designed as the main northern port for the island’s thriving sugar trade. Tied
                    closely to the infamous “Triangle-trade”, the slave-based sugar economy allowed
                    the city to grow until the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire in 1840.
                    After 1840, the town saw a significant decline and experienced very little
                    construction over the next 170 years, preserving its architecture and urban
                    design as an early nineteenth-century time capsule.</p>
                <p class="noindent">In 2009, the Jamaican government approved development of a cruise ship terminal
                    in Falmouth. Its first ships are scheduled for docking in the summer of 2011.
                    The predicted influx of tourism to the town will be an economic boon to
                    residents, but will also bring significant changes to the architectural identity
                    of the town. The 11-acre port is of such size that, while ships are docked, they
                    will tower over the Trewlany Parish Church of St. Peter, the tallest building in
                    the town. New dining and recreation facilities will be constructed around the
                    terminal, and a simplified interpretation of early nineteenth-century life will
                    be constructed for the enjoyment of tourists. This will result a better standard
                    of living for most residents of the town, but will mean the loss of an
                    historical laboratory for architecture. As businesses sprout up, residents will
                    be pushed away from areas around the terminal and century-old houses will be
                    torn down and replaced with store-fronts.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Realizing that the introduction of the cruise terminal to the city will forever
                    alter the architectural identity of the town, the UVa Architectural History
                    Field School recently shifted its focus from deep analysis of a handful of
                    buildings in a single summer, to a more general effort to survey the status of
                    the buildings of the entire city. This survey includes measured sketches,
                    colorcoding of a given structure’s overall condition, images of the structure as
                    it stands today, and information on when the building was constructed,
                    construction material, and other items of interest to architectural historians.
                    These findings were then submitted to UVa Library’s Special Collections for
                    long-term archiving.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Sensing a real opportunity to provide access to this important work, the
                    Scholars’ Lab partnered with Louis Nelson, chair of the Architectural History
                    department, to investigate ways to make this nearly decade’s worth of research
                    available to a wider audience. We identified three groups of users for the
                    content: academics interested in the underlying data of the city, government
                    officials who need to plan city restoration efforts, and tourists interested in
                    finding out more about the town they will visit. The Scholars’ Lab was
                    particularly interested in interface design decisions that would serve each of
                    these communities well.</p>
                <p class="noindent">In order to provide different mechanisms of access for three distinct user
                    groups, we employed several open-source tools to create a solution that would
                    expose this valuble architectural and historical data to a large and varied
                    audience. Leveraging our own expertise in open-source Geographic Information
                    Systems infrastructureIn 2009 and 2010, the Scholars’ Lab hosted an
                        NEH-funded “Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship:” 
         (<a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/geospatial/" target="blank">link</a>)
   . At DH 2009,
                        several members of the Scholars’ Lab presented a panel discussion (“New
                        World Orderings”) on GIS, including a description of our open source , web
                        services-based Geospatial Data Portal: 
         (<a href="http://gis.lib.virginia.edu" target="blank">link</a>)
   . And at DH 2010, Scholars’ Lab
                        director Bethany Nowviskie presented a poster on possibilities for spatial
                        humanities, “Inventing the Map.” with the flexibility of the Omeka
                    collections and exhibits framework, the Scholars’ Lab has constructed several
                    different ways in which these different audiences may interact with
                    library-curated spatial data.</p>
                <p class="noindent">In order to allow city planners access to the underlying data, maps originally
                    drawn in AutoCad were converted to a GIS format and loaded on to a
                    web-accessible server. Web services were created to allow high-end users of GIS
                    software access to the information with proprietary tools like ArcGIS. We then
                    utilized those same web services to create map interactions within Omeka using
                    the open source mapping library OpenLayers. Images and metadata (along with the
                    full architectural survey report) were uploaded to Omeka and a custom VRA Core
                    metadata standard was created to allow more appropriate description of the
                    architectural elements in the collection. Long-form academic essays are also in
                    the process of being written for approximately 30 of the most important
                    structures in the city. These will be presented along with maps highlighting
                    where important structures are located, to allow visual methods for browsing the
                    collections to function in tandem with scholarly interventions to highlight
                    specific structures of interest. Importantly, this approach also allows us to
                    expose underlying geographic information as web services, allowing other
                    scholars to reuse the information.</p>
                <p class="noindent">While the site boasts other advanced features, including a faceted Solr-based
                    search, we also wanted to explore methods for exposing the same data in new ways
                    to the different target groups for the project. With the growth of web-enabled
                    smart devices, we plan to try two experiments at the Vernacular Architecture
                    Forum’s Annual Meeting, in June 2011 in Falmouth, Jamaica. The first will place
                    QR codes at selected structures around the town to allow individuals with
                    web-enabled phones to access all of the information about the structure
                    presented on the Scholars’ Lab website. We are also building a Layar-based
                    augmented reality browser for the city which will allow individuals with smart
                    phones (iPhones and Android-based devices) to install a simple application that
                    will overlay information about buildings on a viewport, accessed simply by
                    pointing their phones at the building.</p>
                <p class="noindent">This is an ongoing project, with field experiments and user feedback scheduled to
                    be conducted before the Digital Humanities 2011 conference. We hope to model a
                    technical approach to providing access to library-curated information for
                    multiple audiences, using different technological approaches and techniques to
                    frame the data not only in terms of scholarly use, but for tourism and cultural
                    heritage appreciation, and for the more practical employment of the data by city
                    planners to optimize restoration efforts. We also hope that these tools will
                    help raise awareness about the fragility of the town to tourists, and can act as
                    a way to expose UVa students’ and scholars’ research in multiple formats to
                    those interested in underlying historical and spatial data, and the multimedia
                    and embodied arguments which have been crafted using new tools and methods.</p>
