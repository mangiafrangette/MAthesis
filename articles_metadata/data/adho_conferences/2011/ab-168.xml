        </h4><hr />
      
        <p class="noindent">Stylometric studies, in all their variety of material and method, 
           share two common features: the electronic texts they study have to 
           be coaxed somehow to yield numbers, and the numbers themselves have 
           to be processed with statistical software. Sometimes, the two 
           actions are two independent parts of a given study. To give the 
           simplest example, one piece of software is used solely to compile 
           word frequency lists; then, one of the many commercial statistics 
           packages takes over to extract meaning from this mass of words, draw 
           graphs etc.</p>
        <p class="noindent">This approach works if standard statistical procedures are applied 
           to the data. For multivariate word-frequency-based authorship 
           attribution, for instance, once free AntConc produces word lists 
           with frequencies, expensive (yet often university-licensed) SAS, 
           SPSS or Statistica can be used to produce relative frequencies and 
           correlation matrices thereof, and one of their many modules can in 
           turn produce Principal Components (PCA), Cluster (CA), or 
           Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analyses. This is already a very 
           comfortable situation when compared to what Burrows had to rely 
           on in his seminal work on Jane Austen’s style (Burrows 1987).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Yet, as stylometrists have begun to produce statistical methods 
           of their own – to name but a few, Burrows’s Delta, Zeta and Iota 
           (Burrows 2002, 2006) and their modifications by other scholars 
           (Argamon 2008, Craig and Kinney 2009, Hoover 2004a, 2004b) – 
           commercial software, despite its wide array of accessible methods, 
           becomes something of a straitjacket. This is why a number of 
           dedicated stylometric solutions have appeared, targeting the 
           specific analyses frequently used in this community.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Hoover’s Delta, Zeta and Iota Excel spreadsheets are a pioneering 
           and excellent example of this approach (Hoover 2004b). Constantly 
           developed since at least 2004 (when one of the authors of this 
           presentation received a CD-ROM with an early version), they have at 
           least two major assets: they do exactly what the stylometrist wants 
           (with several optional procedures) and they only require spreadsheet 
           software that has become (for better or worse) the standard on most 
           computers in the world today. This has been especially helpful for 
           uses in specialist workshops and classrooms; the student only needs 
           additional (and, often, free) software to produce word frequency 
           lists and he/she is ready to go. Yet Excel imposes one limitation: 
           it is overkill in terms of memory usage, which results in the 
           slowness of its processing. Also, the two-stage nature of the 
           process (a separate piece of software prepares word lists that can 
           be later automatically imported into the spreadsheet) might be 
           something of a problem simply because it would take an experienced 
           Visual Basic programmer to make Excel compile the word lists 
           themselves.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In this respect, Juola’s JGAAP can directly import texts in 
           a variety of formats and perform a whole variety of authorship 
           attribution tasks with an imposing variety of methods, statistical 
           approaches and material on which they are based (Juola 
           <i>et al.</i> 2006, 2008). These can be further 
           expanded by experienced programmers in Java.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Java is also the language of another software solution which takes 
           possibly an even broader approach. Craig’s Intelligent Archive (in 
           its many flavours), apart from performing certain stylometric tasks, 
           is also a corpus organizer; once the initial work of registering 
           texts is done, it allows a versatile combination of individual texts 
           and groups of texts (Craig and Kinney, 2010).</p>
        <p class="noindent">A new trend in producing stylometric tools is associated with R, 
           a GNU project, a language and environment for statistical computing 
           and graphics (www.r-project.org) in the image of its commercial 
           counterpart, S. While it came into its version 1.0 in 2000, it has 
           been used for analyses on language only recently. Its strongest 
           promoters in this community include authors of 
           corpus-linguistics-oriented books on the usage of R, Baayen (2008) 
           and Gries (2009). R has already been used in authorship attribution 
           research by Jockers <i>et al.</i> (2008, 2010).</p>
        <p class="noindent">The scripts presented in this poster have begun with the first 
           author’s participation in an R workshop taught by Gries at 
           University of Leipzig’s 1<sup>st</sup> European Summer 
           School “Culture and Technology.” Very soon, a series of R scripts 
           appeared, targeted at a variety of experiments with Delta and other 
           distance measures. Very soon, too, it became evident that R is 
           capable of processing texts and statistics in a fraction of the 
           time needed by other tools. Also, R scripts can be relied on for 
           doing the whole work themselves, from manipulating texts (typically, 
           to produce word lists) all the way to graphing the results (and that 
           in a great variety).</p>
        <p class="noindent">These capabilities were put tu use in the study of Delta’s 
           dependence on studied texts’ sizes (Eder 2010), and on the behaviour 
           of Delta at a variety of intervals in the word frequency rank lists 
           in a variety of languages (Rybicki and Eder 2011). The R environment 
           permitted us to cover huge statistics at unprecedented rates (often 
           thousands of Delta iterations per hour in corpora of a hundred 
           full-size novels). It also permitted us to use other statistical 
           methods, such as PCA, CA or MDS, or those rarely used so far in 
           this field – such as bootstrap consensus trees based on a study of 
           Papuan languages by Dunn <i>et al.</i> (2005, quoted 
           in Baayen 2008: 143-47). What is more, the entire analysis – from 
           loading texts to final results in numeric and graphic form – can be 
           accomplished with a single script. Our Delta script, for instance, 
           did all the work: it processed electronic texts to create a list of 
           all the words used in all texts studied, with their frequencies in 
           the individual texts; normalized the frequencies with z-scores (if 
           applicable); selected words from stated frequency ranges for 
           analysis; performed additional procedures that (usually) improve 
           attribution, such as Hoover’s automatic deletion of personal 
           pronouns and culling (automatic removal of words too characteristic 
           for individual texts); compared the results for individual texts; 
           performed a variety of multivariate analyses; presented the 
           similarities/distances obtained in tree diagrams; finally, produced 
           the above-mentioned consensus tree – a new graph that combined many 
           tree diagrams for a variety of parameter values (Fig. 1). It was our 
           aim to develop a general platform for multi-iteration attribution 
           tests; for instance, an alternate script produced heatmaps to show 
           the degree of Delta’s success in attribution at various intervals of 
           the word frequency ranking list (Fig. 2).</p>

        <p class="noindent">What is more, despite the fact that the R environment might daunt 
           (digital) humanists with its initially steep learning curve, it soon 
           became evident that ready-made tools can be developed to make the 
           full power of R accessible even to inexperienced users with its 
           capability of working with Tcl/Tk graphic user interfaces (Fig. 3) 
           prepared by the second author for two seminar groups of his MA 
           students, who were asked to make the switch to R from the more 
           traditional software, with success: one of these groups has already 
           successfully defended their completed theses on authorship 
           attribution and stylistic variety in a good number of corpora.</p>
