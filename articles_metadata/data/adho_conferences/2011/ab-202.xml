                    University of South Carolina, 
                    <a href="mailto:allisonmarsh@yahoo.com">allisonmarsh@yahoo.com</a>

                <p class="noindent">For presenters and attendees at DH2011, there is no need to sing the praises of
                    the digital world. We are the early adopters, the converted, the evangelists.
                    But our colleagues across the humanities are not yet entirely convinced, and of
                    more concern to me, neither are the students. I direct the museum studies track
                    of the masters in public history at the University of South Carolina, one of the
                    oldest public history programs in the country. It is a nationally competitive
                    program, and our graduates have an impressive placement record: the Smithsonian;
                    the National Park Service; federal, state, and local government. And yet, since
                    I joined the faculty three years ago, I have been shocked that the students –
                    the so-called digital natives – have little interest in the digital world as
                    part of their professional training. They may communicate with each other using
                    Facebook, share photos on Flickr, or post to their personal blogs, but when it
                    comes to coursework they expect, and sometimes demand, a traditional graduate
                    seminar where we read and discuss books. More than one student has balked at my
                    assignments, whining, “I don’t need to learn how to program. I just want to be a
                        <i>regular</i> historian.” Unyielding in my persistence, I
                    argue back that it is no longer an option. Wikis, blogs, and tweeting are
                    everyday realities for museum professionals. At the very minimum, all curators
                    and collections managers need to have a basic understanding of database
                    architecture in order to structure their object databases and construct useful
                    queries. More importantly, two decades of digitization has created new questions
                    for curators of three-dimensional objects: What does material culture look like
                    on the web? How do you curate it? How does the public interact with virtual
                    objects? What is the relationship between virtual and physical museum
                    artifacts?</p>
                <p class="noindent">Each fall I teach HIST 787: Material Culture Studies, the foundational graduate
                    seminar for the museums track in our masters program. On the first day of class,
                    I ask the students to bring in five objects that describe either themselves or
                    their research interests. I tell them to choose wisely, as they will be using
                    those objects every week for the entire semester, but otherwise I give no
                    guidance to object selection. The objects serve multiple purposes throughout the
                    semester, but most importantly they are part of a larger project to create an
                    object database that represents the changing attitudes towards material culture
                    in the digital age. Each year the students must create an online exhibit drawing
                    from the objects in the database, the objects of both their classmates as well
                    as the students of previous years. Clearly each year the number of objects in
                    the database increases, and the distance from the early contributors becomes
                    greater. I am in Year 3 of what I anticipate to be a decade long study, and this
                    short paper presentation is designed to give preliminary results. Because this
                    course is part of a two-year masters degree, this is the first year where the
                    students do not have direct access to the owners of objects from previous
                    classes.</p>
                <p class="noindent">I have chosen Omeka as the platform for this assignment. Although I am well aware
                    of the limitations, as well as the potential, of the open source software, Omeka
                    has a low barrier for entry. Omeka was developed by George Mason University’s
                    Center for History and New Media with non-IT specialists in mind. CHNM’s goal
                    was (and continues to be) to provide museum and library professionals with a
                    tool that allows them to concentrate on content and interpretation without
                    worrying about programming. I am concerned that by using a black box application
                    my students don’t fully understand the implications of engaging with the virtual
                    world. However, that is one of the compromises I have made in order to encourage
                    budding historians to get their toes wet in the digital arena.</p>
                <p class="noindent">For their final assignment, students must create records for each of their
                    objects, which includes uploading images, entering Dublin Core metadata, tagging
                    objects with key words, and writing short descriptions. The students then must
                    curate their own exhibit, either by using one of the theme templates provided by
                    CHNM or by creating their own. The open source software allows students who are
                    more skilled or interested in web design to create more elaborate exhibits.</p>
                <p class="noindent">So far the results of the online exhibits have been mostly disastrous. As a
                    whole, the exhibits are terrible (available at 
         (<a href="http://hist787.cas.sc.edu" target="blank">link</a>)
   ). They have clunky navigation, lack any
                    elegance in design, and often are just plain boring. In many ways, the exhibits
                    are proof of my distrust of black box software for developing online exhibits
                    and are an indicator that anyone who wants to engage seriously in the virtual
                    world needs significantly more training (either formally or informally) than a
                    few hours of online tutorials can provide. More generously, these online
                    exhibits are often the first experience students have in curating, and so one of
                    the assignment’s goals is for students to gain skills in developing effective
                    narrative techniques (useful in both physical and digital curation). In
                    assessing their work, it is important to be mindful of the learning process;
                    remember that they are professionals in training, and they should not be judged
                    on their first attempt but rather on the progress they achieve by the time they
                    graduate.</p>
                <p class="noindent">However, as a pedagogical device, the assignment has been tremendously
                    successful. By working through the process of creating an online exhibit, the
                    students naturally confront the many epistemic questions relating to the use of
                    physical objects in a virtual environment. Students immediately recognize the
                    diverse challenges of working in the digital format, from the pedestrian, such
                    as how to search for items when a previous user failed to enter appropriate
                    metadata, to the substantial, such as questioning the ethics of using an object
                    as a metonym in an exhibit that is antithetical to the physical object’s
                    authenticity. My goal for the assignment is not for students to become master
                    web designers, but for them to engage in the questions confronting digital
                    curation.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Although I could talk at length about the implications of this ongoing
                    assignment, this short paper will focus on the joint challenges of curating
                    digital resources and the role of digital humanities in the academic curricula –
                    how are universities training the next generation of museum professionals who
                    will have to confront digital curation. My presentation will be a snap shot of a
                    longitudinal study that is currently in progress. I will briefly describe the
                    assignment, its goals, and the unexpected lessons learned thus far. I hope to
                    reach fellow members of the academy to discuss effective teaching techniques
                    while at the same time seeking feedback from museum professionals as to what
                    skills they believe graduating students should have. How do professors balance
                    the need to provide theoretical training in how to read and interpret material
                    culture while fostering the development of technical skills in an ever-changing
                    digital landscape?</p>
