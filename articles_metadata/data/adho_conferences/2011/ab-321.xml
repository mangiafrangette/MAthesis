				<h2></h2>
				<p class="noindent">In digital humanities the word "text" (in both mass and count noun
						senses)By the end of the paper I hope the relation between the mass
						and the count senses of the noun "text" will be clear. That "text" has a
						count noun sense is embodied in the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines
						(2008 passim). occurs ubiquitously; familiar uses include text
					encoding, full text search, there are six texts online, we are using the text of
					the first edition. Typically the word is not defined in the specific context of
					its use, nor is there an overarching definition or description so widely
					accepted that it is taken as given at all times. However, our various uses of
					"text" show we have a priori assumptions about the nature and scope of its
					reference. But what are those assumptions? are they justified? do they
					collectively define "(a) text" for us?Text encoding models have of course
						benefited greatly from the "ordered hierarchy of content objects" definition
						proposed in DeRose et al 1990 and its subsequent refinements such as in
						Renear et al 1996. Caton 1999 discusses the relation between the TEI element
						&lt;text&gt; and the concept of "a text". Caton and the INKE Research Group
						2010 argues for greater precision in the use of core digital humanities
						terms such as "text".</p>

				<p class="noindent">In this preliminary investigation I approach from the outside in. I take a number
					of marginal cases and of each one ask "is this a <i>text</i>?" -
					because any attempt to answer that question must draw out the assumptions that
					underlie our common usages. I focus on the count noun sense because discrete
					entities with boundaries ought to be easier to recognize. In our professional
					lives we talk about "texts" all the time: oughtn't we to know one when we see
					one?</p>

				<p class="noindent">The marginal cases I discuss are an encrypted message (<a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-321.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">Figure 1</a>), a sigilSigils in general are magical

				<h2>Summary of Discussion</h2>
				<p class="noindent">I suggest the following are core assumptions underlying our collective use of "a
					text":</p>

				
					<li><p class="noindent"><b>representation of language</b>: for any
							non-metaphorical use we think that language must be involved. Unlike a
							painting or a piece of music, which seem to affect us unmediated by
							language, for something to be "a text" it must resolve to language in
							our heads, even if what we see does not <i>directly</i>
							represent language. Thus we see Milton Glaser's famous logo "I [heart
							symbol] NY" and in our heads hear the words "I love New York", because
							the particular symbol-word association is so common that it resolves
							almost by default - especially given the linguistic context in which the
							heart symbol occurs. The encrypted message in Figure 1 is all linguistic
							symbols, but not <i>directly</i> interpretable as any
							language. Resolution to language depends upon knowing how to decipher
							the symbol sequence - though I suggest that as creatures of language
							even if we do not know the cipher (and so the sequence remains
							impenetrable to us) we think it likely that the sequence we see is a
							reversible transformation of a comprehensible linguistic sequence. We
							accord it an honorary status as "a text" whose lack of recognition is
							due to our ignorance, and not to its being something other than "a
							text". But Figure 2 is a different matter. Unlike the product of the
							cipher transformation - an incomprehensible string of what are
							recognisably linguistic symbols - sigilization transforms a
							comprehensible sequence of linguistic symbols into an almost purely
							graphic image. I suggest that seeing the final sigil without knowing its
							origin, we would not even accord it honorary status as "a text", because
							the deletions, substitutions, and spatial reconfigurations make it
							almost impossible to resolve back into language - there are so few clues
							that it started out as language in the first place. On the other hand,
							the linguistic message has not been replaced by a figurative image, in
							the way that a photograph of an emaciated child might replace the symbol
							sequence "children are starving" - indeed mimetic representation of the
							desire conveyed by the communication would not be to the purpose, "[t]he
							idea being," writes Spare, "to obtain a simple form which can be easily
							visualised at will, and has not too much pictorial relation to the
							desire." (50) For the person who creates the sigil the message is still
							completely present, implying that for them at least the sigil <i>is</i> "a text".</p></li>

					<li><p class="noindent"><b>communication</b>: in the normative case for "a text"
							we assume that a linguistic symbol sequence has been created to
							communicate, which is the primary function of such sequences. We assume
							the sequence forms a message (or, in the case of a fragment, would form
							a message if the entire sequence were present). We have such a
							propensity to find a message, to make sense out of a sequence, that we
							will try to establish "a text" even in the least promising cases.
							Because the glyph shown in Figure 3 represents a character that (in
							addition to being a letter) is also a lexical item in English it
							triggers that response, but because the lexical item is supposed to
							function as a determiner yet here determines nothing it gives us no
							semantic purchase. Compare this to <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-321.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=#X" target="_top">Figure 3b</a>:</p>
						<p class="noindent">
							<p>
								<h2>Figure 3b</h2>
								<img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//321/fig3b.png" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-321.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//321/fig3b.png','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
							</p>
						</p>
						<p class="noindent">This is another glyph that represents a character that is both letter <i>and</i> lexical item, and here in majuscule form as
							proper to the lexical item. Because pronouns carry more semantics than
							indefinite articles it gives us more 'traction'; I suggest that we would
							rank Figure 3b as <i>closer</i> to being "a text" than
							Figure 3, even if we wouldn't commit to saying that it <i>is</i> "a text".</p></li>


					<li><p class="noindent"><b>completeness</b>: the completeness of the message
							embedded in the symbol sequence depends entirely upon the context. What
							is merely part of "a text" in one context can stand alone in another
							context, as the excerpt from Churchill's speech does in Figure 4. If we
							say that the poster in Figure 4 contains "a text", though, does that
							text contain the words "The Prime Minister" - or are we looking at two
							texts, one (just the quote) embedded in another (the whole linguistic
							symbol sequence)? When we hold a paperback book - an edition of <i>Moby Dick</i>, for example - how many texts are
							represented in that physical object?</p></li>
				
			

			
				<h2>Some Preliminary Conclusions</h2>
				<p class="noindent">There is a type of thing called "text" which is a symbol or sequence of symbols
					that either directly represents language or can be resolved back into language
					by reversing an earlier, non-arbitrary transformation. In this mass noun sense,
					text exists, is independent of context, and independent of individual
					interpretation or experience. However, while text in the mass noun sense must be
					what makes up text in a count noun sense, there is no such thing as "a text"
					that is independent of context or of individual experience and interpretation.
					No linguistic symbol sequence is naturally "organic" or "unitary" (the
					adjectives used by the TEI Guidelines), though any complex sequence will have
					structural features that offer themselves as convenient boundaries. Nevertheless
					these boundaries are always artificial, as much recent work on genetic editions
					has shown.Particularly interesting examples are the work of Malte Rehbein
						on a medieval German town record book (2009), and of Justin Tonra on Thomas
						Moore's long poem "Lalla Rookh" (2009). In each case the multiplicity of
						symbol sequences that are candidates for being "a text" is striking.
					Being "a text" is a status we give some text in a particular context and at our
					choosing. In this sense "a text" is, as Renear and Dubin say in a somewhat
					similar context, "a matter of contingent social/linguistic circumstances" (2007
					p.8) and is thus - as they similarly concluded about three of the four FRBR
					Group 1 entity types - not a type but a role. In other words I suggest that
					being "a text" is not what Guarino and Welty would term a <i>rigid property</i> of any instance of text in its mass noun
						sense.Guarino and Welty define a rigid property as "a property that is
						essential to all its instances" where by "essential" they follow Lowe in
						saying that "an essential property of an object … [is one where] the object
						has that property always and in every possible world" (2001 p.57). An
						example of a rigid property that they use several times is PERSON: "if x is
						an instance of PERSON, it must be an instance of PERSON in every possible
						world" (2001 p.57). They contrast PERSON with STUDENT; STUDENT is a property
						an entity can have and then not have without the entity changing: the same
						is not true of PERSON. A good deal of ontological work needs to be
					done, however, before this can be asserted with confidence. </p>
