        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="noindent">Digital Humanities (DH) has been described as an 'emerging' field for some time now but
          many (Borgman 2009; Friedlander 2009; Presner 2009) agree that this is a crucial moment
          for the discipline. The DH community now has established research methods, scholarly
          conferences and journals (Borgman 2009), DH centres and labs (Svensson 2010; van den
          Heuvel et al. 2010) and MA studies (Clement 2010). However, it could be argued that an
          important area for further development is the true internalization of the DH community. Up
          to now much of the discussion has centered on DH projects in a handful of mainly English
          speaking countries (Terras 2006). In order to consolidate as a discipline, an important
          challenge for the DH community is to extend its international reach and incorporate work
          from a broader range of academic institutions and languages.</p>
        <p class="noindent">One of the main issues of course, is attempting to integrate with groups of scholars that
          have not necessarily identified themselves yet as a community or do not even know that DH
          exists. Our project has four main objectives: 
            <li>raise awareness about DH</li>
            <li>identify key scholars and projects</li>
            <li>investigate key local issues in the development of DH projects</li>
            <li>consolidate a community and find ways of linking with the international DH
              community</li>
           The aim of this paper is to present our initial experience with two workshops
          as a methodological approach to investigating DH work in an unknown landscape and present
          a preliminary report on the DH situation in Mexico in particular.</p>
        <p class="noindent">To our knowledge this type of work has not been done before, in particular for Latin
          America. The fact that there has been little participation of Latin American scholars does
          not necessarily imply that no DH work is being done in this region but could be rather a
          lack of connection with the DH community. Japan for example, reports that despite having a
          long tradition in DH projects, one problem has been cooperating with similar projects
          overseas (Muller 2010).</p>
      
      
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p class="noindent">It is well documented that finding digital humanities resources (Dunning 2006; Pappa et
          al. 2006, Warwick et al 2006) and DH tools (Juola 2008) can be a difficult task and
          charting an unknown territory poses further challenges. We decided that workshops would
          allow us to both raise awareness of DH as well as serving as exploratory method to
          identify key scholars, projects and local issues. Additionally time and financial
          constraints were a major factor. At a later date we hope to use more quantitative methods
          such as a national survey.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Two workshops were carried out at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). As
          there is no record of DH activity in Mexico it was difficult to define where to start and
          so we relied heavily on personal experience and contacts to produce a list of possible
          participants. We contacted everybody we knew who had experience working on a DH project
          and asked them in turn to invite other participants in order to generate a snowball
          effect. The invitation included a very broad definition of DH projects. The workshops
          generated a large amount of interest and were well attended.</p>
        <p class="noindent">In order to provide a framework for the discussion we identified seven key topics from
          the literature: 
            <li>organizational context including institutional recognition and support (Siemens et
              al. 2010; Warwick 2008b)</li>
            <li>planning and development intellectual</li>
            <li>property and copyright (Rehm 2007); human resources and training (Warwick
              2009)</li>
            <li>dissemination and use (Warwick 2008a)</li>
            <li>completion and sustainability (Brown et al. 2009; Kretzschmar 2009; Sewell
              2009)</li>
            <li>digital humanist career (Siemens et al. 2010).</li>
          </p>
        <p class="noindent">These topics were addressed as a series of questions which participants answered
          reflecting on their particular experience and the projects they had worked on.</p>
      
      
        <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
        <p class="noindent">The first workshop had fifteen participants and the second twelve. Table 1 shows a
          breakdown of participants by subject. Examples of the types of DH projects carried out by
          the participants were digital collections and libraries (modern short novels and poetry,
          XIX century manuscripts marked in TEI), linguistics (text mining, corpus building, corpus
          of Mexican Spanish), digital images (research in pre Hispanic mural paintings,
          visualization archeological sites) and Anthropology (sound files for linguistics research
          indigenous languages). Almost all participants were project leaders, with the exception of
          two programmers, one MA publishing student and one graphic designer.</p>

        <p class="noindent">Of the people attending only a few were aware of the field of DH. Some had links with
          international projects (such as Biblioteca Virtual Cervantes) but in general most work was
          local and individual. Participants were pleased to discover "that there are other people
          like me".</p>
        <p class="noindent">Almost all projects are personal and not institutional initiatives. Several scholars
          remarked that university authorities had a vague idea of the importance of registering and
          managing digital materials but that this institutional support in practice lacked coherent
          policies or structures for them to have any real impact. None of the projects for example,
          had any specific physical location assigned and many had to improvise working spaces in
          order to cope with human resources and equipment.</p>
        <p class="noindent">A few people remarked however that working marginally was actually a good thing. "Being
          ignored can also be an advantage. Being independent and invisible to the institution
          allows you to be dynamic and creative".</p>
        <p class="noindent">Surprisingly, funding was not a problem for any of the projects. Most scholars applied
          and received funding from government or the UNAM. However, quantities were not
          particularly large (around 15,000 US dollars) and no project had permanent institutional
          funding. Participants did not mention a lack of access to computational technologies which
          had been suggested as a possible problem for DH projects in developing countries (Terras
          2006).</p>
        <p class="noindent">Projects were rarely documented with the exception of Linguistics. This is similar to
          other DH projects worldwide (Warwick 2009). Due to one to three year funding periods many
          felt that they were in a race against time to complete and documentation was left out.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Finding, training and retaining human resources are also key issues. All participants
          agreed that it is difficult to find human resources with the necessary skills and training
          was required. Additionally participants themselves went through a steep learning process
          whilst developing their project and found little learning support. In terms of training in
          Mexico there are no DH centres or courses. However, a couple of MA DH related classes are
          in development. Sharing information and pooling resources was considered fundamental
          towards developing the field. Participants noted the urgent need to compile best practice
          and guidelines as there seemed to be duplication of efforts and no communication.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Long term sustainability of resources is a major issue. For example, many scholars had
          purchased their own server to host the project as there are no university guidelines for
          hosting projects. However, it is not clear what will happen once the servers have to be
          replaced, or if the researcher left the university. In other cases, projects were hosted
          at the Computing Services department but usually as a personal rather than a formal
          collaboration. Others have hosted their projects on external servers, sometimes even at
          their own personal expense. As one participant remarked "when does a project become a
          university service and therefore somebody else's responsibility?" This is a common issue
          for DH (Brown et al. 2009; Kretzschmar 2009; Sewell 2009). We detected a notable absence
          of the library community whose skills are essential to these issues. Participants were
          aware of preservation but had not addressed the issue at all.</p>
        <p class="noindent">Another major issue was evaluation and recognition of DH work. Many felt that their work,
          although funded, was later not taken into account for evaluation purposes. However, it was
          also noted that it is difficult for evaluation committees who have no experience or
          knowledge about these types of projects to assess them. Many had worked individually with
          their departmental boards but it was agreed that providing tools, acting as a consultative
          body and lobbying collectively would be a more effective approach.</p>
      
      
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p class="noindent">Results from the workshop indicate that forming a DH community is possible as we found
          sufficient projects, scholars and interest to sustain a working group. All participants
          were enthusiastic about forming part of a local DH group. Workshops were by invitation
          only but have since resulted in other DH scholars coming forward and wanting to
          participate. Initial results indicate that issues and challenges regarding DH projects are
          similar to other countries and collaboration would be possible and fruitful. However, with
          some issues such as university and governmental recognition and support, guidelines and
          best practices and community awareness there appears to be a significant lag behind other
          countries. One main difference is the almost complete absence of the library community and
          this issue should be addressed. Main challenges are now: to discover and register more
          research and projects; develop best practices and guidelines in Spanish; incorporate the
          library community, build a directory of DH scholars; expand the group and develop
          mechanisms to increase national and international collaboration. In the next few months we
          will continue to work on more specific actions and report on them in due course.</p>
