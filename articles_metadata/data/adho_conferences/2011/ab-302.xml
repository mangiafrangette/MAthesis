                <p class="noindent">This paper presents preliminary results on using computational analysis to
                    understand the representations and constructions of gender and the body in fairy
                    tales. While scholarship on contemporary fairy tales utilizes various
                    cutting-edge theories, ranging from postmodern narrative to feminist theories of
                    gender performance (Bacchilega 1997, Benson 2008, Smith 2007, and Tiffin 2009),
                    little of the research on canonical fairy tales or oral folktales incorporates
                    these recent theories. Additionally, folkloristic research on fairy tales,
                    whether contemporary or traditional, would benefit from incorporating
                    computational methods such as network analysis. These methods allow scholars to
                    test their theories more quickly and empirically.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Our research utilizes nearly three hundred canonical fairy tales and oral
                    folktales, deemed canonical because they are from well-known collectors such as
                    the Brothers Grimm, or because the tales are examples of well-known plots
                    spanning time and space in Europe (such as “Snow White” and “Cinderella”). We
                    combine textual and network analysis with discipline-specific expert oversight
                    for a large-scale, theoretically informed discussion on gender and the body that
                    would not be possible without both in tandem. A feminist critique of fairy tales
                    is predicated upon the notion that fairy tales construct and represent bodies
                    differently according to gender, yet no studies have shown whether this
                    difference actually exists in canonical tales, or have addressed what this
                    difference would mean for studies of cultural values and narrative strategies
                    (Bottigheimer 1987, Haase 2004, and Stone 2008). Computational analysis of how
                    bodies and body parts are depicted in the text provides empirical evidence
                    against which this and other aspects of feminist theory can be tested.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Humanities scholars have already established a vast theoretical and
                    methodological framework for interpreting texts, and they ought to be able to
                    view their data in the context of those theories developed within their
                    disciplines. This study combines traditional critical analysis with
                    computational tools in an attempt to utilize the best of both worlds.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Data</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Our analysis uses a hand-coded database representing a geographically and
                    temporally diverse sample of tales. Careful attention was paid to the tale
                    tellers and collectors for further study of the context in which bodies are
                    depicted.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Fairy tales as a genre span oral, communal performances and literary,
                    single-author renditions. In order to represent this spectrum, our database
                    tracks specific references to bodies in six tale collections. We collected 13
                    data points from nearly three hundred tales (Tale, Collection, Author, Teller,
                    Collector, Year of Writing/Collecting, Year of Publication, Tale Type, Region,
                    Original Language, Gender of Teller/Writer, Gender of Collector, Gender of
                    Editor) and categorized another 14 data points for every mention of a body in
                    each tale, some evident in the texts (Noun, Adjective, Surrounding Text, Page
                    Number, Gender, Young/Old, High/Low, Quoted Speech, Skin Tone) and some
                    requiring interpretation (Positive/Negative value, Grotesque, Violence, Nudity,
                    Move).</p>
                <p class="noindent">The database variables were chosen in light of pre-existing work on structure and
                    theory, creating a layer of interpreted data that would not be found in
                    full-text analysis alone. The “Tale Type” classification system gives tale plots
                    numbers so that their transmission can be traced as tales migrate across
                    linguistic and national boundaries. This is what allows us to generalize about
                    the worldview contained within the tales, as the same plot with variations
                    occurs between multiple ethnic groups. The concept of “Moves” breaks up tale
                    plots into 5 distinctive plot pieces based on folkloristic theory of how tales
                    are structured.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p class="noindent">We use co-occurrence and vector analysis to explore the database. Each field is
                    compared against several others in order to find correlations. For example,
                    “beautiful” may only be referenced with young women, or old rich men may only
                    appear in tales from certain tellers. Using dimensionality reduction, we can
                    find which body parts tend to be discussed in tandem in various situations. We
                    also explore how the representations of bodies change throughout the plots of
                    tales using Bengt Holbek’s “Moves.” Holbek built on the work of Vladimir Propp,
                    who identified the most important plot points in sequence that could occur in a
                    fairy tale (31 points, or “functions,” total) (Holbek 1998). Holbek condensed
                    Propp’s functions into five “Moves,” or clusters of thematic actions that move
                    the tale’s plot forward.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Finally, networks of database data are generated and analyzed to test the
                    hypothesis that fairy tales construct bodies differently according to gender.
                    This analysis serves both as empirical evidence to test a theory and also as an
                    exploratory tool, revealing possible correlations or links between body
                    representations that are not immediately apparent in the texts.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Folklorists approach fairy tale interpretation in many ways: ethnographic
                    approaches seek connections between the taletellers’ lives and the tales’
                    content; historical approaches search for and analyze the origins and diffusion
                    of tales; structural analyses seek to understand the underlying narrative of the
                    tales; psychological approaches search for latent meaning in the tales; and
                    feminist and sociohistorical approaches interpret the meanings of the tales as
                    they relate to, convey values from, and inculcate values of the social world.
                    Feminist scholars have been particularly active in critiquing the normative
                    beauty scripts and gender roles promoted in fairy tales. This study investigates
                    how gender roles are constructed and situated in fairy tales, which is why we
                    encoded categories to investigate links between gender, age, and social
                    position, as well as where in the tale’s structure these social values are
                    relevant. We also hope to obtain information about how female and male bodies
                    are valued differently, hence the relevance of variables like “grotesque”.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Second-wave feminists such as Simone Beauvoir developed the notion of the
                    universal masculine perspective, the idea that in Western culture, the public,
                    unmarked, assumed universal position is in fact specifically male. Our data
                    supports this assertion in terms of female bodies being marked within fairy
                    tales, but we also believe that the same principle applies to the age of bodies.
                    Youthful bodies are assumed to be the unmarked universal category in fairy
                    tales.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The descriptions of old bodies are strikingly polarized: old people are more
                    likely than young to be described as evil or good, wicked or wise. These
                    findings suggest that old bodies must be differentiated in fairy tales, because
                    they are no longer in the supposedly universal category of youth. Old bodies are
                    qualified with more descriptions in order to give audiences a sense of who these
                    characters are, since they don’t fall into the category of the youthful
                    protagonist, with whom listeners are supposed to easily identify. If the bodies
                    in fairy tales had the same meanings across age and gender, we would have seen a
                    proportional relationship between the number of references to types of bodies,
                    and the number of adjectival descriptions attached to each. However, the data
                    shows that young men are associated with adjectival descriptions less frequently
                    than any other type of body. Old women, in contrast, are associated with
                    adjectival descriptions more than any other grouping. Further, a wider variety
                    of adjectives are used to qualify old bodies than young compared to the
                    proportion they are mentioned. Figure 1 shows a sample of which
                    adjectives are associated with mentions of various bodies.

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Our method of layering computational analysis atop previous theoretical research
                    can be used as a template for further studies, especially those of other folk
                    narrative genres like legends or ballads. Some of the most intriguing questions
                    in folklore research pertain to how verbal expressive genres relate to the lived
                    experiences of their performers—and a method for digitizing and interpreting
                    these texts could yield valuable insights.</p>
                <p class="noindent">As digitization is interpretation (Tarte 2010), it is necessary to be especially
                    careful and theoretically-grounded when choosing variables and selecting exactly
                    what data will populate the fields. The scholar must also decide the most
                    fruitful analyses to run on the data available. These studies ought to also
                    include computational analyses that are not linked to previous critical theories
                    (like word frequency or co-occurrence), however, in order to check against
                    biases which might creep into variable choice. The ultimate goal is to turn
                    well-researched, theoretically sound scholarly observations into machine
                    actionable data which can be analyzed to test the scholar’s hypotheses and open
                    the door for future studies.</p>
