            <h2>Introduction </h2>

            <p class="noindent">Linguistics is facing the challenge of many other sciences as it continues to grow
               into increasingly complex subfields, each with its own separate or overarching
               branches. While linguists are certainly aware of the overall structure of the
               research field, they cannot follow all developments other than those of their
               subfields. It is thus important to help specialists but also newcomers alike to
               bushwhack through evolved or unknown territory of linguistic data. </p>

            <p class="noindent">A considerable amount of research data in linguistics is described with metadata.
               While studies described and published in archived journals and conference proceedings
               receive a quite homogeneous set of metadata tags — e.g., <i>author</i>, <i>title</i>, <i>publisher</i> —,
               this does not hold for the empirical data and analyses that underlie such studies.
               Moreover, lexicons, grammars, experimental data, and other types of resources come in
               different forms; and to make things worse, their description in terms of metadata is
               also not uniform, if existing at all. </p>

            <p class="noindent">These problems are well-known and there are now a number of international initiatives
               — e.g., CLARIN, FlareNet, MetaNet, DARIAH — to build infrastructures for managing
               linguistic resources. The NaLiDa project, funded by the German Research Foundation,
               aims at facilitating the management and access to linguistic resources originating
               from German research institutions. In cooperation with the German SFB 833 research
               center, we are developing a combination of <i>faceted</i> and <i>full-text search</i> to give <i>integrated</i>
               access through heterogeneous metadata sets. Our approach is supported by a central
               registry for metadata field descriptors, and a component repository for structured
               groups of data categories as larger building blocks. </p>

         

         
            <h2>State of Affairs</h2>

            <p class="noindent">An increasing number of research institutions in linguistics is systematically
               archiving research data and making such data publicly available. Users can access
               such archives via institution-specific websites or purpose-built software where
               resources can be searched and, in part, downloaded. Some institutions provide access
               to their archives via OAI-PMH so that the archives’ public content can be harvested
               and fed into the metadata services of data centers in the community. </p>

            <p class="noindent">The metadata provided by the various institutions differ not only in quantity and
               quality but also in the format of description, as Fig. 1 illustrates. Typically, a
               research organization designs a metadata schema that it deems to serve best its
               institutional setting and the number and types of resources it hosts. Different
               organizations will likely yield various schemas with their own structure and
               terminology for the schemas’ nodes. Such semantic heterogeneity may be complemented
               by syntactic heterogeneity as formats may vary (e.g., ASCII, relational database
               format, XML). An organization’s resources can thus be seen as a forest of trees of
               the same kind, whereas a tree — i.e., a description of one resource — may have
               deformations at the leafs as the result of not adhering to the schema. Moreover,
               trees will look rather naked when resources are described sparsely. </p>

            <p class="noindent"><p>

               </p>
            </p>
         

         
            <h2>Conceptual Setting </h2>

            <p class="noindent">While we expect research organizations to continue managing their research data in
               their respective ways, we ask them (i) to make their data public in a well-defined
               XML format to obtain syntactic uniformity, and (ii) to reformulate their schemas to
               adhere to CMDI (Component MetaData Infrastructure), see (Broeder et al. 2010), a
               component-based metadata model that makes use of predefined metadata components and
               the ISOcat data category registry (International Organization of Standardization
               2009). The organizations’ archive managers have the opportunity to redefine existing
               parts of their schema, but they can also choose to keep existing structures and
               terminologies. In this case the respective metadata descriptors need to be associated
               with their corresponding semantic points of references in ISOcat, being addressable
               via unique persistent identifiers. Moreover, archive managers can add new data
               categories to ISOcat’s private space for immediate availability, and initiate a
               standardization process to pave the way for their wider use. </p>

         
         
            <h2>Technological Setting </h2>

            
               <h2>Metadata Storage </h2>

               <p class="noindent">The storage of resource descriptions has to cope with a multitude of schemas the
                  descriptions adhere to. The use of a relational database would require a mapping
                  of all schemas to a single one, which is all but trivial. Instead, with CouchDB
                     [
         (<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org" target="blank">link</a>)
   ], a no-SQL database is being used
                  that stores arbitrarily structured documents rather than records of some fixed
                  form. The translation between the XML-based CMDI-format into CouchDB’s native JSON
                  format is structure-and information-preserving. </p>
            

            
               <h2>Faceted Search </h2>

               <p class="noindent">Facets serve to blaze the trail. Faceted search enables a user to find specific
                  trees, i.e., resource descriptions, in the various forests by specifying (some of)
                  their common properties. A facet partitions the search space where descriptions,
                  i.e., CouchDB documents, in the same cluster share the same facet value. The
                  selection of multiple facets corresponds to an intersection of clusters
                  identifying resources that have all selected facet values. Faceted search also
                  supplies a user with information about the number of documents in each cluster or
                  intersections thereof — the “mileage” of following a trail. In the presently
                  available data the following <i>unconditional</i> facets are
                  adequate for the various schemas describing linguistic resources: “organization”,
                  “modality”, “language”, “country”, “resourceType”, and “origin”. Facet values may
                  stem from open or controlled vocabularies; controlled vocabulary facets have a
                  stronger tendency to partition the search space into larger units, whereas open
                  vocabularies induce larger search space fragmentations. </p>

               <p class="noindent">Once faceted search has focused on a subset of resources, <i>conditional</i> facets allow the introduction of additional context-specific
                  navigational user aids. When users select the facet “resourceType” with value
                  “tool”, for instance, they restrict the search space to just encompass metadata
                  that describes language-processing tools. Here, the conditional facet “toolType”
                  is introduced that partitions the remaining search space according to the type of
                  tool, e.g., language parser, spell checker. Moreover, conditional facets help
                  lowering the complexity of computing search space clusters and their
                  intersections. </p>
            

            
               <h2>Mapping Facets to Nodes of the Various Schemas</h2>

               <p class="noindent">Metadata schemas vary in structure and terminology. Different names for nodes or
                  leafs may be used to elicit the same meaning, and identical names may be used for
                  semantically different concepts. This makes the mapping of facets to nodes of the
                  various tree types (cf. Fig. 2) rather difficult, and usually requires some
                  intricate knowledge of the metadata forests to be processed. When schemas make use
                  of the aforementioned data category registry ISOcat, such ambiguities can be
                  resolved automatically as names are linked to registry entries. </p>

               <p class="noindent">
                  <p>
                     <h2>Figure 2: Mapping facets to the individual parts of the resource
                        trees</h2>
                     <img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei/245/245_img_1.jpg" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-245.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei/245/245_img_1.jpg','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
                  </p>
               </p>


               <p class="noindent">Each facet corresponds to an elementary CouchDB view into the database of resource
                  documents. These views serve as a starting point for the generation of complex
                  views that correspond to the various possible navigational paths using facet
                  selection, thus implementing the faceted browser back-end. Elementary views and
                  complex views are generated automatically from a facet specification file, an
                  enriched textual encoding of the table in Fig. 2. </p>
            

            
               <h2>Full-text Search Support </h2>

               <p class="noindent">Data sets may have resources that are hard to find using faceted search alone.
                  This is true for resources with sparse metadata, or with descriptors that can
                  rarely be mapped to facets. We are therefore using CouchDB’s port to Lucene to
                  perform full-text search across all resources or search spaces restricted by prior
                  faceted search. </p>
            

            
               <h2>Front-end </h2>

               <p class="noindent">Fig. 3 depicts a screenshot of the NaLiDa faceted browser; it shows a search state
                  where users selected three facets (“country”, “modality”, “resourceType”) and
                  where the system displays an overview of the remaining search space in terms of
                  the facets, the number of resources available for each of their values, and access
                  to all documents selected so far. </p>

            <h2>Related Work and Conclusion </h2>

            <p class="noindent">Faceted search is gaining popularity as users can explore large data sets without an
               intricate understanding of metadata fields or schemas; they obtain an immediate
               overview of the search space and guidance how to conquer it. A faceted search access
               to language resources has been implemened by the last author [
         (<a href="http://www.clarin.eu/vlo" target="blank">link</a>)
   ] using Flamenco (Hearst 2006). Our new
               approach has four main advantages: CouchDB also stores the metadata documents (with
               varying schemas) and thus also serves as permanent storage; the use of conditional
               facets contributes to usability as only relevant facets are shown, guiding users’
               navigation; index generation accommodates for incremental updates on the metadata
