        <note type="abstract">This presentation will discuss how to get DH started at schools with few technical resources. To get around a lack of technology and technical confidence in my students I had them use smartphones and an open-source Ruby On Rails engine for harvesting Instagram photos to create a modern archive of Shaw University student life, called #myshawu. I will talk about the archive and the technology, display some of the results and trends of exposing low technology users to a digital project, and delve into how DH is an tool for teaching them the skills and critical thinking necessary for true digital empowerment. I will also touch on how the project has grown to include alumni, what it has done for my students, and how this project connects with the larger DH community.</note>

         <p>Over the past few years, the
literature on race in digital humanities has steadily grown. From various
articles in Debates in the Digital
Humanities to the development of Postcolonial Digital Humanities and MLA
E-Roundtable, “Assessing Race in Digital Humanities”, many have explored the
theoretical and activist potential of addressing race in DH. Simultaneously, venues
and projects like THATCamp and The Praxis Program have progressively pushed DH beyond
the bounds of research one institutes. However, much has yet to be said about the
complexities of involving students with digital
humanities at under-resourced institutions. Teaching humanities classes at Shaw University, the first
historically black college in the South, has given me an excellent opportunity to
do just that. </p>
        <p>This paper discusses how I dealt with a lack of technology and student confidence to create a modern
archive of Shaw University student life, called <ref type="url" target="http://myshawu.herokuapp.com/">#myshawu</ref>, by using smartphones and an
open-source Ruby On Rails engine for harvesting Instagram photos. Though the
assignment taught me the potential of DH as an empowering tool for my students to
tell their stories in a public venue, it ultimately convinced me that the
greatest hurdle to getting people of race involved in the field is not just exposure
to technology, but teaching them the skills and critical thinking necessary for
true digital empowerment.</p>
        <p>The idea for the
assignment began when I read the MacArthur Foundation report, “The Future of
Learning Institutions in a Digital Age.”<ref target="n1" rend="sup">1</ref> In the report, Cathy Davidson and
David Goldberg disclose a sobering reality: “Despite government pronouncements
to the contrary, ‘digital divide’ is not just an old concept but a current
reality” (Davidson and Goldberg 20). The vast public acceptance of a so-called
Internet Generation or Generation Y ignores the very real tech fluency
differences that often exist along class and race lines. Siva Vaidhyanathan points
out just how detrimental this assumption is for underprivileged students in his
essay, “Generational Myth”: “to assume an entire generation is ‘born digital’
willfully ignores the vast range of skills, knowledge, and experience of many
segments of society. It ignores the needs and perspectives of those young
people who are not socially or financially privileged. It presumes a level
playing field and equal access to time, knowledge, skills, and technologies.”<ref target="n2" rend="sup">2</ref></p>
        <p>My experience teaching at
one of the country’s first HBCUs confirms the cautionary words of Davidson,
Goldberg, and Vaidhyanathan. Additionally, when I came across Adeline Koh’s “Race and Digital
Humanities: An Introduction” HASTAC presentation, Alan Liu’s “Where is the
Cultural Criticism in Digital Humanities”, and other articles addressing the issue of DH and race, I began to wonder what digital humanities could do for my students. Could a DH project be a way to bridge this digital divide? Could a DH project be done with such limited resources?</p>
        <p>Not only do many of my students lack technological fluency, many of them don't own computers, there are few computers labs on Shaw's campus, and the university has no technology unit that students or myself can turn to for help. My struggle with these limitations coincided with an interesting project being done at a neighboring institution. NCSU Libraries was using mobile devices to have students generate an archive of its new library in a project called my #huntlibrary. A few conversations and a partnership later, #myshawu was born.</p>
        <p>#myshawu is a repository
of student-generated images collected from Shaw’s first-year, almost exclusively
first-generation students during a one-semester basic writing course into which
90% of Shaw’s incoming freshman are placed. We bridged some digital access
hurdles by using largely free tools and open source software. Students were already utilizing Instagram, an
app accessible to most of them through their smartphones, a familiarity which
lessened the learning curve and gave students the confidence to dive into the assignment.
To gather all these images, I spun up an app which uses <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/lentil">Lentil</ref>, the Rails engine that drives My #huntlibrary, on
a free hosting service, <ref type="url" target="https://www.heroku.com/about">Heroku</ref>.
All the students had to do was use their Instagram accounts, take photos of
their lives around campus, and tag them “#myshawu”. Through these simple steps,
students were able to represent themselves and share their images with other
students, the university community, their communities of origin, and the
public. As a companion to the photo collection, students published long-form,
photo-rich narratives on a class collaborative Wordpress blog of the same
title, #<ref type="url" target="http://myshawu.wordpress.com/">myshawu</ref>. These essays focused
on their photos and their understanding of themselves in relation to the
university and, hence, in relation to their academic identity. </p>

          <p>Fig. 1: A page of student-generated images from the #myshawu website.</p>
        </figure>
        <p>When students submitted
their Wordpress essays, they also completed a survey to indicate the level of
difficulty and the level enjoyment they experienced with the assignment. Out of 91 students who completed the
assignment, 14 had difficulty getting the required hardware, 10 had trouble
setting up required software accounts, and 15 students had problems using this software.
These numbers show the relative ease with which students were able to access
the necessary technology, an ease dependent on using personal and open-source
tech resources rather than non-existent institutional tech resources. Yet, many
of the students struggled to complete the assignment as successfully as I’d
hoped. Only about half the images that students used in their final essays on
Wordpress ended up on #myshawu, and a good many of these images were copied
from the Internet. However, 85% of the
students who completed the assignment said it was not difficult to take
pictures.</p>
        <p>There could be various
reasons for this discrepancy between confidence and successful execution, such as poor resiliency or effort, and/or inconsistent
classroom attendance. Yet despite some shortcomings, the unintended, often unquantifiable successes continue to emerge. As Shaw approaches its sesquicentennial and HBCU across the South consider closing their doors, the students involved with #myshawu are going to capture oral histories, chronicling in photos, video, and audio the stories of alumni so important to Shaw's history. The project has engaged many students beyond the classroom as they visit local history museums and inquire about the possibilities of exhibiting our work. They reimagine the project with me and ahead of me, asking for opportunities to use their pictures to raise funds to for my technology resources and for more campus events. </p>
       
        <p>Another facet of this
project shines a light on students’ perspective on social media and adds another
layer of complexity to the argument that media studies and DH scholars have
been posing about race and technology. Logan Hill, in “Beyond Access”, put it
best: “Universal access isn’t just about being able to surf the Web, it’s about
the ability to participate and compete in a technology-driven industry and
society” (29).<ref target="n3" rend="sup">3</ref> To have a wide range of students from all race and class
backgrounds succeed in this media-saturated society, we can’t just give them
new technologies to create content only their friends will consume. We need to
show them that the technologies they use every day can be harnessed to empower
their academic and professional lives.</p>
        <p>#myshawu has also taught
me the importance of digital humanities for helping my students develop a more critical perspective on technology. The full
scope of what these kinds of projects teaches us about DH, HBCU students, cultural representation and empowerment is still unfolding, but it’s clear through
collecting and analyzing data, student-generated reflective writing, and
evaluations, that digital tools like these cause necessary shifts in students’
understanding of their own agency, particularly the role that writing,
technology, and image creation can have on their power as scholars and
professionals. Unfortunately, largely due to financial constraints and the many needs pulling at institutions like Shaw, HBCUs are some of the most unlikely to support faculty technology training and least likely to have the resources to support digital projects. Yet DH tools belong in the hands of those who have the most at stake as they become invaluable tools for engagement and student success. That said, certain assitance is needed from the digital humanities community for these projects and these students to reach their full potential. Partnerships with other universities, academic technologists, and more accessible and flexible technologies are just some of the support that can be extended by the greater DH community to HBCUs like Shaw, thereby creating cross-institutional collaborations that highlight the strengths of all institutions. Then #myshawu can become just one effort in a larger movement towards developing a DH pedagogy that can be inclusively practiced without relying on the financial privilege so often synonymous with DH. </p>
