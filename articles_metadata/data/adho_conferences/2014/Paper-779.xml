        <head>1 Introduction</head>
        <p>In distributed systems literature the orthogonal but interdependent characteris- tics of <hi rend="italic">autonomy, distribution</hi> and <hi rend="italic">heterogeneity</hi> are used to classify distributed systems [1,2]. From a holistic perspective on the arts and humanities, collections have evolved over decades or centuries from highly autonomous disciplines and institutions and are widely spread, which resulted in heterogeneous perspectives and data models [3]. Despite its negative notion as <hi rend="italic">data integration problem</hi>, the term <hi rend="italic">heterogeneity</hi> also symbolizes the diversity of research methodologies within the disciplines of the arts and humanities. Resolving heterogeneity hence implies an abstraction from the specifics that are valuable for focused disciplinary and interdisciplinary research projects.</p>
        <p>Our approach presents a novel concept for data federation in the arts and
humanities, which focuses the needs of research projects as well as interdisci-
plinary and broad use-cases. We especially address the reusability of explicated
knowledge on correlations between schemata and digital collections and show
where domain experts are required to bridge semantic gaps.</p>
        <head>2 Background</head>
        <p>Approaches to data integration often follow the theoretical foundation expressed in [4] by employing the concept of a global view. While being highly distinctive in terms of their underlying concepts, established examples such as ISIDORE [5], OAIster [6] and Europeana [7] share the goal of facilitating access to a wide range of research data through integrated schemata or ontologies. Aside from broad services, an integration need that focuses on a specific topic and related research questions is addressed by the Steinheim Institute, which provides a search in the context of german-jewish history and judaism [8]</p>
        <p>Despite usability concerns in having to identify relevant services and accord- ingly collections, the reappearing need to overcome the same aspects of hetero- geneity in reaction to new use-cases is one of the problems we address.</p>
        <head>2.1 Use cases </head>
        <p>Our federation concept is primarily focused on the realization of the <hi rend="italic">DARIAH-
DE Generic Search (</hi>http://dev3.dariah.eu/search), which includes support for queries over large sets of unre-
lated collections (broad search) and tightly correlated data (deep search)—with
different information needs in mind: </p>
        <p>– <hi rend="italic">Broad search</hi>: Due to the quantity and distribution, the relevance of digital
collections for particular research questions is not easily assessable. A broad
view assists scholars in finding and evaluating possibly relevant data. Figure
1 shows an exemplary, collection-level aggregation of results based on term
statistics in the prototype of our search, which will be continuously extended
by other relevant visualization techniques (e.g. with respect to spacial and
temporal aspects).
</p>
        <p>– <hi rend="italic">Deep search</hi>: If the granularity of local data models can be used to formulate
more specific queries targeting structure and content (e.g. in search facets),
the deep search utilizes mappings specified in the <hi rend="italic">DARIAH-DE Schema Reg-
istry.</hi> Broad search continuously fades to deep search with an increasing
count and richness of mappings and hence typically smaller sets of selected
collections. </p>

          <graphic url="DH2014_548_332-1"/>
          <p>Fig. 1: Result aggregation in the generic search</p>
        </figure>
        <p>Despite the focus on the generic search with its virtual integration at query-time,
the proposed concept also addresses requirements of a materialized integration
of data: </p>
        <p>– <hi rend="italic">Data migration and consolidation</hi>: Traditional applications of data integra-
tion often do not require a dynamic adaption to selected collections, but de-
termine a set of relevant data sources and an appropriate integration schema
or ontology [4]. Examples include data migration induced by the introduction
of new information systems (e.g. replacement of outdated archive informa-
tion software) or the consolidation of selected data sources under a merged
schema for the purpose of interdisciplinary analysis and visualization e.g. in
the <hi rend="italic">DARIAH-DE GeoBrowser</hi> [9]. 







					</p>
        <head>2.2
Problem Definition
</head>
        <p>The common objective of data integration approaches is to resolve heterogeneity
on various levels: <hi rend="italic">Syntactical</hi> aspects such as the existence of different access
and encoding methods can be solved by technical means, whereas <hi rend="italic">structural
and semantic </hi>heterogeneity depend on the application of background knowledge
[1]. Despite continuing efforts in the fields of schema and ontology matching, the
manual intervention of domain experts—especially for large or complex schemata
and ontologies often found in the arts and humanities—has shown to be essential
to generate high-quality results [10].
</p>
        <p>The correlation of the used schemata and ontologies is an inherently complex
manual task in our context, which depends on the <hi rend="italic">fragmented and distributed
knowledge</hi> of individual disciplines, collections and scholars. Requiring a common
understanding, research projects concentrate knowledge about schemata and
semantics used in relevant collections and specify meanings and correlations. In
order to integrate the described data and establish technical interoperability, an
application of digital methods and tools is required. </p>
        <head>3 Concept</head>
        <p>Abstracting from aspects of technical and syntactical heterogeneity concerned with accessing, preprocessing and integrating data in a generic fashion, we aim to enable researchers to focus on those aspects of integration, that depend on their knowledge and expertise: the description and correlation of schemata and ontologies. Despite the immediate benefit for individual integration tasks, the centralized formalization and explication of semantics results in the significant advantage of <hi rend="italic">knowledge reusability</hi>.</p>
        <head>3.1 Semantic cluster</head>
        <p>The logical architecture of our idea is represented by a directed, weighed graph, where the schemata and ontologies are described by vertices, and mappings be- tween them are symbolized by edges. Whereas correlations between structural elements symbolize a relation of the described concepts (e.g. persons, locations) and could be considered undirected, more specific rules that are required for data transformation can be composed of non-reversible functions (e.g. the concate- nation of fields). For that reason, parallel edges are required for the description of both mapping directions. Differences of schemata in terms of their complex- ity and expressiveness reduce the achievable level of accumulated completeness, which is represented by the value of <hi rend="italic">cohesion</hi></p>
        <p>Figure 2 indicates how the cohesion between schemata can be utilized to sug- gest semantic clusters: C1, C2 and C3 could be the result of research projects, which needed a high level of mapping completeness between relevant schemata. By interrelating clusters or generically used schemata (S10), the expressed se- mantics can be reused in other contexts.</p>
        <head>3.2 Use-case orientation
</head>
        <p>Our example indicates the difference to the commonly found integration pattern
of a global ontology or schema. Despite its theoretical foundation, simplicity
and proven applicability for broad integration use-cases [5,6,7], we consider the
approach to be impracticable for a holistic context of the arts and humanities
because a global structure would either have to be an abstraction from collection
or discipline specifics or unmanageably complex.
</p>
        <p>Narrowing this context to individual domains or research projects, standards
could be elected as appropriate integrative structures. As exemplified in figure
2, the schemata S3, S5 and S8 form the integration baseline within our clusters
due to their cohesion with other schemata. Considering our <hi rend="italic">deep search and data
migration and consolidation</hi> use-cases, these schemata can be utilized to generate
a fine-grained view over selected collections accessible within the cluster. In order
to support interdisciplinary use-cases, clusters can be combined (symbolized by
the strong cohesion between S5 and S8) to resolve semantic gaps.
</p>
        <p>For broad use-cases we rely on the collaborative and continuous emergence
of schemata or ontologies (compare S10) within our federation that are used to
connect the clusters on the coarse levels sufficient for broad use-cases. </p>

        </figure>

        <head>3.2 Use-case orientation3.3 Scalability considerations</head>
        <p>The simplicity of traditional data integration emerges as new local schemata are added to the system and hence an appropriate mapping target needs to be identified. To ensure extensibility and scalability, our proposed federation concept depends on two strategies:</p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">Cluster globals</hi>: The concept of semantic clusters builds on the existence or ad- vancement of standards that are considered as appropriate common perspectives by research communities. Although clusters are not predetermined but expected to evolve, established standards such as the <hi rend="italic">CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) </hi>or the <hi rend="italic">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guildelines</hi> could be iden- tified as initial cluster schemata, which can be mapped in a generic fashion [11]. As new schemata need to be added, the standard which promises to achieve the highest completeness is selected to be mapped.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">Model inheritance</hi>: Our proposal includes an approach to specify the actual usage of schemata more precisely than it is possible at the level of generic cross- walks. Figure 3 shows the exemplary derivation of the Dublin Core element dc:coverage to resolve an encapsulated substructure. Mappings are inherited to correlate the refined elements or to specify detailed data transformation rules. As derived schemata are related to their parent, generic mappings remain valid and can be utilized if specific rules are missing.</p>

        <head>4 Conclusion</head>
        <p>As we abstract from technical aspects of heterogeneity and reuse the valuable disciplinary knowledge explicated in terms of correlations, processing and trans- formation rules, the efforts required for integrating research data can be sig- nificantly reduced. Another important aspect that is currently being evaluatedconsists in appropriate techniques for the visualization of our federation concept and system. After all, domain experts need to be able to recognize clusters, im- portant schemata and ontologies as well as their correlations in order to identify semantic gaps and to collaboratively fill them.</p>
