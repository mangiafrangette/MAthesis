<p><span class="font4">Originally funded by a startup grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Dictionnaire Vivant de la Langue Française</span><span class="font4"> </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">(DVLF</span><span class="font4">) is&nbsp;an experimental approach to dictionary compilation&nbsp;that aims to push the boundaries of what typical&nbsp;dictionaries offer. It is being developed as an&nbsp;interactive, community-oriented alternative to&nbsp;traditional methods of French lexicography, bringing&nbsp;together user-submitted definitions and definitions&nbsp;from standard French dictionaries (multiple editions&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française,&nbsp;Dictionnaire de Littré...),</span><span class="font4"> synonyms, pronunciation, as&nbsp;well as a wealth of information on word usage through&nbsp;the use of various computational methods. Our poster&nbsp;will show the DVLF’s functionality, as well as&nbsp;demonstrate its originality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fundamentally, the most important aspect of the DVLF is that it aims to create an environment in which&nbsp;its user community rates, critiques, and adds to the&nbsp;collection’s resources as it sees fit. As such, we have&nbsp;made a conscious effort to facilitate community&nbsp;engagement by allowing users to contribute to most&nbsp;sections of our website: definitions, usage examples,&nbsp;synonyms and antonyms. To date, users have added or&nbsp;submitted definitions/examples for hundreds of&nbsp;words, including </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">alexithymie</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">digiscopie</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">foucade</span><span class="font4">,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nyctalope</span><span class="font4">. The new version of our site (released&nbsp;in January 2017) has been further enhanced to enable&nbsp;such engagement thanks to more visible links inviting&nbsp;users to contribute content, as well as a new&nbsp;responsive interface designed to work equally well on&nbsp;mobile devices and desktop computers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to attract and engage the largest possible user community, the DVLF is entirely free and open&nbsp;source, and requires no registration. Internet users at&nbsp;large can access the site's resources and contribute&nbsp;material. The DVLF thus tries to adapt to changing&nbsp;word usage and incorporate neologisms so that users&nbsp;will be able to select the word senses and usage&nbsp;examples that they feel are most consistent with&nbsp;contemporary usage. In this manner, the DVLF mirrors&nbsp;the social and evolving nature of language, expanding&nbsp;upon the dictionary's traditionally normative role by&nbsp;giving French speakers and learners access to&nbsp;lexicographic tools so that they might interact with the&nbsp;evolving meaning of words and determine their own&nbsp;understanding of the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over the last year, ARTFL has been working to develop and improve the DVLF. We noticed from&nbsp;statistics gathered from Google Analytics that our&nbsp;community of users was very diverse, accessing our&nbsp;website from Morocco, Tunisia, Canada, and many&nbsp;other francophone and non-francophone countries.&nbsp;This led us to focus a large part of our effort on&nbsp;diversifying content, including usage examples from a&nbsp;wider range of francophone sources in order to&nbsp;provide more coherent descriptions of emerging word&nbsp;usage from Francophone communities around the&nbsp;world, and therefore attract a larger global user base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over the course of this redevelopment effort, we decided to rewrite the entire codebase given the&nbsp;various reliability and performance issues we had&nbsp;experienced, switching from a Python-only&nbsp;infrastructure to a Go/Javascript environment. We&nbsp;have also worked to add additional contextual&nbsp;information to our content, starting with the most&nbsp;frequent collocates of any given word based a corpus&nbsp;of over 7,000 texts of French literature from the&nbsp;Middle-Ages to the late 20th century. Additionally,&nbsp;following the lead of recent work in computational&nbsp;linguistics and natural language processing, we also&nbsp;now provide the nearest neighbors based on the&nbsp;computation of word vectors using a word-embedding&nbsp;technique called Swivel. While we could have used&nbsp;alternative algorithms such as word2vec or Glove, we&nbsp;decided to use Swivel because it does not solely rely</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">only on word co-occurrence to construct vectors. The benefit of Swivel's approach is that it can yield similar&nbsp;words that do not actually occur together in the corpus&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Shazeer et al, 2016)</span><span class="font4">, which we thought was a&nbsp;valuable approach given that our dictionaries span&nbsp;across multiple centuries. To generate this word&nbsp;vector model, we used the same 7,000 texts and then&nbsp;extracted the top 20 words for every headword in our&nbsp;dictionary index, which is now displayed on the new&nbsp;version of our site.</span></p><div><img src="442_files/442-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:185pt;"/>
