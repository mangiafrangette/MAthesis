<p><span class="font1">The foundation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Death by Numbers: Bills of Mortality in Early Modern London</span><span class="font1"> is the construction&nbsp;of a relational database containing plague mortality&nbsp;information from the London Bills of Mortality in all&nbsp;their varying levels of granularity. Plague first entered&nbsp;England in 1348, as part of a continent-wide epidemic&nbsp;that killed approximately one third of the population&nbsp;of Europe. Thereafter, England suffered continuous&nbsp;outbreaks of plague through 1679, and fear of plague&nbsp;lasted well into the eighteenth century. The most well-documented epidemics of the early modern era were&nbsp;in England's cities, particularly London, which&nbsp;suffered six major epidemics in the century between&nbsp;1563 and 1665, and lost an estimated 225,000 people&nbsp;to plague. During the mid-sixteenth century, in&nbsp;response to these epidemics, some city officials began&nbsp;to compile numerical summaries of local deaths and&nbsp;circulated those mortality statistics in manuscript&nbsp;form. By the turn of the seventeenth century, there&nbsp;was enough popular interest in these numbers that&nbsp;officials in the city of London began publishing weekly&nbsp;mortality statistics in a series known as the Bills of&nbsp;Mortality. The weekly bills included a parish-byparish list of total deaths and plague deaths, along with&nbsp;running tallies of city-wide christenings, deaths&nbsp;broken down by a variety of causes, and parishes&nbsp;infected with plague. London's weekly bills were also&nbsp;supplemented annually with a general account of the&nbsp;preceding year, published on the Thursday before&nbsp;Christmas. Over the first half of the seventeenth&nbsp;century, more parishes were added to the bills,&nbsp;including the parishes in surrounding counties and in&nbsp;the neighboring city of Westminster, until the &quot;Bills of&nbsp;Mortality&quot; formed a recognized geographical unit that&nbsp;included all of London and its suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bills of Mortality are thus a vital source of information about the population of seventeenth- and&nbsp;eighteenth-century London. They have been analyzed&nbsp;by politicians, demographers, historians, and&nbsp;epidemiologists as early as the seventeenth century&nbsp;itself, but currently only the bills from a few select&nbsp;epidemic years are available online. Construction of&nbsp;the Bills of Mortality database is thus a vital step for&nbsp;both this project and for future digital humanists&nbsp;interested in the bills. After the construction of this&nbsp;database, this project will use network analysis to&nbsp;examine the transmission of plague between residents&nbsp;of London's parishes during both famous epidemic&nbsp;outbreaks and the periods of endemic plague that&nbsp;followed them. Subjects of particular interest in this&nbsp;analysis include the change in infection patterns over&nbsp;time, how the infrastructural and geographical&nbsp;features of the city act as barriers or &quot;highways&quot; to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">infection, and the devastating impact of - and slow recovery from - the Great Fire of London while plague&nbsp;was still active in the city. The project will also include&nbsp;a mapping component to visualize mortality trends by&nbsp;parish over time, with particular interest in the full&nbsp;duration of epidemics as opposed to each epidemic's&nbsp;highest mortality (and highest profile) year.&nbsp;Eventually the Bills of Mortality database, as well as&nbsp;materials associated with the network analysis and&nbsp;visualizations, will be made freely available online in&nbsp;accessible, sustainable formats for reuse by other&nbsp;members of the scholarly community.</span></p>
