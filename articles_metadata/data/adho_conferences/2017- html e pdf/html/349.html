<p><span class="font2">This poster demonstrates my digital history project, “The Fillmore Boys School in 1877: Racial Integration,&nbsp;Creoles of Color and the End of Reconstruction in New&nbsp;Orleans,” (<a href="http://fillmoreschool.web.unc.edu">http://fillmoreschool.web.unc.edu</a>) which&nbsp;visualizes how, in 1877, Creoles of color, a group of&nbsp;francophone Catholics of interracial descent,&nbsp;responded to the city school board’s racial segregation&nbsp;plan. Through geo-spatial analysis and virtual&nbsp;representation of information of the Fillmore School&nbsp;student register, the project examines Creole families’&nbsp;resistance to segregation and facilitates public&nbsp;understanding of ambiguous racial identities that&nbsp;become often invisible in the black and white racial&nbsp;dichotomy of United States history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Fillmore School served as a catalyst for Creoles’ ideal of racial equality and the center of their&nbsp;resistance to segregation. During Reconstruction,&nbsp;Creoles of color led the legal, political and grassroots&nbsp;campaign that ultimately resulted in the&nbsp;desegregation of approximately one-third of the&nbsp;public schools in New Orleans between 1871 and&nbsp;1877. Fillmore was one of the integrated schools that&nbsp;many Creoles of color attended until the school board&nbsp;designated it as white-only in 1877. Its 1877 register&nbsp;contains 658 students’ individual information,&nbsp;including name, residential address, age, admission&nbsp;date, and parents’ name and their occupation. While&nbsp;the register does not list race, it includes notations of&nbsp;transfer to a “colored” school for 16 students. In&nbsp;addition, my digital research and mapping revealed&nbsp;that at least forty Creole students requested admission&nbsp;to the school as a sign of protest. This project thus&nbsp;demonstrates a complex process of segregation,&nbsp;resistance and racial identities among Creoles of color&nbsp;in New Orleans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The project has undergone four processes: 1) transcription, 2) data collection, 3) mapping, and 4)&nbsp;website building. First, I digitized the entire 1877&nbsp;Fillmore School student data. Second, I searched the&nbsp;1870 and 1880 censuses and city directory&nbsp;information of the students by using ancestry.com.&nbsp;Next, I deployed ArcGIS and geo-referenced the 1883&nbsp;Robinson Atlas, the most comprehensive map of New&nbsp;Orleans for the era, and collected students’ latitude-longitude information. I used ArcGIS because it&nbsp;allowed me to publish the data as an interactive map&nbsp;while simultaneously conducting geo-spatial analysis.&nbsp;The project processed 566 student data entries to be&nbsp;published as an interactive map to the public. Finally,&nbsp;I built a website to contextualize the map.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The main part of my poster demonstrates the ArcGIS map. It pays particular attention to the ways in which the map shows students’ residences with their&nbsp;variable racial information taken from the register, the&nbsp;1870 and 1880 censuses and city directories. The map&nbsp;displays the complex reality of segregation in New&nbsp;Orleans. The censuses classified many Creole students&nbsp;as mulatto or white. However, the census racial&nbsp;information does not always correlate with that of the&nbsp;school register. The poster also focuses on how the&nbsp;map represents multimedia information about Creoles&nbsp;of color and shows their admission attempts as a tactic&nbsp;to resist racial resegregation. I will also discuss&nbsp;challenges I faced in mapping, including the lack of&nbsp;complete data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poster also introduces my project website that offers a virtual space for users to consider responses&nbsp;among ordinary Creoles of color confronting&nbsp;segregation and understand the complicated history&nbsp;of race and ethnicities in the United States. The&nbsp;website currently offers Creole family narratives to&nbsp;further contextualize the map. It also provides a short&nbsp;history of the Fillmore School and school racial&nbsp;policies in New Orleans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last, this poster discusses the future plan for the project. First, I will deploy social network analysis of&nbsp;the Creole parents and children at Fillmore and&nbsp;examine how their close social relationships&nbsp;contributed to resistance. Second, I plan to examine&nbsp;the Fillmore School history in the twentieth century by&nbsp;using oral interviews to reflect another desegregation&nbsp;attempt during the civil rights movement in the 1960s.&nbsp;Overall, this poster argues for digital ways to&nbsp;illuminate ambiguous identities and a wide range of&nbsp;struggles against racism in the late nineteenth century&nbsp;United States and discusses how digital humanities&nbsp;enrich historical research.</span></p>
