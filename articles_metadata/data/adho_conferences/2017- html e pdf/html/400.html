<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Broad access to online digital humanities projects raises questions about who our audiences are and how we respond to their engagement&nbsp;with our work. Using Project Vox as a case study,&nbsp;we highlight motivations and implications for&nbsp;providing audiences more access to decisions&nbsp;that shape the evolution of a project. In doing so,&nbsp;we hope to encourage critical discussion about&nbsp;how we conceive, assess, and engage the diverse&nbsp;audiences of digital scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Digital humanities practitioners may be familiar with Bertolt Brecht's proposal that radio ought to become &quot;the finest possible communication apparatus in&nbsp;public life&quot;-- a medium that &quot;bring[s] the listener into&nbsp;a relationship instead of isolating him.&quot;(Brecht 1964)&nbsp;This thought is often cited as a visionary evocation of&nbsp;the internet, with all its potential for many-to-many&nbsp;communication and meaningful audience response.&nbsp;Yet even as Web 2.0 has realized this kind of open communication space, digital scholarly resources often&nbsp;have not tried to foster engagement with a broad audience. There are some obvious reasons for this tendency; esoteric subject matter comes to mind, as do&nbsp;limitations of time and resources. But audience diversity is generally taken to be the desirable and nearly&nbsp;inevitable outcome of &quot;the democratization of access .&nbsp;. . that Benjamin recognized as a feature of mechanical&nbsp;reproduction,&quot; (Unsworth 1996) so it seems incumbent upon project creators to think critically about&nbsp;how to engage a diverse audience -- especially when&nbsp;the perspectives of that audience may suggest new avenues of research, project development, or dissemination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Can a project carry out its intellectual mission while also adapting to the needs of an unexpected but&nbsp;engaged audience? Underlying that question is an&nbsp;even simpler one: why respond to and involve anyone&nbsp;other than one's intended audience? These questions&nbsp;are not new (Jewell 2009, see also Gibbs &amp; Owens,&nbsp;2012 and Robertson, 2012), but our answers to them&nbsp;become more vital amid greater access to, and more&nbsp;affordances to engage with, humanities scholarship.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> team is contending with such questions as we plan our next phase of development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> is a digital resource aimed at transforming the canon of modern philosophy, beginning with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">how philosophy is taught to undergraduates. To that end, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> provides resources for teaching and&nbsp;research focused on women philosophers traditionally excluded from the western philosophical canon.&nbsp;The content and mission of the site imply a fairly narrow audience-- instructors of undergraduate history&nbsp;of philosophy courses -- and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> team designed and built the site with those readers in mind.&nbsp;Yet something unexpected happened when the site&nbsp;launched in March 2015: by academic standards, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> went viral. Through wide sharing on social&nbsp;media and articles in scholarly and popular media (for&nbsp;a complete listing of citations and links to press coverage, see the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Project Vox publicity page</span><span class="font2">) it enjoyed a&nbsp;kind of publicity and uptake uncommon for a digital&nbsp;humanities venture, let alone a niche project aimed at&nbsp;a single discipline. A substantial part of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2">'s&nbsp;Twitter mentions could be traced back to a post on&nbsp;Feministing (which also accounted for significant traffic to the site, as captured through Google Analytics,&nbsp;Dusenbery 2015). Popular and scholarly media coverage included the Washington Post, the Times Higher&nbsp;Education Supplement, the London Times, and The Atlantic. Beyond the head-spinning gratification of positive public attention, the fact of this broader and unexpected audience invited us to think more critically&nbsp;about whether and how to accommodate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Naturally, it's easiest to ignore an emergent audience and continue to speak directly to an imagined group, regardless of the degree to which that group actually exists as a proportion of a site's readers. Andrew&nbsp;Jewell advocates this plan when he considers the audience of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Willa Cather Archive</span><span class="font2">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“How shall our editing practices change to address new audience needs?” I have considered this question&nbsp;for some time and with some seriousness, and my current response is this: How the hell should I know? . . .&nbsp;[M]y response to the diversified audience has been not&nbsp;to change my practices at all, but to continue to make&nbsp;content additions that address the needs of the audience I know and, frankly, care about the most: other&nbsp;Cather scholars and teachers. For me, being a central&nbsp;resource to the most informed audience is a sign of&nbsp;great success . (Jewell 2009)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But it is also possible to adapt, and despite his stay-the-course rhetoric, Jewell acknowledges that his &quot;understanding of audience diversity has inspired certain projects within the Cather Archive that address that&nbsp;diversity while also being useful for Cather scholars.&quot;&nbsp;(Jewell 2009). Finding exactly that kind of balance has&nbsp;become an unexpected but important part of our work&nbsp;on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In short, we want to adapt </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> to serve a broader, engaged community and support our core&nbsp;mission. This goal entails not only making </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">available as an open scholarly resource but also&nbsp;providing our audiences more access to and involvement in decisions that shape the evolution of the project. To cite one concrete example, a better understanding of our audience -- for instance, those who discovered our site through the Feministing tweets and&nbsp;posts -- may help determine the degree to which we&nbsp;acknowledge the English writer Mary Astell as an early&nbsp;feminist as well as a philosopher. In making such decisions, we want to clearly understand all of our audiences, their interests in our project, and how our mutual interests could be better aligned to improve and&nbsp;grow the site. Put another way, we want to cultivate&nbsp;the kind of audience-creator dynamic that Andrew&nbsp;Jewell cites as the impetus for creating a bibliography&nbsp;of Cather translations. This dynamic is also embodied&nbsp;in earlier instances, such as the Blake Archive for Humans website and Jon Saklofske's re-imagining of the&nbsp;Blake Archive via his NewRadial software. Both are&nbsp;concrete examples of how users of an openly accessible scholarly resource can have different ideas about&nbsp;the content and its use. Such phenomena force us to&nbsp;recognize divergences between intended and actual&nbsp;audiences and to consider whether we will respond&nbsp;(see Kirschenbaum, 2004; and Saklofske, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this talk, we will describe the data and methods </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> has used to identify and engage its audience (including Google Analytics data, targeted Qual-trics surveys, and collaboration with user experience&nbsp;professionals). This work is currently underway, and&nbsp;by summer 2017 we expect to share how these results&nbsp;are shaping the development of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox.</span><span class="font2"> We will&nbsp;also be able to report on the work of our outreach and&nbsp;assessment coordinator, who is instrumental in engaging our audience and assessing the site's impact. (The&nbsp;very fact of having an outreach and assessment coordinator suggests some of the resource implications for&nbsp;prioritizing audience engagement, and we look forward to discussing the decisions we have made and&nbsp;continue to weigh.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The questions of audience engagement are persistent and thorny, and they have been under-examined in DH scholarship. As Michael J. Kramer has recently&nbsp;noted, &quot;[o]ne shift in the digital humanities that needs&nbsp;more attention is the changing, often contested, understanding of audience . . . How do makers wish to treat&nbsp;their audiences?. . . Should they be reconstituted as fellow makers? As active respondents?&quot; (Kramer 2016).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Project Vox</span><span class="font2"> is a public-facing DH project working to engage a broad user base without abandoning its scholarly rationale. By analyzing what we know about our&nbsp;audiences and sharing how we act on that information,&nbsp;we hope to provide a report of general interest to the&nbsp;DH community. And in striving to be transparent and&nbsp;methodical, we hope that our critical, sustained selfassessment can help to elucidate some useful approaches to engaging diverse audiences, which we&nbsp;consider an inherently worthwhile goal of digital&nbsp;scholarship.</span></p>
