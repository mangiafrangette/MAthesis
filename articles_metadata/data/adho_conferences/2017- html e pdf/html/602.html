<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> is a web-based app for the digitization of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">manuscripts. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> is intended to automate the work of the textual critic of any handwritten text. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tex-tograf</span><span class="font0"> allows you to select a specific set (or “layer”) of&nbsp;edits to a text, to compare different iterations of the&nbsp;text, and ultimately to visualize the correlation between the final text and the process that stood behind&nbsp;it. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> is able to work with prose and poetry,&nbsp;with manuscripts and printed sources. A description&nbsp;of the project can be found on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">web page</span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The app allows you to upload an image of the manuscript, to enter the transcript of the manuscript, and to match specific parts of the transcript with where&nbsp;they appear on the page of the manuscript. You can&nbsp;also mark on the transcript the different stages of edits&nbsp;that were made. The app also enables you to see and&nbsp;highlight all text that was deleted, all text that was&nbsp;added, and all text that was initially deleted and subsequently restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All documents (scanned images and texts) are stored in a so-called “library”. Access to the documents&nbsp;depends on the documents' status - “public” or “private”. Private documents are visible only to the editor,&nbsp;public documents can be accessed by everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> allows its user to create complex documents that include manuscript images and their text versions. Text fields are searchable, allowing the user&nbsp;to find search results in the manuscript itself. Every&nbsp;manuscript image can be archived according to customized categories (whose handwriting, where it is&nbsp;currently stored, size of paper, pen or pencil, published or not published, etc).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> allows you to download documents from the library in TEI format. Texts can then be ordered in&nbsp;accordance with the user's version of the text. Often&nbsp;the text has a number of different versions, and the&nbsp;user has to find the right one and to collect all the corresponding manuscripts. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> makes this possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Different types of source documents connected to the work (outlines, synopses, the manuscripts themselves, printed editions) can be shown as an info-graphic, demonstrating visually the correlation between the different source documents. For example,&nbsp;this is a map of the early stages of Leo Tolstoy's work&nbsp;on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">War and Peace</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">displayed on the Textograf site</span><span class="font0">.</span></p><img src="602_files/602-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:107pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">The app was initially developed using the manuscripts of Leo Tolstoy: 200 pages (out of 5,000) from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">War and Peace</span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The map has two axes: the real time of Tolstoy's work (starting from 1863) and the fictional place and&nbsp;contents of the novel so you can see which episodes&nbsp;Tolstoy started with and how each part of the text&nbsp;came together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As of today, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> app is unique. It allows the user to work with manuscripts and texts in automatic or semi-automatic mode, meaning that the user&nbsp;can focus on the creative aspects of this work and become immersed in the manuscripts. Before the creation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0">, many of these functions had to be&nbsp;performed manually, such as establishing the link between text and image, and identifying the sequence of&nbsp;writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the process of developing the application, we had to convert the terms and methods of textual criticism in terms of electronic resources. For example, we&nbsp;had to establish the meaning of the word &quot;layer&quot;, or&nbsp;&quot;edit&quot;, and to show how to visualize it on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When we talk about the influence different inputs, we mean that any text has a complex history. For example, a poem may obtain its final form as a result of a&nbsp;long history of changes from one version to another.&nbsp;Thus, what stays in the archives will be several manuscripts that contain similar, but not identical versions&nbsp;of the same text. Earlier versions will influence the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">later ones. The &quot;text map&quot; shows the full history and evolution of the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> is designed to work with any paper-based sources. It could be both manuscripts and printed editions. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> is a computer programme&nbsp;editor and is designed to prepare in electronic form&nbsp;both critical and diplomatic editions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> can work with the manuscripts of any writers, be it Leo Tolstoy, William Faulkner, Oscar&nbsp;Wilde, Marcel Proust or anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As already mentioned, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Textograf</span><span class="font0"> is a web-based application and cannot be installed on a computer. Integration with other tools is possible only through the files that can be downloaded from the application.</span></p>
