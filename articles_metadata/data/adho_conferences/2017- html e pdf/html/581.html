<p><span class="font0">VIA is a mobile art project combining video-dance, computational music and architecture. Its main goal is&nbsp;to endow public locations of downtown Rio de Janeiro&nbsp;with video-dance and music, accessed through locative&nbsp;media (smartphones or tablets). The VIA website is the&nbsp;main way of learning about the project, as it provides&nbsp;all the necessary information, including a map that&nbsp;indicates the specific locations where users are able to&nbsp;access the multimedia pieces of the project. Two “Vias”,&nbsp;or routes, can be selected on the map, “Via 1” or “Via&nbsp;2”. Each of them is a distinct route on the map linking&nbsp;specific locations according to landscape features (as&nbsp;we shall explain in the next section). Although the&nbsp;project suggests experiencing the work according to&nbsp;these two routes, each viewer can decide how and&nbsp;when they are going to do so. There is not only one&nbsp;precise route to experience the project: some may&nbsp;decide to access the content in a single location and&nbsp;then leave, whereas others might want to visit all the&nbsp;locations creating their own routes from one point to&nbsp;another. Besides the website, the public can also learn&nbsp;about the project through printed maps distributed in&nbsp;Rio de Janeiro’s downtown areas where VIA is located.&nbsp;The distributed maps are the same as the website’s,&nbsp;except for the fact that there is not a distinction&nbsp;between Vias 1 and 2. It also includes the addresses of&nbsp;the locations in order to guide viewers through the&nbsp;project. The main technology employed to access the&nbsp;project is the QR Code. QR Code is a specific twodimensional barcode target that can be read by&nbsp;barcode readers and phone cameras. Once viewers&nbsp;decide on a location to start, they must walk to it,&nbsp;where they will find QR Codes on walls, utility poles,&nbsp;litter bins and others. With a QR code reader&nbsp;application, they must frame the QR barcode and wait&nbsp;for the content to be loaded. Summarily, any user&nbsp;equipped with a tablet or smartphone with an Internet&nbsp;connection has free access to experimental&nbsp;multimedia pieces of video-dance and music while&nbsp;moving through specific points of Rio de Janeiro. The&nbsp;multimedia content resulted from the collaboration&nbsp;between Joao Queiroz (artistic director), Daniella&nbsp;Aguiar (dancer and choreographer), Luiz E. Casteloes&nbsp;(music composer), Adriano Mattos Correa (architect),&nbsp;Guilherme Landin and Claudia Rangel (video-makers),&nbsp;and Alfredo Suppia (video editor). Each multimedia&nbsp;product was the result of artistic investigation taking&nbsp;place between dance, music, and the architectural&nbsp;richness of Rio de Janeiro urban space, providing&nbsp;pedestrians with an experience that superposes&nbsp;“navigation” through the city and contemporary dance&nbsp;and music. The sounds/music accompanying these&nbsp;videos derive from CAC (Computer-Assisted&nbsp;Composition), CGA (Computer-Generated Assistance),&nbsp;and Sonification - related approaches. They consist of&nbsp;image-to-sound conversions using patches developed&nbsp;in OpenMusic. These conversions employ, as input&nbsp;images, a collection of photographs previously taken&nbsp;from the locations where the dancing took place. The&nbsp;compositional action involved consists mainly of&nbsp;normalizing the xy axis data extracted from the&nbsp;contours of these images within audible ranges. There&nbsp;has been no further compositional manipulation of the&nbsp;input data - such as displacement, editing, looping, etc.&nbsp;Two types of location were chosen to create the “vias”.&nbsp;In the first type, the chosen locations, although varying&nbsp;from open spaces, as squares, to narrow streets, share&nbsp;the property of being places with ongoing movement&nbsp;of people. The second type is characterized by building&nbsp;interspaces, independent of other architectural&nbsp;characteristics. The dance movements were developed&nbsp;in strict relation to the chosen spots. In this way, the&nbsp;dance is created in relation both to the buildings and&nbsp;to the passing people. The audio-visual language is&nbsp;based on discontinuous approaches and withdrawals&nbsp;from the “theme” (performer), which irregularly&nbsp;repeats short, alternated and cyclic movements. The&nbsp;video editing is rigorously metric and based on the&nbsp;organization of parts in regularly juxtaposed&nbsp;sequences. This method fixates and highlights&nbsp;invariant properties of the landscape algorithmically&nbsp;translated by the music. One of the project’s main&nbsp;features is that viewers can access the pieces at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">exact same location where the video and the music were created. As a result, mobile technology users&nbsp;connected to the Internet are able to access the&nbsp;multimedia pieces of the project, experiencing&nbsp;environments in which information and virtual objects&nbsp;“overlap” physical reality.</span></p>
