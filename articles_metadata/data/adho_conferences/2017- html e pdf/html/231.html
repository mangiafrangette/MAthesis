<p><span class="font3">This paper provides a brief overview of library best practices for digital curation, with particular attention&nbsp;to the areas that highlight disciplinary tensions&nbsp;between library science and the humanities. The&nbsp;authors introduce the University of Victoria’s grant&nbsp;service “menu” for digital preservation and hosting&nbsp;services, and outline some of the most promising&nbsp;models for balancing creativity with sustainability in&nbsp;DH project design. We will suggest roles for libraries,&nbsp;researchers, administrators, and funders in helping to&nbsp;create technical and social conditions that nurture&nbsp;sustainable research projects in the digital humanities&nbsp;and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowledge building is an iterative process that refines and extends previous research. Through&nbsp;citation, we acknowledge our debt to scholars and&nbsp;theorists whose work enables our own. The&nbsp;ephemeral nature of the digital world threatens to&nbsp;destabilize a centuries long system of scholarly&nbsp;communication and knowledge sharing. In a print&nbsp;ecosystem many immutable copies of an object are&nbsp;distributed globally and are curated by network of&nbsp;organizations. In the digital world a single copy of an&nbsp;object is served from a central location. Digital content&nbsp;is thus susceptible to manipulation, corruption, and&nbsp;erasure. The key to analog preservation is to ensure&nbsp;that artefacts remain the same. Digital preservation, in&nbsp;contrast, requires “active management” comprising&nbsp;constant changes, patches, and updates. Objects&nbsp;become quickly obsolete as the environments around&nbsp;them change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Funding agencies are putting increased pressure on researchers to include sustainability plans in&nbsp;funding applications (NEH 2016, SSHRC 2016).&nbsp;Researchers often turn to the University Library to&nbsp;provide preservation solutions for digital projects&nbsp;without fully understanding the technical, policy, and&nbsp;funding implications of these requests. Libraries have&nbsp;made significant strides in planning for the long-term&nbsp;preservation of the many thousands of digital objects&nbsp;in our collections. Digitization projects adhere to strict&nbsp;standards for resolution, colour management, and file&nbsp;formats (FADGI 2016). Digital asset management&nbsp;systems like Hydra/Fedora provide a single place to&nbsp;store objects along with descriptive and&nbsp;administrative metadata that helps to determine the&nbsp;preservation actions that should be taken against each&nbsp;object (Goddard, 2016). Those actions include&nbsp;auditing and bit-checking of file systems to ensure&nbsp;against data loss, format migrations as media and file&nbsp;types become obsolete, replication of objects across&nbsp;different technology stacks and jurisdictions, and&nbsp;discovery interfaces that ensure continued&nbsp;discoverability and access. Libraries are building&nbsp;national networks that will allow us to replicate data&nbsp;across multiple jurisdictions to mitigate against&nbsp;disasters both natural and human (DPN 2016,&nbsp;Canadiana 2016, CARL 2016). Despite concerted&nbsp;efforts, only a handful of library repositories have so&nbsp;far met the stringent conditions that are necessary for&nbsp;certification as a Trusted Digital Repository, which&nbsp;requires technical and policy elements including plans&nbsp;for long term staffing and funding, and contingency&nbsp;plans in the event of organizational failure (CRL,&nbsp;2015). Ultimately, libraries still can’t make guarantees&nbsp;about preservation for digital objects in our own&nbsp;collections, even those that are subject to&nbsp;internationally recognized best practices. This&nbsp;problem is compounded when DH research projects&nbsp;fail to adhere to adequate quality standards for objects&nbsp;(e.g. images, texts, video, maps, mark-up) and overlook&nbsp;established metadata models and vocabularies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To this point we have outlined the challenges of curating fairly static digital files, but most DH projects&nbsp;are far more than the sum of their digital objects. Many&nbsp;DH research projects are complex software stacks&nbsp;with many layers of tools, objects, code and&nbsp;dependencies. If a project is built on Drupal, for&nbsp;example, librarians will have to not only maintain all&nbsp;of the unique objects and code produced by the&nbsp;project, but they are also committed to maintaining a&nbsp;specific version of a rapidly evolving software&nbsp;platform -- a version that will likely be obsolete before&nbsp;the project concludes. Drupal is, at the very least, well&nbsp;documented and widely deployed. Many DH projects&nbsp;also include custom-built tools, the inner workings of&nbsp;which are known only to a handful of people on the&nbsp;research team. The complex technology profiles of&nbsp;contemporary DH projects require ongoing active&nbsp;management including patching, tending, and&nbsp;rebuilding over time (Burpee, 2015). While the library&nbsp;may have sufficient resources to steward one or two&nbsp;unique project environments, this approach cannot&nbsp;scale to hundreds or even thousands of projects over&nbsp;time. In the current technical and funding&nbsp;environment is simply not possible for libraries to&nbsp;provide high-level curation for the enormous variety&nbsp;of funded digital projects that are produced by&nbsp;researchers within their organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Libraries alone will not solve the problem of sustainability in DH projects. A fundamental&nbsp;characteristic of sustainability is that it must be&nbsp;established as a key design principle from the outset.&nbsp;It is almost impossible to retroactively render a&nbsp;project sustainable without rebuilding from the&nbsp;ground up. Initial choices about technologies, data&nbsp;models, formats, and documentation will influence the&nbsp;likelihood that a project will still be accessible in a&nbsp;decade. One complicating factor is that sustainability&nbsp;is largely at odds with a researcher’s freedom of choice&nbsp;when it comes to decisions about platforms, tools, and&nbsp;data models. Truly sustainable DH projects will&nbsp;require a level of standardization that is far from the&nbsp;current norm in DH project development, and which is&nbsp;unlikely to be unequivocally embraced by humanists.&nbsp;Research is an experimental process, and&nbsp;technological constraints can stifle creativity and&nbsp;independence of action. Models, by their very nature,&nbsp;seek to simplify, while the humanist tradition revels in&nbsp;nuance and complexity (McCarty, 2005; Quamen,&nbsp;2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Leslie Johnston from the Library of Congress suggests that libraries can pursue two models for&nbsp;preserving complex DH projects. The first approach is&nbsp;to “preserve the content but forgo the look and feel.&nbsp;This is often extremely unpopular.” The second is to&nbsp;“preserve the content and the look and feel exactly as&nbsp;they were implemented. This is often close to&nbsp;impossible.” (Johnson, 2013) The tension between&nbsp;these two models is where libraries, researchers, and&nbsp;funders need to more clearly outline our assumptions&nbsp;and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The University of Victoria Libraries have developed a suite of preservation services for grant funded&nbsp;projects in order to plainly articulate our&nbsp;competencies, assets, and constraints (Goddard and&nbsp;Walde, 2017). This document acts as kind of a “menu”&nbsp;of services from which researchers can select as they&nbsp;develop their grant applications. These include the use&nbsp;of our Hydra/Fedora4 digital asset management&nbsp;system, metadata expertise that extends to&nbsp;consultations around interoperability and linked data,&nbsp;web hosting and discovery, exhibit building software,&nbsp;copyright consultation, open access publishing,&nbsp;research data management, and digitization services.&nbsp;We provide template paragraphs related to&nbsp;sustainability, preservation, open access, and&nbsp;knowledge mobilization that researchers can easily&nbsp;repurpose for any given funding proposal. We include&nbsp;a break down of the in-kind value of each of these&nbsp;services, along with any costs that will be charged&nbsp;back, so that researchers can easily estimate the value&nbsp;of the institutional commitment. We hope that this&nbsp;approach will enable critical conversations about&nbsp;sustainability to happen during the grant writing&nbsp;process, rather than towards the end of funding cycles&nbsp;as has been too often the case in the past. In order to&nbsp;offer our “gold standard” preservation services&nbsp;libraries will have to be involved in early&nbsp;conversations about technology preferences and data&nbsp;models. We certainly don’t assume that all decisions&nbsp;will be dictated by curation needs, but rather that our&nbsp;consultation will enable researchers to make cleareyed decisions about the impact of their choices on&nbsp;sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The preservation “menu” is an appealing model for researchers, as it enables them to quickly understand&nbsp;the variety of services and in-kind contributions that&nbsp;the library can offer in order to strengthen a funding&nbsp;application. There are also advantages to the library.&nbsp;By tying preservation services to grant funded&nbsp;projects we can avail of a rigorous review process that&nbsp;helps us to direct library resources towards research&nbsp;that has been deemed valuable by a network of&nbsp;disciplinary experts. It provides an easy formula for&nbsp;calculating in-kind contributions for letters of support,&nbsp;and to some extent standardizes the process of writing&nbsp;those letters. It helps to promote librarians as&nbsp;desirable co-applicants and collaborators on funding&nbsp;applications. It underscores to administrators the&nbsp;library’s value as a university research support. This&nbsp;model also provides mechanisms whereby grant funds&nbsp;can flow back into the development of new features for&nbsp;the library’s digital asset management and publishing&nbsp;platforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Susan Brown notes that “successful technologies rely on social resources.” (Brown, 2016) Part of our&nbsp;challenge is to muster support from researchers,&nbsp;librarians, administrators, and funders to create&nbsp;optimal conditions for long-term digital curation. The&nbsp;conversation about long-term preservation will be an&nbsp;ongoing negotiation that bridges different disciplinary&nbsp;perspectives, and balances ideals with resource&nbsp;constraints. Just as the traditional model of scholarly&nbsp;print publishing has shaped the means of scholarly&nbsp;production through the last two centuries, these&nbsp;conversations will ultimately will help to shape the&nbsp;future of humanities research platforms, resources,&nbsp;and methodologies.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
