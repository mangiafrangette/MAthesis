<p><span class="font1">Digital information practitioners across many areas seek to preserve and provide access to the voices&nbsp;of disenfranchised and marginalized communities.&nbsp;However, the curation of cultural objects often comes&nbsp;with colonial implications and power-based&nbsp;hierarchical differentials. Providing access to the&nbsp;collections of these groups requires genuine,&nbsp;responsive cooperation, and it also requires that the&nbsp;technical and information systems through which we&nbsp;engage community contributors and participants be&nbsp;equally responsive to diverse cultural circumstances&nbsp;and needs. With support from an IMLS National&nbsp;Forums grant, the Northeastern University Digital&nbsp;Scholarship Group seeks to facilitate a national&nbsp;conversation from which we can learn about&nbsp;responsible partnership in digital projects involving&nbsp;such community-driven collections. We will host a&nbsp;series of public and working meetings to produce a&nbsp;teaching and learning toolkit, to prompt education and&nbsp;change in the approach to systems design for diverse&nbsp;and culturally-sensitive materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The need for community-driven pedagogy in this area is well recognized. Practitioners in many fields&nbsp;seek genuine, responsive partnership with the&nbsp;communities in which cultural artifacts were created&nbsp;(See, for example, the repatriation policies of the&nbsp;United States’ National Museum of the American&nbsp;Indian or Johnston on recent discussions of&nbsp;repatriation prompted by new publications in the&nbsp;museum field.), deeper understanding of the&nbsp;hegemonic role of knowledge representation via&nbsp;standardized ontological decisions (Berman 1971,&nbsp;Olson 2002.), and investigation into the role of&nbsp;algorithm, interface, and tool design in reinforcing&nbsp;power differentials inherent in the status quo&nbsp;(McPherson 2012, Sweeney 2013, Chun 2011) These&nbsp;topics also arise in venues such as journal special&nbsp;issues (see, for example: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code4Lib Special Issue on&nbsp;Diversity in Library Technology,</span><span class="font1"> 2015; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archival Science&nbsp;Special Issue: Keeping Cultures Alive: Archives and&nbsp;Indigenous Human Rights,</span><span class="font1"> 2012; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Library Quarterly&nbsp;Special Issue on Diversity and Library and Information&nbsp;Science Education,</span><span class="font1"> 2013), conference presentations&nbsp;and keynotes (Noble 2015, Matienzo 2015, Cole 2015)&nbsp;such as held by the Society of American Archivists, and&nbsp;current CFPs, such as those of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digital Humanities&nbsp;Quarterly, Archives,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ALISE.</span><span class="font1"> New interdisciplinary&nbsp;projects focus on building new methods and tools for&nbsp;archiving media content as a corrective to past&nbsp;silences in the archive (Documenting the Now, Social&nbsp;Media Archives Toolkit, Documenting Ferguson, Our&nbsp;Marathon, to name a few). This work suggests more&nbsp;challenging questions: What ethical decisions inform&nbsp;the dissemination of digital collections? How are&nbsp;naming and representation in our information&nbsp;systems influenced by power? When tools and&nbsp;interfaces guide interactions with documents and&nbsp;items, are those interfaces responsive to community&nbsp;needs, or do they force a diversity of ideas into ill-fitting boxes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To engage with these issues and inform the toolkit we plan two forum events at which we seek to gather&nbsp;a diversity of perspectives and input on the questions&nbsp;above. The first forum will be held in October 2017,&nbsp;and our preparation for that event will involve a&nbsp;detailed scan of existing LIS and museum pedagogy in&nbsp;the areas central to our focus, and an examination of&nbsp;existing project methodologies and processes. We will&nbsp;also develop a set of design provocations, discussion&nbsp;questions, and a reading list. The poster will present&nbsp;the results of the environmental scan, the design&nbsp;prompts, reading list, and discussion questions for the&nbsp;opening forum, and the preliminary design ideas for&nbsp;the toolkit for critique and commentary by DH2017&nbsp;conference participants. Our goal for the project is to&nbsp;involve diverse community input at every stage of the&nbsp;design, and this poster represents the first step in that&nbsp;process.</span></p>
