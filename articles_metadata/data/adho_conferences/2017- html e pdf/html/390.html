<p><span class="font6">Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Modelling Literary Scholarship</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The availability of digitised full-text resources, as well as bibliographical data in standard database&nbsp;format, has recently opened a new chapter in the&nbsp;sociology of literature by revaluating empirical&nbsp;approaches and data-driven scholarship. The road to&nbsp;this “empirical turn” in literary scholarship has been&nbsp;paved by such scholars as Franco Moretti (2005, 2013)&nbsp;and Matthew Jockers (2013), who showed how&nbsp;empirical data like bibliographical records,&nbsp;annotations, title words, genre categorization, etc.,&nbsp;may help in generating new knowledge about literary&nbsp;periods. This approach gathered its momentum as&nbsp;other works exploring the possibility of using such&nbsp;data to answer particular research questions emerged.&nbsp;Due to the shortage of space we will name just a few&nbsp;that have the most influence on this paper, dividing&nbsp;them into three research strands. Firstly, the use of&nbsp;bibliographical data for statistical inferences on&nbsp;literary processes, e.g Bode’s (2012) rereading of&nbsp;Australian literary history through the data from&nbsp;AustLit (Australian Literary Bibliography). Secondly,&nbsp;the study of author co-occurrences and mutual&nbsp;references, e.g. visualising literary circles on the basis&nbsp;of such data by Long and So (2013a, 2013b). Thirdly,&nbsp;the application of topic modelling to uncover pertinent&nbsp;issues in literary scholarship, e.g. Goldstone and&nbsp;Underwood’s analyses of the evolution of American&nbsp;literary scholarship on the example of PMLA (2012)&nbsp;and seven major literary journals (2014). In&nbsp;combining those approaches into a macroanalytical&nbsp;study of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teksty Drugie,</span><span class="font6"> we also adopted the rationale&nbsp;introduced by the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">40th anniversary internet edition</span><span class="font6"> of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Signs,</span><span class="font6"> a literary journal dedicated to feminist criticism.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Aim</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The aim of this study is to apply macroanalytical methods to trace the chronology of transformations of&nbsp;Polish literary studies using the example of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teksty&nbsp;Drugie.</span><span class="font6"> We hypothesise that the collection of papers&nbsp;published in a leading academic journal on literary&nbsp;scholarship can serve as a reliable approximation to&nbsp;chronological changes and/or breaks in Polish literary&nbsp;theory at the turn of the 20th century. We will first&nbsp;trace the topics present in the journal and then analyse&nbsp;them in diachronic perspective. We will focus on the&nbsp;influence of extra-textual events and phenomena on&nbsp;literary scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We believe that 25 years is a sufficient timespan to observe linguistic differences which are not caused by&nbsp;regular language change. Other projects conducted by&nbsp;the authors of this paper show that a language change&nbsp;(in Polish) typically spans many decades rather than a&nbsp;mere 25 years (e.g. Eder &amp; Górski, 2016).&nbsp;Furthermore, we deal with conventionalised language&nbsp;of scholarship, so the use of certain terms often relates&nbsp;to a given paradigm rather than to a language in&nbsp;general. Nevertheless, we are aware of possible&nbsp;changes of meaning of keywords while interpreting&nbsp;topic models.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Material</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teksty Drugie</span><span class="font6"> is a Polish literary journal dedicated to literary scholarship. It has been published since&nbsp;1990 by the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish&nbsp;Academy of Sciences. It focuses on literary theory,&nbsp;criticism and cultural studies, while also publishing&nbsp;articles by authors from neighbouring disciplines&nbsp;(philosophy, sociology, anthropology). The journal&nbsp;publishes monographic issues dedicated to particular&nbsp;topics or approaches within literary and cultural&nbsp;studies. All those features make it a good example for&nbsp;exploring the vicissitudes of Polish literary&nbsp;scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The corpus consists of the entire collection of papers published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teksty Drugie</span><span class="font6"> (excluding letters,&nbsp;surveys, notes, etc.) in the years 1990-2014 (2,553&nbsp;texts, 11,310,638 words). The material covering the&nbsp;years 1990-1998 was digitised, OCR-ed, and then&nbsp;manually edited, in order to exclude running heads,&nbsp;editorial comments, and so forth. Obviously, some&nbsp;textual noise - e.g. a certain number of misspelled&nbsp;characters - could not be neutralised. The material&nbsp;from 1999 onwards was digitally-born, but even&nbsp;though a small number of textual issues might have&nbsp;occurred. We believe, however, that distant reading&nbsp;techniques are resistant to small amounts of&nbsp;systematic noise (Eder, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Given the nature of Polish, which is highly inflected, lemmatization was necessary for a reliable processing&nbsp;of texts. The corpus has been lemmatised with LEM&nbsp;1.0. (Literary Exploration Machine) developed by&nbsp;CLARIN-PL (see: Piasecki, Walkowiak, Maryl 2017).&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To scrutinise the formulated hypothesis, we applied one of the methods of information retrieval&nbsp;that recently attracts a good share of attention in&nbsp;Digital Humanities circles, namely topic modelling in&nbsp;its classical variant known as Latent Dirichlet&nbsp;Allocation (LDA). The method, introduced by Blei&nbsp;(2012), allows for finding co-occurring cohorts of&nbsp;words that presumably reveal (latent) semantic&nbsp;relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The experiments were performed using a tailored script in the R programming language, supplemented&nbsp;by the package ‘stylo’ (Eder et al., 2016) for text preprocessing, and the package ‘mallet’ (McCallum, 2002)&nbsp;for the actual LDA analysis. A bimodal network of the&nbsp;relations between topics were produced using the&nbsp;software Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Topic modelling relies on the assumption that particular topics are defined by words co-appearing in&nbsp;a given context. Hence, the definition of “context” is&nbsp;crucial to allow for any reliable observations. A few&nbsp;different solutions have been suggested (e.g. Blei,&nbsp;2012; Jockers, 2013). In our approach, we did not split&nbsp;input texts into smaller samples, which was motivated&nbsp;by the fact that the vast majority of the studies&nbsp;published in Teksty Drugie are rather short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other parameters used in the study included: a stop word list containing 327 words (mostly function&nbsp;words, numerals, and very common adverbs), 100&nbsp;topics extracted in 1,000 iterations, with the obvious&nbsp;caveat that this choice was arbitrary.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A general overview of the obtained results shows a few interesting patterns. Firstly, we analysed and&nbsp;categorised the topics on the basis of their&nbsp;predominant words. The categories are as follows:&nbsp;literary theory (e.g. literature, fiction, text), poetics&nbsp;(e.g. verse, novel, short story, rhetoric) and&nbsp;methodological approaches (e.g. deconstruction,&nbsp;comparative literature, postcolonial studies,&nbsp;psychoanalysis); history of literature (e.g.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">romanticism, contemporary poets) and cross-cutting research themes (e.g. death, politics, literacy).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A thorough exploration of such models requires a topographical visualisation capable of showing the&nbsp;connections between various topics, which often share&nbsp;a key word (cf. Goldstone and Underwood, 2012). The&nbsp;network (Fig. 1) is too large to be adequately rendered&nbsp;in this paper (a </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">higher resolution image of Figure 1</span><span class="font6"> is&nbsp;available online), yet even without the knowledge&nbsp;about concrete topics presented, we may see (partly&nbsp;thanks to ForceAtlas2 layout, which highlighted this&nbsp;feature) that groups of topics in our corpus are&nbsp;concentrically distributed. This onion-like distribution&nbsp;allows us to distinguish between the central topics (i.e.&nbsp;those who appear in many different papers) and those&nbsp;who appear less often or sporadically and hence are&nbsp;not particularly well-connected with other topics. For&nbsp;instance, in the geometrical centre of the network we&nbsp;may find topics and words pertinent to literary&nbsp;scholarship:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;literature, literary, comparative</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">literature, national literatures, Jewish studies, fiction, together with some names of contemporary authors.&nbsp;Outliers are also interesting, and could be assigned to&nbsp;3 groups: (1) expressions in foreign languages, (2)&nbsp;particular research topics or discourses which&nbsp;introduce quite a hermetic language, not shared in&nbsp;other topics, (3) noise (e.g. word bits generated&nbsp;through some errors in OCR).</span></p><img src="390_files/390-1.jpg" style="width:204pt;height:195pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. Relationships between topics in Teksty Drugie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet it has to be noted that even the most accurate rendering of the topical distribution is still only a static&nbsp;snapshot insensitive to changes. In order to see the&nbsp;evolution of topics, we need to visualise them on a&nbsp;temporal axis. Due to a shortage of space we present&nbsp;here only a few examples, to show the application of&nbsp;our method. All dot plots are presented below with a&nbsp;trend line based on two period moving average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fig. 2 represents the gradual shift of interest from more literature-oriented approaches, to the cultural&nbsp;ones. Both red (topic 19: literature, literary, writer,&nbsp;work) and green (topic 5: literature, research, theory)&nbsp;seem to be dominating until approx. 2007, when the&nbsp;blue line (topic 49: culture, cultural, social) overtakes&nbsp;the green line for the first time. Three years later it&nbsp;becomes the dominant approach, marking the shift in&nbsp;the overall content of Teksty Drugie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Literature vs. culture</span></p><img src="390_files/390-2.jpg" style="width:203pt;height:117pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">° Culture, cultural, social ° Literature, literary, writer ° Literary research, theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 2. A temporal distribution of three topics related to literature and culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Topic analysis allows us to not only trace the evolution of the journal itself but also to see how the&nbsp;real-world events shape the topics undertaken by&nbsp;literary scholars. Fig. 3 shows the influence of the&nbsp;political transformation in Poland on the content of&nbsp;Teksty Drugie. We see a similar pattern in trends of all&nbsp;topics presented: grey (topic 60: power, society, state,&nbsp;fight, war, law), red (topic 36: political, communism,&nbsp;Polish People’s Republic), blue (topic 7: Polish, Pole,&nbsp;national), yellow (topic 94: censorship, exile, novel,&nbsp;positivism, country, London, political). All of them are&nbsp;quite important in the early 1990s and the interest&nbsp;gradually fades until the end of this decade. The spikes&nbsp;around 2001/2002 are caused by the publication of&nbsp;monographic issues which make certain topic more&nbsp;dominant. E.g. Issue No.1-2/2000 was dedicated to&nbsp;socialist realism hence the spike of “communism-related” issue in that year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This trend shows how political events (namely the transformation and forming of the new democracy)&nbsp;are dominating even the literary scholarship. It could&nbsp;be also the case that more politically charged issues&nbsp;(e.g. history of censorship in Poland) could have been&nbsp;published only after the fall of the communism, hence&nbsp;so many articles in that period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">_o censorship, exile, novel, positivism, country, London, political</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 3. Temporal shift of topics related to politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last trend we would like to discuss is the emergence of the Holocaust studies in Teksty Drugie.&nbsp;As we can see in the Fig. 4, the red trend line (topic 59:&nbsp;Jew, Jewish, antisemitic) is visible on the fairly same&nbsp;level all through the 25 years, whereas the blue one&nbsp;(topic 18: testimony, Holocaust) is virtually nonexistent until 2001.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 4. Temporal distribution of topics related to Jewish studies and the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This sudden boom can be linked to the publishing of the Polish edition of Neighbors by Jan Gross (2000)&nbsp;and the investigation into the role of Polish civilians in&nbsp;the genocide perpetrated in the city of Jedwabne&nbsp;during the World War II. This case opened a long&nbsp;process of re-investigating the troubled Polish-Jewish&nbsp;past, which could be traced also in the issues of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teksty&nbsp;Drugie.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In this study we tried to show how extra-textual events influence the content of literary scholarship on&nbsp;the example of Holocaust studies and political&nbsp;transformation, which entailed the prevalence of&nbsp;topics related to politics, power, society, state, and&nbsp;communism in the early 1990s. In the subsequent&nbsp;studies we plan to compare the results of topic&nbsp;modelling with bibliographical data in order to check&nbsp;whether the dominance of a certain topic stems from&nbsp;the large number of scholars who pursue it, or if it&nbsp;instead depends on the fact that a small group of&nbsp;authors published more often than others.&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgement</span></p>
