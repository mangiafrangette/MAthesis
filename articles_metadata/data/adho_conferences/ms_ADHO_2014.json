        "abstract": "This short paper will present a work in progress pertaining to the applicability of Derrida's theory of the archive to emerging forms of archive, such as multiply curated digital archive like Facebook. Preliminary findings are grounded in a pilot study consisting of empirical research conducted with four participants. Additional interviews will be conducted in the early months of 2014. Findings from these interviews will be included in my proposed short paper at DH2014. In addition to presenting the aforementioned empirical research, this proposed short paper will also describe an interactive exhibit called FeverBook, which is being designed through both iterative design and participatory design processes. The FeverBook exhibit is intended to afford users the ability to experience firsthand the effects of such Derridian notions as 'violence,' 'spectrality,' and 'troubling' as they pertain to a fictive Facebook account.",

We provide an analysis to challenge the artificial division of castes presented in these paintings by providing insights into the underlying aspects of mestizaje such labor division. Our study identifies the paradox between the intent of the paintings to reaffirm the Spanish prominence in the Americas and the implicit anticipation of the demise of Spanish colonial rule.",

This evaluation covers a survey of eleven cases which specifically relate to urban and spatial issues (OpenPlans, Nextdoor, CitySourced, Neighborland, LocalWiki, Spacehive, MindMixer,LocalData, mySociety, Ideavibes, Community Planit ). By this way, we aim to provide an insight into the inclusion strategies and tools employed for Geoweb 2.0-supported citizen involvement.   As a result, we observed that the aforementioned organizations view higher levels of design empowerment as secondary priorities. According to the survey participants, their focus was on data collection and providing information rather than active citizen empowerment in collaborative urban design processes.",

That is, in this Canadian medium where editorial oversight on orthographic convention is minimal, color prefers different contexts than colour to the extent that we can predict the variant given its surrounding words with surprising accuracy. While this would seem to critique language external motivations for variant selection -- specifically the orthography/identity connection advocated by Heffernan et al. (2010) who argue for a connection between ideology and orthography in the Canadian context -- these contexts are themselves ideologically motivated as they tend to take the form of differentially oriented advertisements, or, as I term them, 'solicitations'. Combining computational with more traditional sociolinguistic techniques, this paper proposes the identity/orthography connection in more proximal, more interactional terms.",

We describe a series of experiments conducted on a collection of approximately 35,000 Danish folklore records and explain our primary findings: 1) that computational cross-validation of traditional human indexes is effective at uncovering \"liminal\" stories that are mislabeled and overlooked in the original classification scheme but prove to be of great interest to present-day scholars; and 2) that automatically propagating multiple labeled topics from a modern research-oriented index across a large folklore collection performs best when combined with expert human feedback.",

In deploying topic modeling as a discourse analysis tool, we aim to highlight the unique discursive makeup of encyclopaedic articles, treating them as a combination of various discourses independent of their original disciplinary classification. Some of these discourses might have been lost to the modern reader through the classification process itself, and others may prove useful in uncovering interdisciplinary connections between classes that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. This approach can then be used to identify similar 'philosophic' or Enlightenment discourses underpinning a wide variety of contemporary 18th-century texts.",

The framework is based on various methods and techniques employed in the field of graphonomics. It is grounded on the principles of handwriting production and handwriting analysis. We explore various features used in the related area of gesture design and recognition and their application to the analysis of scripts. The computed quantitative features could serve as descriptors for scripts, and  be used for comparing and analyzing scripts. This is especially applicable to the field of paleography, where such quantitative features are much needed. We also present a prototype implementation of the proposed framework.",

Paper remains the principal scholarly format accepted in many circles and in spite of all activities on long-term digital archiving, it remains a central medium to disseminate and conserve patrimonial content over the decades and centuries.

Efforts to increase the documentation of these small languages have led to the development of tools and repositories over the past decade. However, not all digital language archives currently provide metadata to the Open Language Archives Community, rendering their collections invisible to their aggregated search. While repository webpages may be accessible to web-searches, they do not allow the targeted search by language that is the focus of OLAC’s aggregator. Other repositories (including many institutional repositories—national libraries and archives, mission archives and so on) have language content that is not noted in the collection’s catalog, Finally, there are collections still held by their creators and not in a repository at all. In this paper I present the results of a survey trying to locate such collections and identify features that could make more information more freely available, and suggest that it is a DH project to create repositories.",

However, as documented elsewhere, challenges stemming from geographical distance must be managed to ensure that teams are work together successfully. One of the primary challenges is finding ways to facilitate communication and coordination across distance and time. Skype and other internet-enabled tools provide some potential to accomplish this; however, little knowledge exists on the best way to use these tools within a geographically dispersed collaboration. This paper will contribute to this discussion with an examination of the experiences of a DH lab using an open communication channel through Skype to connect team members located in different sites.",

The central research question is how a digital genetic and semantically enriched edition can support the appreciation of an artist’s concepts and associations during the process of a work’s creation.  Therefore, prominent issues are (1) identifying the need for editions of (hand)written sources in art historical research, (2) addressing the difficulties in encoding the origination process of an edition and the application of the TEI recommendations for genetic edition to resolve them, and (3) using semantic annotation of concepts to track influences and association processes of the artist in order to facilitate the interpretation and comprehension of his work.",

        "abstract": "Ontologies are widely employed as formal shared vocabularies for many domains of knowledge. However, for some domains there is a variety of ontologies instead of one standard vocabulary. These ontologies are typically quite semantically diverse since they were constructed by different experts who possess contrary viewpoints on the domain. Reaching consensus and maximizing the agreement between the diverse ontologies constitutes a big research challenge, especially for controversial domains, such as cultural heritage. The goal of this research is to explore ways for maximizing inter-ontology agreement. We proposed a collaborative scheme for user evaluation of ontological relations. Our experimental results, based on the devised local and global agree-ment measures, show that collaborative evaluation can significantly improve the agreement between ontologies. Furthermore, despite the diversity of viewpoints, based on these evaluation scores most of the consensual truthful relations can be revealed and unified into one standard vocabulary.",

The data collected was used to carry out network and central tendencies analyses, and further used to build an interactive map visualization using the DARIAH-DE Geo-Browser. We have been able to identify key patterns characterizing this community. In terms of disciplines, two stand out: the central location of Literary Studies as a meeting point, and the extended influence of Information Science and History joining together most of the other fields included. Additionally, we provide insights into patterns of collaboration and shared approaches distinctive of this community. Furthermore, the extended - and almost strategic - geographic distribution of the survey's participants suggests that thanks to the ties with other DH communities (Anglo-American, and Continental-European), Spanish and Portuguese speaking DHers have the potential to bridge and incorporate distinct practices and approaches.  Other insights regarding the historical development, collaboration practices, and work locations are also dealt with in the long version of this paper.",

The Willa Cather Archive. U of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2004-2013. Web.). Largely regarded as a private person, Cather forbade the publication of her correspondences; only within the past year have her letters finally been published. With the publication of these letter comes the unique opportunity for scholars to research Cather’s personal thoughts and voice. Our research focused on using stylometrics to explore the ways in which the voice Cather used in her correspondences differs from the voice she used in her public writing; our conclusions point to similarities between Cather’s novel My Mortal Enemy, a work noted for both its economy of style and autobiographical features, and her recently published letters.",

Our aim was to understand how different digital devices and physical, printed publications are used, and integrated into reader behaviour. It took place at a time of rapid change in the technology of reading in digital environments: the Kindle, iPad, and other tablet computers were launched, and quickly became popular, during the period of the study. We might hypothesise, therefore, that such a period would usher in the transformation of the reading experience, and wholesale move from paper to digital devices and ebooks which had been predicted in the literature. Our study of reading behaviour provides evidence against which to test such claims.",

Unlike traditional 3D modeling software, which uses polygons to simulate form, procedural modeling entails the use of computer programming languages to write a semantic description of a building that then generates a polygonal model.  Procedural modeling has the potential to address a number of issues related to 3D archaeological reconstructions which are of concern to digital humanists. Of particular interest for archaeologists and architectural historians is the ability to test hypothetical reconstructions of ancient architecture in a fully realized urban context. The procedural rules link each iteration of a model to its source material, allowing the degree of certainty present in each model to be accurately defined through the documentation of each step in the process of interpreting a given data set. Procedural modeling thus enhances the scholarly value of architectural reconstructions by providing a platform for the comparison and refutation of 3D visualizations.",

The goal of the paper is to provide a much more exacting and thorough understanding of the complexity of data modeling required to support the argumentative nuance and conceptual subtlety of real-world, high-quality humanities research.",

Special attention is given to the semi-automatic data annotation, which involves mostly example-based machine learning approaches, trying to reduce the burden of a manual annotation, while producing still high quality data. Relying essentially on nothing more than a Debian desktop as web and database server and digital GPS-camera, the costs for the hard and software could be kept at an absolute minimum, allowing such a project to repeated even in economically disfavored regions of the world.",

The methodology allows us, to associate the following to a transcription or data extraction: the author of the process, the research project during which this operation was performed and the pipeline of methods that were used. This metaknowledge is crucial for aligning research data originating from different research groups, using different research approaches. These metadata are also important for the long-term evolution of projects, for which it is necessary to regularly revise data encoding strategies.",

Trois questions seront développées : d’une part, comment l’utilisation de la Text Encoding Initiative offre une solution adéquate pour traduire la souplesse d’un corpus constitué de textes prononcés à l’oral ? D’autre part, comment des dessins de nature différente (plans d’architecture, figures géométriques) placés dans leur contexte s’énoncent et constituent un discours argumenté ? Enfin, comment réussir grâce au numérique à générer une mise en abyme de normes et de règles juridiques constatée sur un temps long d’un siècle ? La méthode usitée devrait servir de modèle pour ce type de recherche sur la normalisation des disciplines qui, par définition, sont établies à partir de l’oralité avant d’être figées dans l’écrit.",

The grades obtained by this method are within an interval of 0.5 points of the professor’s grading in in about ¾ of the cases.

To get around a lack of technology and technical confidence in my students I had them use smartphones and an open-source Ruby On Rails engine for harvesting Instagram photos to create a modern archive of Shaw University student life, called #myshawu. I will talk about the archive and the technology, display some of the results and trends of exposing low technology users to a digital project, and delve into how DH is an tool for teaching them the skills and critical thinking necessary for true digital empowerment. I will also touch on how the project has grown to include alumni, what it has done for my students, and how this project connects with the larger DH community.",

The Sudan is a country rich in artefacts that go back to the dawn of history: archaeological remains, art, manuscripts that date back to beginning of Islam, books, archival documents, documentary film, hundreds of thousands of hours of video, television and radio, millions of photographs.  The National Archives alone hold 76 million photographic negatives.  This rich heritage is at risk.  At risk from the heat, dust and humidity, from obsolescence of media: the documentary film in the film archive, for instance, can only be accessed on ancient and deteriorating equipment, for which no spare parts for repair can be found.  These materials record history and culture of the country that is fast disappearing in the modern world.  If these artefacts themselves are lost, so too will be the knowledge of a way of life.  Digital Sudan will transform  Sudanese intellectual productions to modern electronic and digital media, which will be safer to preserve and easier to retrieve.",

We propose a new four-level word-class system for classical Chinese on the MeCab-based analyzer.

The second level is the ordinary word-class of classical Chinese, excluding “adjective.” The third and fourth levels are word-subclasses to describe detailed behavior of the words in classical Chinese texts. In order to make corpus for classical Chinese on MeCab, we have constructed a MeCab-corpus editor based on XEmacs CHISE.

In this long paper, we aim at analysing Tunisian representations of Europe through images, music and video clips. This is part of a broader research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, which engages undocumented mobility in the context of recent developments in Tunisia. Even after the events of the “Arab Spring” and its demands for dignity and liberty, the desire of young men (harragas) to “burn their papers” (harga), to leave their country of first citizenship and to reach Europe is still persistent. Such a desire to escape overall circumstances however cannot be reduced to merely economical motives. Undocumented mobility is by no means a one-dimensional, single-layered process governed by “push-and-pull factors”, but reflects the transnational social imaginaire and its various cultural resources as well.",

It does so by reference to the semantic space of English, following Lehrer’s statement that ‘the words of a language can be classified into sets which […] divide up the semantic space or the semantic domain in certain ways’. This space is described in this paper as the total accumulation of the various individual semantic fields which make up the language, as represented in the Historical Thesaurus' database. The paper therefore analyses the size of the English lexicon in these semantic clusters over time, including its metaphorical links, and aims to give a digital analysis of the history of English in ways which were previously not possible.",

More broadly, social media is transforming ways in which we perceive information, with its use becoming an increasingly important skill for researchers. This paper attempts to address issues of social media usage in digital archaeology through the case study of Lithuanian archaeology practices on Facebook. It provides an overview of Facebook use in archaeology by focusing on three core dimensions: users, content and communication, in attempt to understand the position of archaeological institutions and archaeologists, main types of shared archaeological content and criteria that enable successful communication  in social media.",

Exposing technical and theoretical decisions made while topic modeling 4,500 English language poems, this paper demonstrates how words such as “look” and “saw” remain influential and semantically present in document to topic distributions even when they have been removed during the data preparation process. Finally, it suggests that existing models of the poetic genre of ekphrasis, the verbal representation of visual representation, may be less dependent on poetic conventions once considered fundamental to the genre.",

From its years of encouraging digital cultural empowerment as a strategy to transform scholarly publishing, Southern Spaces offers a case study for examining the effectiveness of a project intent upon increasing participation in the creation, dissemination, and curation of humanities scholarship. Given the entrenched commercial clout of conventional scholarly publishing and the slow-to-change institutional structures for tenure and promotion that still resist digital humanities scholarship, how can we assess the significance of this project of digital cultural empowerment? And how do the years of experience publishing Southern Spaces contribute to an understanding of broader movements of cultural critique and social change?",

We will discuss challenges that have arisen from a model of organizing work around “fellowships” (a structure inherited and adapted from the “mainstream humanities”) and we will highlight the creation and formulation of an alternative model, the Digital Humanities Incubator, that prizes long-term enrichment by all actors involved in the production of digital humanities work.",

We have begun to experiment with distant reading strategies that provide views different from those offered by traditional critical opproaches. Such tools can begin to offer ways to assay and quantify some of the critical commonplaces that have grown up around Whitman’s masterwork. We have also been experimenting with a new way of visualizing textual phenomena and have created Indigo, an experimental XSLT-based tool to generate animated videos. Our experiment is in keeping with Whitman’s theories, in which “the reader . . . must himself or herself construct indeed the poem . . . .” In representing the literary work as an absorbing performance that comprises both \"data\" and \"art,\" our work is, in the terms of Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels, an act of “interpretive deformance.”",

A transatlantic collaboration formed around this task that builds on earlier work such as the methods taxonomy of Arts-Humanities.net, its adaptation within the DARIAH project and the ad-hoc list of categories used by DiRT. We opened a draft version of the taxonomy for the public to comment on in September 2013 that received a huge amount of feedback from people around the globe and across the disciplines. This vivid discussion shows the relevance of this task that has been around the Digital Humanities ever since John Unsworth introduced his concept of 'scholarly primitives' in 2000. With this paper, we hope to continue that discussion. In three different scenarios that are based on the shared taxonomy, we present how it works to serve task and user-oriented endeavors.",

I then position their rhetoric and ideology within the larger discourses of self-help, positive psychology, and utopian studies, and critically interrogate these projects’ utopian aspirations, analyzing their aims and methods for instantiating different ways of being and living, of creating both the happy person and the good society in the image of (and from the) raw data of individuals’ emotions.",

Digitization, online scholarship and open sharing offer opportunity for broader access to manuscripts that are at increased risk in some libraries in the Middle East, offering free access to citizens and scholars.

We test this hypothesis by comparing the out-of-sample predictions of three different multinomial logistic regression models. We discuss our findings with regard to stylistic variation at the level of words and in the context of existing knowledge about literary genres in the Classical Age. We conclude by advocating adding logistical regression to the stylometric toolbox as a flexible way to investigate how authors' writing varies depending on context.",

It combines the advantages of photographic material and standard digital imaging technology to create a long-term migration-less archiving system. This is achieved by the hybrid characteristics of the optical carrier. Any arbitrary binary bit stream is put right besides human readable technical, structural, and contextual metadata. Original files of any appropriate format are stored on film as visual 2D barcodes. This process can be regarded as a materialisation of binary data, which becomes visual and physical. Monolith has no limitation regarding the format of the file to be archived, it doesn't need migration and it doesn't need energy to transport information to the future.",

My approach is to extract and analyse data from intermediate stages of MARY's natural language processing, in order to predict where the beats will fall when the poem is performed or read, and the patterns of sound that this effects. My results demonstrate the validity of this approach, which will soon be rolled out onto the the broad canon of English poetry. Such quantitative analysis will enable me to arrive at a richer and more comprehensive account of developments in poetic form and rhythm. In bringing both new methods and new material into consideration the project has the potential to re-write the history of English poetic form, and of poetic influence, altogether.",

The tool Stemmaweb extends the CollateX graph to allow for user-driven annotation and modification of the graph structure (e.g., merging and splitting of vertices). Despite the attached interaction capabilities, it seems that there is little value put on designing the graphs. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness for improving the readability for Text Variant Graphs. We propose a list of design rules for styling the graph, and its vertices and edges to facilitate a rapid comprehension of the underlying alignment structure by the user.",

        "abstract": "Semi-automated extraction of details corresponding to narratological fabula (raw events) from a corpus of witness statements provides the decontextualized building blocks for identifying narratives that transverse a corpus. This paper describes a framework for assembling those blocks into transversal narratives. Storygraph, our tool, is a novel expansion of parallel-axes coordinate plots that shows the movement of people through the spatiotemporal context of a corpus in a manner agnostic to the source document. This method allows for the emergence of narratives that go beyond the boundaries of one interview. In the context of 503 World Trade Center Task Force Interviews, this technique makes manifest narratives of those who did not testify, but were observed by others who did. These assembled narratives, in cases like Chief Ganci, can reveal stories of those who did not survive. Future work will look at larger spatiotemporal frames, larger corpora, and more diverse violations ecologies.",

Accordingly, few scholars have had the inclination or resources to dedicate to this field of study. The Early Modern OCR Project underway at the Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture at Texas A&M University is making use of historical typography research as a way of improving the OCR process for early modern printed documents. Our Book History team in Texas A&M University’s Cushing Memorial Library and Archives is closely examining printed documents of the early 17th century to identify the differences between two categories of typeface. Their work has been greatly aided by a tool created for the eMOP project. This tool has the potential to change the methods and time requirements for font type research.",

We are finding however, that many page images are of such poor quality that they require some kind of pre-processing before they can be successfully OCR'd.  The eMOP team, along with collaborators from the University of Illinois and Texas A&M University, are creating a post-processing workflow which will allow us to use OCR output to programmatically identify problems that exist in our input page images. This will allow to then apply the appropriate pre-processing to those poor quality page images to produce effective results when those page images are re-OCR'd.",

The conceptual semantic model, written in OWL, includes classes and metadata from standard ontological models related to humanities fields (such as CIDOC or Dublin Core), and adds specific elements and properties to describe poetic phenomena. Its final objective is to interconnect, reuse and locate data disseminated through poetic repertoires, in order to boost interoperability among them.",

        "abstract": "This paper reflects on the concepts of text and modelling to show how objects of analysis and strategy of analysis in Digital Humanities (thereafter DH) research (and teaching) have expanded our boundaries of what is knowledgeable, while at the same time creating other limitations. The authors identify such limitations both at the epistemological level - e.g. the adoption of formalisations that impose a rigid structure on slippery and rich objects of analysis - as well as the linguistic level - e.g. the uncritical adoption of terminology belonging to the domain of computer sciences. The idea of ‘pragmatic modelling’ is therefore proposed as a strategy for research and teaching in DH: the definition of a sort of middle-out approach (halfway between top down and bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling techniques with a constructive use of language. Reflections on metaphorical reasoning will be used to exemplify this approach in practice.",

Shannon Clute and I developed and applied the concept of potential criticism in our 2011 book, The Maltese Touch of Evil: Film Noir and Potential Criticism. Potential criticism, inspired by the work of the Oulipo and recombinatory poetics, is a methodological approach to textual analysis that uses pre-determined mathematical or algorithmic constraints to generate new data sets out of any corpora of digital texts and objects, whether they are alphabetic, visual, or time-based. This paper argues for the broader applicability of potential criticism throughout the digital humanities, since constrained and algorithmic methodologies can be used on any kind of digital text, including video and film, to generate new and unexpected arrangements of data to spur scholarly investigations and discoveries.",

To address such limitations, we built the Chimeria system - a platform built around a dynamic computational model of identity and more flexible group membership dynamics. Chimeria allows for the authoring of narrative experiences that parallel phenomena observed in real world social groups, like the notion of membership gradience and individuals shifting both within and between social groups. Our aim is to allow authors to make use of Chimeria 's underlying model to construct their own narratives pertaining to multiple types of group membership or identity related issues such as discrimination or marginalization. By granting control over the visual appearance, interaction mechanisms, and narrative content, we hope authors will use the platform along with their constructed narratives for both critical analysis and creative expression.",

While some of their collaborative pieces were written with the assistance of other 'salaried staff writers' including Elizabeth Gaskell, Adelaide Anne Proctor, et al., four works are known to have been co-authored by Dickens and Collins alone (Nayder, 2002). These collaborative writings vary in design and style from one another as well as in theme and setting. In some cases, one chapter can be read as radically different from another due to the varying proportion of contribution by each of the duo. The present study applies stylometric techniques in an effort to detect stylistic shifts in the collaborations of Dickens and Collins. The results of this study present internal evidence of how the two authors were 'unequally partnered' with each other.",

Typically thought of as a tool to assist the user in finding a certain location, when used to identify fictional spaces, maps possess the power to convey societal and cultural ideologies. In recent scholarship, there has been a growing interest in the interplay between maps and narrative. “Story maps,” “fictional cartography,” and “geospatial storytelling” are some of the terms utilized to describe the relationship between place and space (Caquard). Our paper takes the current discussion of the connection between narrative and space to another plane by exploring the exchange between fictional spaces and narrative as represented by maps.",

Through a combination of techniques in three-dimensional fabrication, geospatial mapping, speculative computing, and pattern analysis, z-axis research expresses the geospatial narratives of modernist novels by first geo-referencing them and then using that geo-data to deform base layers of historical maps. The output of the research includes warped, 3D maps of cities central to modernist literary production. These maps can be viewed as 3D models on a screen or as physical prototypes in hand, and they are deformed using geo-data drawn from novels by Djuna Barnes, James Joyce, and Jean Rhys, among others. Ultimately, they show scholars how modernist authors wrote the city, and findings suggest that they contradict existing research in modernist studies about how, exactly, cities are represented in modernist novels.",

I maintain, though, that the digital humanities is about breaking stuff. Especially at the undergraduate level, this is the work of the digital humanities that most needs doing. In my undergraduate digital humanities course, the first assignment has students break something as an act of literary criticism. This paper expands upon a brief article I wrote about this assignment, exploring the new pedagogies that the digital humanities demand and give rise to.",

This fact has posited new requirements to the functionalities offered by the Digital Libraries, and thus imposed the usage of methods from Language Technology for content analysis and content presentation in a form understandable to the end user. Language technology tools are mostly adapted in order to make corpus linguistics research but not really used as means for text processing. One of the main barriers is the text readability in terms of language style and terms. The aim of this paper, describing on-going work is to demonstrate that multilingual aspects in historical texts are a big challenge but can serve also for building a knowledge-based to be used in text presentation.",

European women's literary history (until the early 20th century) is considered as being such an under-researched field. In this contribution we will present two case studies illustrating the importance and potentialities of this kind of large, diversified approach. We will also highlight the practical problems they provide, which for the moment are still creating obstacles. We will discuss these obstacles, addressing in particular the gaps between the technological possibilities, the willingness of potential volunteers (in our case often women: those whom we want to empower by our research) and the academic system. We will also propose possible strategies.",

For this short paper session, we propose to share our research on the process of discovery, assessing algorithms used in research and recommendation tools on both scholarship and industry platforms. We will survey existing projects that allow scholars and casual users alike to discover new art. We will also discuss how we plan to incorporate this research as we develop ArtX, a tool that will empower users to discover cultural events, exhibitions, and art objects in the Boston area.",

The design of ClipNotes is deceptively simple: it allows users to mark up video files with metadata in easily-produced XML files that when connected to a video file, allow for precise, granular analysis that is easily disseminated and presented. All XML files are archived in a public database, which allows for widespread sharing of textual analysis and provides an invaluable teaching resource. Examples will be shown of traditional textual analysis amplified by software, as well as a demonstration of how ClipNotes can be integrated into the classroom, allowing students to contribute to an open-access database. ClipNotes demonstrates how software applications can be utilized to enact detailed analysis, archive and disseminate insights, and welcome students into the sphere of knowledge production.",

I use this question to critically explore (1) the present lack of theory to account for an algorithm's effectiveness at identifying authorship and style, (2) the theoretical interdependence of these as exhibited exemplified by concepts such as quality . Identifying an ambiguity in Somers and Tweedie's original question, I reframe the question using a scheme from R. G. Collingwood’s “On the So-Called Idea of Causation.” This allows me to parse the original ambiguity in Somers and Tweedie’s question into several logically distinct classes. This parsing suggests that attributing the success or failure of authorship attribution algorithms to only algorithm _effectiveness_ or pastiche _quality_ effectively equates two incommensurable ontological systems as if they were logically consistent.",

Here, the goal is to develop a heuristic plug-in solution for our text annotation and analysis tool CATMA in order to support both the tagging and the interpretation of narrative time information. Against this backdrop part two of this paper reflects upon the idea of a digital heuristic in more general terms. We believe that the concept per se points us to the digital humanities' methodological challenge to “push back the boundary” of interpretation in a critically reflected manner.",

The new method, CoV Tuning, uses the coefficient of variation, a well-known measure of dispersion, along with the number of texts in the analysis in which the word appears, to \"tune\" the word frequency list in an attempt to improve the analysis of textual similarity and difference. The coefficient of variation is defined as the standard deviation of the frequencies of a word in a set of samples divided by its average frequency in the same samples and multiplied by 100. The method is tested on several diverse sets of texts to show that CoV Tuning works significantly better than the standard word frequency list.",

Ramsay complains that computational approaches to literature lack \"bold statements, strong readings, and broad generalizations,\" and that this helps to explain why computational approaches have not had much influence on literary study. Computational approaches, he says, have been too cautious, to tied to a (pseudo) scientific approaches to interest literary critics, who tend to want to open texts up to new interpretations rather than to solve problems. He begins an algorithmic approach to Virginia Woolf's The Waves in an attempt to model what he sees as a bolder, more provocative, freer kind of computational literary study. This paper reveals some drawbacks of Ramsay's approach, some problems in his algorithmic provocation, and some ways in which a more careful and rigorous approach can provide more insight into Woolf's novel.",

These text files, influenced by a genealogy of informational manuals on the topics of hacking and phreaking, sought to take writing beyond transparent signification, imposing hackerly techniques on to the text itself, by extending, disrupting, and hypermediating codes of discourse. In conventional informational writing, disruption and hypermediation are considered to impede signification; in K-Rad texts, they become key signifying agents. K-Rad writing attempts to push boundaries, to present the unpresentable, and to break all codes, whether legal, moral, linguistic, or typographic. At the 2014 Digital Humanities Conference, I will present a series of K-Rad ASCII text files, demonstrating a sequence of increasingly baroque substitutions and suggesting conceptual reading practices that we might use to engage with these early avant-garde digital texts.",

Using semantic annotation techniques and log-likelihood measures on a 600,000 word corpus of abstract popular science (including a mathematical exposition of number theory, a physics text on parallel universes, and two books on string and quantum theory), the paper digitally demonstrates the existence and the extent of significant analogical content in this corpus. In so doing, it applies Franco Moretti’s ‘distant reading’ programme in the analysis of literary history to non-narrative texts, as well as continuing work on integrating meaning into the methodologies of corpus linguistics.",

We compare a corpora of Russian naive poetry with Russian Poetic corpus, which presents Russian poetical classics from the 18th century till the early 1930th. We look first of all at frequency measures in both resources and analyze the revealing fluctuations of different word frequencies. Then we make a qualitative analysis of the nouns that occur in the top 100 of each frequency list. We identify a range of semantic domains that can be expressed by these nouns and compare the domains of each poetical resource. As a result we define three main strategies of naïve composition: the imitative strategy , the self-actualization strategy and the extensive strategy .",

Although we primarily focus the facilitation of a combined broad and deep search with a virtual, query-time integration, the proposed concept also addresses requirements of a materialized integration of research data on granularity levels required by focused disciplinary or interdisciplinary research projects . The three main topics that are being discussed are the evolution of semantic clusters which contain the reusable background knowledge, our use-case orientation and scalability considerations .",

The author constructs an agent-based model in NetLogo consisting of two interacting levels: (1) a genetic algorithm in which cultural forms (e.g., works of literature, pieces of music, etc.) are represented as binary feature strings. Cultural forms evolve across generations via asexual and sexual reproduction. Genres are represented as hierarchical clusters of similar feature strings. (2) Cultural forms are subjected to the selection pressure of consumer preferences. Preferences are heterogeneous: each consumer's tastes are represented by an ideal point in feature space. Preferences are configured in landscapes that vary in their levels of structure, entropy, and diversity. Landscapes are dynamic and may change due to (i) exogenous demographic shifts (e.g., population growth, generational turnover) or (ii) endogenous feedback (e.g., conformity / anti-conformity effects).",

Exemplary subject matter of the inquiry will be a selection of recovered materials from harddrives in the Thomas Kling archive which represents the range of retrievable transitory 'genetic' textual material, e.g. recoverable documents, temporary files, memory fragments and several disk operation artifacts on multiple generations of operating systems. The harddrives have been forensically imaged for longterm preservation by the author of this paper and by a forensic laboratory recently, and it will be the first time these findings are being publicly discussed.",

        "abstract": "Narrative has become an active research focus in the artificial intelligence community in recent years, with efforts aimed at the construction of computational models for storytelling and story understanding. AI researchers often speak of narrative as its own form of intelligence—a complex cognitive phenomenon encompassing natural language understanding and generation, common-sense reasoning, analogical reasoning, planning, physical perception, imagination, and social cognition. Computational models of narrative draw upon a multitude of different techniques from the AI toolkit, ranging from detailed symbolic knowledge representation to large-scale statistical analyses. Our purpose in proposing this panel for DH2014 is two-fold. First, we want to introduce literary critics to parallel efforts underway in AI-narrative research and computational modeling. Second, we want to open a dialogue about the process for and implications of operationalizing canonical narrative theories, especially those from Russian Formalism and French Structuralism, for the computational analysis and generation of stories.",

Using a new method that combines a series of rule-based analyses with an iterative probabilistic-based classification algorithm, we can now detect, with a high degree of accuracy, both the meter and line length of individual poems. We have trained our algorithm to recognize individual metrical feet, such as iambs, dactyls, anapests, trochees, and spondees, and to combine these identifications with a signal-processing approach to the entire poem to classify the overall metrical scheme of any given poem. We have trained and tested our algorithm on a corpus of over 300,000 English language poems from the late medieval period to the twentieth century. We have also applied our algorithm to multi-lingual corpora, including German and French.",

Specifically, we identify three general ways that geographical technologies can enrich our understanding of texts: first, distant reading using Geographical Text Analysis (GTA), a combination of techniques from GIS-based spatial analysis and from corpus linguistics; second, enhanced close reading based on using place names or maps as query tools; and third, geographical analyses of the texts using techniques such as network analysis and route reconstruction. The aim of these three approaches is to go beyond simply producing visualisations, and instead to allow us to improve our understanding of the text with an emphasis on its geographies.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents findings of an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded project conducted at Penn State University in the period April 2012-June 2013. Through a web survey and ethnographic interviews, the project explored scholarly workflow of 196 Penn State faculty across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences, focusing on the integration of digital technologies at all stages of a research lifecycle—from collecting and analyzing data, over managing and storing research materials, to writing up and sharing research findings. This paper harvests a comparative multidisciplinary perspective of our study in order to explore specificities of humanities scholars’ digital workflow, providing a ground to identify and develop a software and service architecture that supports those practices. Therefore, while focusing on current findings, the paper briefly highlights the future trajectory of our study, as well as planned next steps regarding technological initiatives aimed at addressing management of digital scholarly workflow in humanities scholarship.",

The process of creating such a collection involves the attribution of metadata to each of the constituent images, and to the corpus as a whole. The photograph produces varied readings and thus poses a problem in the creation of their metadata. Whatever we can inscribe within the metadata is dependent on what we can articulate about that cultural object. My paper will explore the formation of metdata through the analysis (a combination of statistical and close-reading) of a body of annotated photographs. I propose to demonstrate means of extracting meaningful metadata in order to place them within established formats. I will also demonstrate new methods of visualising large image collection through the use of this form of analysis.",

However, we propose to concentrate more of our presentation on a reflexive analysis of our own design activity in the development of this tool. We propose three axes of reflexive exploration about our experience in building the prototype : 1) reflexion about the studied material, 2) ethical aspects of designing the interface and 3) reflection on our design (and coding) practice.",

This study analyzes the textual differences among perspectives in contemporary novels using computational stylistic methods, i.e., text classification and feature analyses by random forests. We selected two novels by Kotaro Isaka, a popular Japanese novelist, who explicitly switches perspective in his novels section by section. The results indicate that (a) perspectives have specific textual characteristics, (b1) textual characteristics specific to respective scenes such as proper nouns are important for differentiating perspective, and (b2) stylistic characteristics such as pronouns and nouns that represent styles of speech are also important. We conclude that computational stylistic methods are effective for analyzing the difference among perspectives in contemporary novels.",

This paper looks at book ratings on a book discussion site and tries to assess the role of individual readers' characteristics in these ratings. The question it tries to answer is whether the words that readers use can help explain which books they rate highly. I study a Dutch book discussion site. Looking at word usage patterns in several word categories (function words, cognitive, social and affective words), I show the existence of correlations between word frequencies and book ratings. I also show how usage of social words can help define a clustering of users that are clearly different in word usage and somewhat different in book preferences.",

The project’s aim is to build a comprehensive online multimedia digital archive that documents architectural practice in post-war Queensland (1945-1975) – a period that was highly significant but largely undocumented. This paper describes the innovative Semantic Web technologies that have been implemented to link tacit knowledge extracted from individual oral histories to tangible knowledge (drawings, books, photographs, manuscripts) that has been retrieved from personal, firm and State archives, digitized and uploaded to this online archive. It also describes the services that have been developed to enable architectural historians to document and discuss relationships between architects, firms, buildings/places and events.",

The Austrian example will be used to showcase some of the most obvious and momentous shortcomings of current IPR legislature, and will be compared with German and UK/US legal approaches. In conclusion, the paper will try to define a possible best practice which draws on the analysis of the common denominators found in (inter)national legal systems.",

It presents the outcomes of an experiment with the development, preservation and reuse of animations of static illustrations of scientific laws, processes and the working of mechanical instruments and tools. The experiment did not limit itself to creation of animated visualizations, but comprehended workflows for re-use and the development of business models leading to animated discussions about historic methodologies, the ownership and responsibility of external links and issues of copy and author rights.",

Ramsay's notion of deformance , linked to a conception of the speculative humanities that prizes the perpetuation of critical discussion, may de-emphasize attention to the algorithms being used to facilitate literary insight. To wit, we show in detail how the \"deformed text\" Ramsay produces from The _Waves_ using a tf-idf algorithm cannot be reproduced by the procedure he describes in Reading _Machines_. We show how carefully and accurately describing Ramsay's procedure (as he himself does not) engenders more valuable and more interesting conversations about literature and literary interpretation precisely because doing so foregrounds interpretative decisions and assumptions.",

However, in displaying search results, digital tools have lacked one of characteristics of older print concordances, which typically present the key word in its context on one line of text with the context carefully chosen so as to maximize the reader’s understanding of the key word’s context given the space limitations. In this paper, I present an algorithmic approach to mimic a human’s activity in choosing the context for a given line length and font. This results in a presentation of search results almost as good as a human would choose without the tens or even hundreds of person-years required for traditional print concordances. Moreover, unlike print concordances, this algorithmic approach is flexible, accommodating changes in line length and font.",

Serendip-o-matic is a “serendipity engine” that was created in less than a week by twelve digital humanities scholars, developers, librarians. Designed to replicate the surprising experience of discovering an unexpected source while browsing library stacks or working in an archive, the visual and algorithmic design of Serendip-o-matic emphasizes playfulness. And since the tool was built by a group of people who weren’t yet sure of one another’s names, the process of building Serendip-o-matic was also rather playful. In this presentation, we report on how play shaped the creation, design, and marketing of Serendip-o-matic. We conclude by arguing for the benefits of more playful work in academic research and scholarship, as well as considering how such “play” can be evaluated in an academic context.",

Nor has an open digital research corpus been available. The research team developing Coptic SCRIPTORIUM (Sahidic Corpus Research: Internet Platform for Interdisciplinary multilayer Methods) is developing and providing open-source technologies and methodologies for interdisciplinary research across multiple disciplines in the Coptic language.

The paper will conclude with a look at the lessons learned, the next steps, and broader implications of this research.

Nancy Davenport, previous president of CLIR, concludes that users want unfettered access and better discovery tools for what she calls “deep listening” (what Charles Bernstein calls “close listening”) or “listening for content, in note, performance, mood, texture, and technology.” It is a typical digital humanities problem: Without a better understanding of what such listening entails, we cannot build tools that afford such listening; because we lack the tools, humanists struggle to imagine how to describe the access they want -- what Jerome McGann calls “imagining what you don’t know.” In an attempt to imagine how to facilitate distant listening with computation, this paper positions user requirements for critical listening software within the context of critical listening theories.",

The goal is to create a new online resource that will add a new and heretofore underutilised perspective to the events of the period that will form the basis for a revision of our understanding of life in Ireland in the early 20th Century. This paper will explore phase I of the project: the sourcing, gathering, and transcribing/encoding of collection.

Through direct engagement with notable digital writers, we explore issues of reusability and obsolescence in electronic literature.

In an effort to scrutinise this matter, we focus our attention on two of the field’s most prominent anthologies, the Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 1 (2006) and Volume 2 (2011), curated by the Electronic Literature Organization.",

However, there is also the potential for computational stylistics to make a contribution in stylometry beyond authorship attribution and in the wider area of literary interpretation. Here the problem of validation is acute. If a surprising finding emerges from a quantitative study, how can we tell a chance result, or an artefact of method, from a well-founded finding? The best first options may be other areas of classification, where validation is still possible, like chronology and genre study, but the bigger challenge and greatest rewards will be in interpretation in the wider sense. This panel approaches the question of validation in computational stylistics beyond authorship attribution through case studies in a variety of languages and literary traditions. Each case study discusses issues of validation and interpretation and offers some considerations of the wider questions of method which arise.",

In this system, I intend to implement correlation filtering at the word, rather than the character level, and model the causal relationships between regions of interest at the sentence, rather than the word level, in order to improve and streamline text identification over existing methods. This project should serve to empower both paleographers and computer scientists alike, as it explores the relationship between traditional methods of text analysis and mathematical ones.",

However, it was difficult to grasp women victims’ requirements timely, because they were really patient and their needs were sometimes neglected under the environments and conditions that had changed from moment to moment. We need a more useful and easily way to obtain women victims’ needs. To properly detect and analyze needs of women victims, we set our research goal was a development of an advisory message board for women victims on the web. To achieve our goal, this paper aims to make clear issues for acquiring women victims’ needs and propose the frame work of an advisory message board for women victims after disasters. In our proposed message board, women victims can post their messages (requirements/opinions/complaints) freely, and data mining techniques are utilized to analyze messages and detect specific needs.",

Although a deeper understanding of how the news is represented in moving images promises to improve access to historical records, participation in public dialogue, and education at all levels, large corpora of video news programs are considerably more difficult to catalog, mine, and visualize than text news collections. Furthermore, new forms of dissemination, annotation, and commentary made possible by the Internet are rapidly transforming video news consumption on a global scale. “Visualizing Global News” studies how excerpts from large collections of political speech videos with historically significant personages are remixed into even larger collections of news broadcasts.",

Through comparisons of the two knowledge structures and cited texts, we observed several significant changes in the worldview between the two era, which suggest that the rationalism movement of Song dynasty might already have begun in late Tang.",

The combination of diverse data from varying sources not only enriches our knowledge of these otherwise mostly forgotten texts; it also confronts us with vague, uncertain or even conflicting information. While the project operates at the intersection of historical and literary studies, the involved computer scientists are in charge of providing a working environment (Entrup et al. 2013b) and processing the collected information in a way that is formalized yet capable of dealing with inevitable vagueness, uncertainty and contradictions.

The twenty-four hours under investigation are marked by so-called \"Türkenbefreiungsfeiern.\" These events, celebrating the 250th anniversary of Vienna's liberation from the Turkish siege in 1683, were oriented from the outset upon processes of mass communication. \"Campus Medius\" reconstructs the media events of this time-space and traces them back to historical media \"dispositifs.\" Hence, the project consists of two parts: a mapped topography of its actors within the Urban Research Tool and a narrated topology of the underlying knowledge forms, power relations, and subjectivation modes within Zeega.",

Can we distinguish texts found good or bad, literary or non-literary, by readers based on formal features in these texts? And how do the opinions of readers correlate with the kind of reader they are? The project aims to correlate formal features analyzed through a chain of μServices. Readers’ opinions and roles were assessed through an online survey and resulted in almost 14.000 respondents.",

        "abstract": "Description (as opposed to narration) is an often underestimated element of prose fiction in literary theory. We aim to extract a specific type of description from recent Dutch novels, namely descriptions of characters' physical appearance. In this abstract, two methods for extraction are compared: (1) manual development of lexical-linguistic patterns and (2) a Naive Bayes and an SVM classifier. The tests are undertaken on a corpus of 16 chick-lit and 16 literary novels. Performance of the machine learning method (precision, recall and F-measure) is considerably better than that of the lexical-linguistic patterns. The patterns do however give better insight in the shape and format of the descriptions themselves. In future research, both methods might be combined to improve results.",

These co-occurrences are turned into a social graph that connects persons with each other and positions them, through information about the date and location of recording, in time and space. The resulting visualization of the graph as well as analytical tools can help historians to find new impulses for research and to unearth previously unknown relationships.",

The first relied on a traditional textual introduction, the second provided the same information through a series of user-invoked Google pins. The crew agreement, a 19th century document detailing work on board a vessel of the British merchant marine, was used to see how undergraduate students navigate and learn to decipher a complex historical text. Extensive work with a small group of students revealed important lessons for anyone thinking of using a documentary series in a teaching environment or on a public history web site.",

It is compelling both in terms of organization and content and amounts to a comprehensive textual index. In addition to the historical allure of its content, the formal properties of the digitized documents made available through the Perseus Collection make the Dispatch an extraordinary raw material for building a rich interactive visual experience that augments the textual one. This project demonstrates best practices for implementing a single-page application (SPA) using the emergent tools/frameworks found in modern web/social applications, which greatly facilitates the exploration of the Richmond Times Dispatch and can be generally applied to other TEI-based collections in future efforts (by us or others).",

At its heart are transfer processes that extended across individual, familial and local realms and had a long-term impact. EGO traces these transfer processes in and between, amongst others, the realms of religion, law, politics, art, music, literature, economics, technology and the military, science and medicine. From the technical point of view EGO is based on a sophisticated infrastructure which supports the editorial board and is used to provide the online publication. For these purposes the content management system Plone is used, which is a very powerful environment developed for professional use.",

Finding variations is important for researchers in bibliography and book history as well. The area of collation awaits a lot more from technology. There is a need of a tool that can reduce the effort required in the collation process while maintaining (and sometimes improving) the usefulness and allowing scholars to use original documents (high quality facsimiles). This research focuses on this aspect of scholarly work and explores various approaches for performing digital collation in a seamlessly easy manner .A prototype of the virtual Hinman(vHinman) collator was created and user-evaluation was conducted amongst scholars experienced with collation work.. Image-matching algorithms along with context information are used to match words and the tool was integrated into the creativity support environment CritSpace",

        "abstract": "In this presentation, we describe the development of two experimental prototypes, the \"Glass Cast,\" a prototype for mapping and visualizing complex knowledge networks in which time is crucial, and on “PlotVis,” an interactive visualization resource for displaying XML-encoded fictional narratives that departs from ways of modeling narrative typical of literary pedagogy. In describing the considerations that informed the design and development of these in-progress prototypes, we contribute to ongoing theorization of the role of visualization, broadly conceived, in digital humanities scholarship. We also examine the implications for visualization of the metaphors implicit to the respective structures of our experimental prototypes. We ask, \"How does metaphor shape and perhaps even constrain perceptions of the purpose of visualization, particularly as a way of thinking through complex problems?\"",

Customary outreach activities are limited in their reach and effectiveness: bringing traditional humanities scholars into digital humanities scholarship is time and labor intensive, and publicity for projects and tools often targets specific audiences, leaving out constituencies that are institutionally or strategically important for the center’s growth. Student participants are often better situated than faculty to adopt digital technologies and approaches, and to serve as advocates for the center within and beyond the academy. We are developing our rationale and strategies to strengthen student involvement in digital scholarship with attention not only to potential benefits but also local constraints and ethical concerns.",

To address this question, this paper presents a library science derived model for facilitating codex to online textual transmission based on the work of textual theorist John Bryant’s fluid text theory. We briefly describe the model and how it provides a method for aggregating related bibliographical and archival evidence around a target text. We demonstrate the model by providing three examples. We seek to illustrate the potential of the fluid text theory in providing a model for textual transmission online that unlocks the latent information surrounding those texts contained in libraries and archives. We then close speculating on what type of documenting infrastructure would be needed for citing such textual influences in an online publishing environment absent the familiar pages and page numbering of the codex.",

More specifically, we ask how the exploratory thematic analysis of documents might be incorporated into the initial phase of humanities research, while remaining accessible to non-technical scholars. Our examples derive from the antislavery newspapers of the 19th-century United States, which are significant not only because they function as the primary record of the sociopolitical machinations that culminated in slavery’s abolition, but also because they are among the earliest examples of women writing alongside men for a general audience. Our analysis thus reveals how passed between social and political coalitions, with an emphasis on how ideas were framed differently by male and female writers.",

We adapt several techniques which have proven useful for author identification to the problem of predicting various aspects of a user’s personality.

Here, we adapt the MBTI prediction system to work by analyzing a user’s computer usage instead. We also introduce systems to predict the user’s most preferential Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS) subcategories.",

As such, this paper and presentation will outline and demonstrate visual methods and considerations for implementing such perceived networked histories. It will also discuss the different aspects of the framework Mojulem, and its four fundamental cores, and ground such a discussion within the example of the ongoing Woolf Online project.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, large collections of historical manuscripts exist, which contain valuable information about our cultural heritage. Recently, there has been much interest in their digitization for preservation reasons. Digitization though is only the first step to make the information contained in manuscripts accessible to researchers and to the interested public. Further processing steps need to be applied, so that the manuscript's content is transformed into a form that is interpretable by a computer. One important step is that of text line extraction. In this paper, we propose a binarization-free text line extraction method using seam carving. The main idea is to compute an energy map of the input text blocks and determine minimum energy paths through them. The energy map is constructed in a way so that gaps between text lines have low energy values and a minimum energy path will successfully pass through these gaps.",

Digitization has been done thus far on the literature of several ages and various text corpora have been published. However, each element of the text corpora is marked up under NINJAL’s Document Type Definition, which is basically neither unified nor standardized. Under this circumstance it causes problems with structural analysis and numerical analyses between several corpora. Thus, it is necessary to mark up texts using a unified definition from a higher level to conduct analyses concurrently. In the previous study, we examined the possibility of converting classic documents with TEI-compliant XML by designing a tag-set and strictly structuring a wood-block printed book from Sharebon’s as a model case. In this study, we further examine the problems of (A) text formatting on character data level and (B) structuring ruby annotation which were previously unsolved.",
