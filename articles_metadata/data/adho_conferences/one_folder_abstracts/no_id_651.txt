Of the qualities claimed to be normal for work in the digital humanities, $2 is perhaps the least well understood. Discussion of this quality is either dominated by the ontological question, “what is interdisciplinarity?”, or considered solely in terms of collaboration among researchers from different disciplines. Neither helps the individual researcher (whether working alone or as part of a team) understand how to think his or her way into the disciplines of others and understand what they have to offer from their own perspective. In the proposed paper I will discuss the problem and illustrate a way forward by describing a doctoral-level course in interdisciplinary research that I have taught for the last three years.
