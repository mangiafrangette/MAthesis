This paper presents an experiment in "investigative tagging" applied to a project that is building an archive of early modern collections of curiosities. It proposes that before we begin imposing a structure on our material of study, we need to discover the shape of the data as it presents itself in these materials. The design of this experiment is presented here, along with analysis of the results and their implication for the project, as well as some observations about the experiment and its implementation.
