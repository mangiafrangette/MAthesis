SoundBox, a two-year project funded by the new PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge at Duke University, explores new ways of incorporating sound into digital scholarly productions. It does so primarily by hosting a series of "provocations" — that is, essays, experiments and events both digital and local — that challenge those who experience them to imagine a noisier form of scholarship. An archive of these provocations will be published online. This paper explores the project's goals and outcomes, and uses our experiences with SoundBox as a case study in how to incorporate Digital Humanities into the graduate curriculum.
