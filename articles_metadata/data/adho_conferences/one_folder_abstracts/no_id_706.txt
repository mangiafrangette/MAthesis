The Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI) is a national “Virtual Laboratory” which is being developed as part of the Australian government’s NeCTAR (National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources) programme. HuNI is using Linked Data to combine a range of different Australian datasets and deploying a suite of software tools to enable researchers to work with the data in various ways. The HuNI project began in May 2012 and is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2013. It is being developed through a partnership between thirteen public institutions, led by Deakin University in Melbourne. At the Digital Humanities 2012 conference we presented a short paper on the overall design and proposed architecture for HuNI. We now propose a long paper reporting on HuNI’s progress in its first twelve months and demonstrating the initial version of the Virtual Laboratory.
