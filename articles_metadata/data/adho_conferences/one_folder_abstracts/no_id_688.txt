This paper presents a strategy for loosely coupling datasets in two mature digital projects by constructing a database of links between London toponyms mentioned in early modern dramatic texts in the Internet Shakespeare Editions and the placeography which is at the heart of the Map of Early Modern London project. The approach uses named entity recognition and similarity metrics, and will result in a new dataset which enables each project to integrate information from the other.
