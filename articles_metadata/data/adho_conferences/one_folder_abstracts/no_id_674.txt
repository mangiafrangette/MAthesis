We use a tool we developed, called the Networked Corpus, to compare concepts of topical knowledge in the eighteenth-century and today. By comparing the topic modeling output of the Networked Corpus to eighteenth-century indices and commonplace books, we interrogate a historical notion of topical knowledge and the epistemological features of the "topic" in current topic modeling algorithms. In addition, we compare the statistical results from our comparison with the conclusions of traditional scholarly approaches to topical knowledge in the eighteenth century.
