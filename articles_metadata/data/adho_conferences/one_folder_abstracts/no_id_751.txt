This year the Medici Archive Project (MAP), based in the State Archive in Florence, launches BIA, an interactive on-line digital platform, thanks to the generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. This ambitious project is in the process of digitizing around four million handwritten letters dating from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries which are part of the Medici Granducal Archive, 1537-1743. Eventually MAP will publish digital images of these historical documents on BIA, which were formerly accessible only onsite in Florence. Along with each image, BIA will also provide a transcription of each document in its original language, accompanied by an English-language synopsis, which places the document within a historical context. The completion of this vast undertaking has become a real possibility by using crowdsourcing and digital editing techniques.
