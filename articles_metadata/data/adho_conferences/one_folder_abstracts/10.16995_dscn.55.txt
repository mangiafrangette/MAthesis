While plagiarism in digital classrooms has been am important topic of discussion in the literature on post-secondary teaching and learning, too often this discussion has been framed in unhelpful polemic and moral terms. In contrast, this paper argues that using a peer-evaluation flipped marking system in a learning management system (LMS) as part of a plagiarism deterrence strategy can help to create a learning environment where students engage with the ideas of their peers and begin to feel like their ideas matter to others. In such a climate, students may feel less alienated from the university community and more connected to the class and their peers, and as such, they may be less likely to plagiarise their work. A way to deal with plagiarism is to help students become engaged with their peers as fellow academics and as members of micro academic communities.
