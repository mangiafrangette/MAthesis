Although the semantic web has transformed some thinking about scholarship in fields like the Life Sciences, to many in the humanities it seems far less relevant. This proposal suggests a place for the semantic web in conventional humanities research by exploring a model for structuring traditional scholarship — based on methodologies in use for the managing and organising of notetaking — that introduces a personal space that can support conventional scholarship activities, but that is sufficiently structured to bridge the gap between the nature of personal scholarship and the formal, public, context of the semantic web.
