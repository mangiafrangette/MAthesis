Our preliminary trials are designed to explore what sorts of tools and visualizations might be truly useful for something as complex as a television episode or feature film. What sorts of patterns might arise, for example, if we look at a visualization of a script in juxtaposition with a spectrogram of the audio track? How can we look at the spatial and temporal difference between pixel color from one frame to the next as it might relate to a motion analysis? We are excited about some early work in this field done by others, and hope our experiments will contribute to the discourse and develop a more robust model of quantitative, algorithmic analysis of digital video objects.
