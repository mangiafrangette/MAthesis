>To date, computational geography (born in the late 1950s but distinguished as GIScience for a couple decades now) has concerned itself with quantitative analyses of spatial and spatial-temporal aspects of natural phenomena at geographic scales. However social scientists and, more obviously, humanist scholars have questions concerning human experience of space and space-time. In recent years, GIScience has increasingly been adding methods more directly supporting qualitative analysis. I present an example from my own work integrating remote sensing imagery with demographic variables to create a measure of "nature-ness" â€”the human sense of being in a natural place, as a step towards explaining the enormous variation of the experience of nature within and across US cities.
