In early 2010, the Austrian Academy of Sciencesâ€™ ICLTT instituted an experiment in selective metadata creation for a medium-sized collection (<100 million tokens) of digitised periodicals. The project has two main objectives: (a) assigning basic structures to previously digitised texts, so-called divisions in TEI nomenclature, thus creating a set of new digital objects, and (b) the subsequent categorisation of these texts with the purpose of being able to create thematically organised sub-corpora. An additional objective was to have metadata stored as TEI headers.
