The paper explores the style of characters in a corpus of epistolary novels written in Dutch in the late 18th- and early 19th-century. The main aim is to find out whether the characters in the novels are distinguishable as to their writing style. An additional question is whether the two co-authors of three of the novels can be identified in the letters of certain fictional characters. The method used is stylometric authorship attribution by means of an R-script developed by Eder, Rybicki and added to by Kestemont.
