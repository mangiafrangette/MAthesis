Computer simulation is the only practical way to model diffusion of cultural features, including speech. This paper describes the use of cellular automata to model feature diffusion as the adaptive aspect of the complex system of speech. Throughout hundreds of iterations that correspond to the daily interaction of speakers across time, we can watch regional distributional patterns emerge as a consequence of simple update rules. The key feature of our simulations is validation with respect to distributions known to occur in survey data. We also apply a GIS-aware method for combining the effect of geographical proximity with social characteristics. Our successful simulation confirms our complex systems approach, and also suggests how we can simulate features among different social groups.
