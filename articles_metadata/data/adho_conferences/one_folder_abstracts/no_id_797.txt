In this paper we describe a hosting environment,CRADLE, that is configurable and generalisable. At An Foras Feasa we repeatedly faced the same meta-Use Cases; researchers wished to create digital versions of their source-system (which might either be a single source represented by components within the system e.g. a manuscript of page-components, or multiple sources connected together, e.g. an archive of diverse materials1) that were reflective of their own, personal theoretical opinions, provided tools for investigation of those sources, and permitted re-use of many types such as teaching and learning. It was desirable that other researchers would be able to reinterpret and repurpose hosted digital source-systems to create a digital version consistent with their own theoretical position. This implied that any solution would need to be able to handle multiple, configurable, versions of a digital source-systems, and multiple metadata descriptions of any single component within the source-system.
