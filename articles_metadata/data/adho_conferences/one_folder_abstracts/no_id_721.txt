Bibliopedia, which recently completed an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant, performs data-mining and cross-referencing of scholarly literature to create a humanities-centered collaboratory. It uses semantic web technology to enable automated textual analysis, data extraction, cross-referencing, and visualizations of the relationships among texts and authors. Using existing open source software, it extracts citation data from existing plain text resources and transforms them into linked open data. This process makes the information easily accessible to the wider scholarly and linked data communities, enables network visualizations of the scholarly landscape. This short paper uses the lessons learned from Bibliopedia to argue for the necessity and usefulness of adopting semantic web technologies in digital humanities research projects. This paper also argues for the benefit of deploying open source technologies whenever possible, a method that has enabled a small team to construct a working prototype of a complex system in a short time.
