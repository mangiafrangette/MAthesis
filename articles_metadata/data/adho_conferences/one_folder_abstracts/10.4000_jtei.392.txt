Within the Teuchos Group at the University of Hamburg we developed a software package that integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as modules for automatic annotation of manuscripts. The main advantage of such a system is that the user works entirely in plain text, not needing to learn markup, with the system only saving in TEI P5 once the manuscript description is complete. This paper presents our software package, which includes a module for generating P5-conformant manuscript descriptions as well as several modules for automatic deep annotation of the manuscript transcription at the phrase level.
