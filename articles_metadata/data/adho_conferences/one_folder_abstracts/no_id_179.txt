It is traditional, in philology, to date a text by using as a “terminus post quem” the date of first attestation of certain words. The use of a great data base as Frantext makes it possible to envisage the automation of this operation, and consequently its application to all the words of a text, which would increase the precision of the dating. A certain number of precautions (choice of the reference corpus, recognition of the graphic variations...) must be taken to perform this operation, which can be improved by the taking into account, beyond the only date of first attestation, of the frequency of use, throughout the history of the language, of the words of the text to be dated. The dating of the vocabulary of a text also makes it possible to appreciate the degree of archaism and neology implemented by the author, which has applications in stylistics and history of the genres. One will consider also the use of dictionaries of attestations to carry out these operations of dating, dictionaries existing or to be constituted to this end. The examples will relate as well, for validation, to texts whose date is known in literary history and to texts whose dating is the subject of controversies.
