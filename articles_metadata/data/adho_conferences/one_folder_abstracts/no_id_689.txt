This short paper seeks to introduce the Digital Humanities community to three ongoing, interrelated projects: the Media History Digital Library (an open access digital resource, www.mediahistoryproject.org), Lantern (a search tool, http://lantern-demo.commarts.wisc.edu/) and Coding Media History (a text mining research project). Together, these three projects aim to use digital technology to transform the field of Film and Media Studies, a discipline that has lagged English and History in the creation of high impact DH work. I would also like to suggest that the three interrelated projects demonstrate a productive model for scaffolding work in the Digital Humanities. The three sides of my work—enabling access, building tools, and text analysis—support and enhance one another.
