In this paper, we argue that the digital humanities community, which has an ongoing interest in studying the literary dimensions of gender, is at an opportune moment to join the conversation on gender theories from other disciplines. Moreover, we suggest that DH can take a leadership role in moving beyond the assumptions of binary gender, and instead engage with non-binary gender in meaningful and tangible ways through DH teaching and research.
