In the early days of the TEI Guidelines, academic libraries extended their access and preservation mandates to include electronic text, providing expertise in authority control, subject analysis, and bibliographic description.

This paper presents the results of a survey targeting library employees to learn more about text-encoding practices and to gauge current attitudes toward text encoding.
