This article tries to show the strict interdependence of the concepts of text, time, and truth in relation to textual transmission. It develops the thesis that the identity of the text is a function of a series of actors working on the historic, cultural, religious, and other levels. It offers the example of the origination of the Old Testament, which is considered the real foundational act of Western practices of identity construction/reconstruction. This event generated the metaphysics of the text that produced the overlapping of theological and philological truth. Nonetheless, the digital dimension seems potentially able to call into crisis the pact of identity that is based on the assumed stability of the written document and the idea of time that derives from it. The present scenario sees a tension between the data preservation/retrieval paradigm and the creative/performative style of online writing. We are facing a dialogue and interaction with and between machines that the methods and traditional tools of the humanist sciences find increasingly difficult to understand, describe, and map.
