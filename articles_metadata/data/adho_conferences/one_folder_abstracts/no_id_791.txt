The Book of Hours is perhaps the most ubiquitous type of surviving medieval manuscripts. Each unique book contains a wealth of information about liturgical practices, social and private use of books, manuscript production and decoration, and personal and local choices for the creation of private devotional collections. Each Book of Hours contains a Kalendar that lists feast days for the entire year. These document the standard days for liturgical celebration, but are filled with local and temporal variants that paint a picture of the ways in which practices change according to regional interests over the centuries. This paper describes the design and implementation of a comparative Kalendar built from distributed resources served from multiple participating tools and repositories.
