A central concern of digital humanities has been how satisfactorily a digital transcription or facsimile represents its object of study. Integral to various interventions is a distinction between the material form and linguistic content of source material and a desire to bring audiences closer to both. My proposed paper will discuss my continuing project for the UNL's Center for Digital Research in the Humanities to build a dynamic, visually-rich, and critically nuanced history of Willa Catherâ€™s Death Comes for the Archbishop (1927) as a series of material objects in multiple forms, including but not limited to manuscripts, notable editions, notebooks, translations, and interviews. I report on the challenges I have encountered in this process and explain some of the decisions I've faced.
