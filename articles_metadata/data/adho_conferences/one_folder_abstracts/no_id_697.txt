The social web — broadly defined as the array of technologies that allow individuals to post their thoughts and comments in a public forum — offers significant potential to explore new and enduring humanities questions. Against the backdrop of the on-going sesquicentennial commemorations, we examine the intersection of humanities, social media, and computing to probe enduring questions around the legacy of the Civil War. We illustrate how an ongoing study that uses the Civil War serves as a testbed for examining and developing techniques to conduct traditional types of humanistic inquiry in the context of the social web. Our results demonstrate how careful analysis of the online discourse that occurs across the social web enables deeper understanding of how the Lost Cause Ideology continues to recast the origins of the war and minimize the role of slavery.
