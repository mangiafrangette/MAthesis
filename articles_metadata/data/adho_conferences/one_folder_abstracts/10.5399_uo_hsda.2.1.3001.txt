This paper addresses the modern crisis of the philosophical project that conceived of literature as mathesis universalis. In the digital universe, literature maintains its relationship with truth, which is no longer considered as transcending the process of knowing, but as given in unity with it. The new statute of the text is captured well by Carlo Sini’s idea of “foglio-mondo” (“world-page”). Sini suggests that the desacralized text is not situated “outside” of truth; it does not become, as happens in many postmodern thinkers, play, deceit, and gratuitous narration. Rather, “foglio-mondo” is the text freed from the tutelage of transcendental truth to become an “event” of truth.
