Also in traditional research fields like the Humanities, Web is becoming a primary source for data and research material as well as a fundamental medium for communication and collaboration. In this scenario, new software tools are required that could integrate in the Web environment, i.e. where data is available, and support users in their basic activities — the so-called scholarly primitives — such as annotation, augmentation and contextualization. Finally, the result of these activities that constitutes itself valuable knowledge, should be externalized, i.e. made available not only other researchers and to entire mankind. This paper briefly introduces Pundit: a novel Web-based annotation tool that allows scholars to augment Web page contents with semantically structured data. In this way, user-created knowledge can not only be easily made available to other researches, enabling collaboration, but also further recombined with other data in external applications and used beyond the context they originated from.
