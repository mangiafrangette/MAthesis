This paper focuses on a thought experiment in which the authors propose an encoding system not unlike the contextual markup of prosopographies or gazetteers using TEI P5 that could be used to capture the particular financial semantics involved in HFRs. This possible system is expressed as a TEI “extension” customization, and is flexible enough to encode the subgenre of financial records called “double-entry accounts,” a bookkeeping method for recording transfers of goods or services in exchange for currency or credit.
