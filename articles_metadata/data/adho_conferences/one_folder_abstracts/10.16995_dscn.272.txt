TheCulturist.ca is the result of a term long course within the Digital Humanities Minor for undergraduate students, worked on in collaboration with the CulturePlex Lab at Western University. An experiment in independent journalism and multimedia production, this website highlights research undertaken by undergraduate students incorporating various disciplines in an attempt to make their academic work accessible to and garnering attention from a wider public outside the university. Students in charge of creating and maintaining the project work collaboratively and produce a best practices document while learning the strategies involved in organically generating a user base for their content online.
