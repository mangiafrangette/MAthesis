XML-Print is a typesetting engine for complex XML data and sophisticated requirements, e.g. for critical editions, interfaced via an ergonomic user interface. Its version 1.0 release is already a viable option for simple typesetting needs. In DH 2012 we have presented the project’s infrastructure and general concepts. This paper concentrates on four areas of realized or planned developments, often driven by the requirements of pilot project’s testing the system:  — Handling an arbitrary number of critical apparatuses, each possibly long, with flexibly referencing systems — Parallelizing the typesetting engine, leveraging the capabilities of the chosen implementation language F# — Handling bidirectional texts, in particular for Hebrew and Arabic, in compliance to the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm — Test concepts for a heavily visual project, enhancing the testing framework Sikuli to automatically compare reference images against the generated output to create test reports
