Supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenb√ºttel, have digitized 723 Renaissance emblem books, thereby substantially expanding the digitized corpus that includes detailed descriptions for more than 18,000 individual emblems. The metadata-based OpenEmblem Portal prototype was built to provide access to these digital contents and demonstrate the feasibility of international repository interoperability. Experimentation has begun to leverage Linked Open Data services to facilitate discovery and use of digitized emblem resources. This paper reports on progress to date and describes next steps in leveraging Linked Open Data to improve the utility of the OpenEmblem Portal for research and pedagogy. This work serves as an adaptable case study for the implementation of Linked Open Data in a digital humanities context.
