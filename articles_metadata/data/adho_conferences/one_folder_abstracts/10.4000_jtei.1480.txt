The debate on the semantic role of markup languages has been quite lively and the TEI community has played an active part in it. It is commonly acknowledged that markup conveys semantic information. However, XML is a poor language for semantic data modeling. Several proposals have previously been drawn up in the past to provide XML with formalized and computable semantics. In our opinion, the formalisms offered by the Semantic Web paradigm are mature enough to build a workable semantic extension of the TEI.
