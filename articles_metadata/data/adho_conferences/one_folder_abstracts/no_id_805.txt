Memoragram is a service that stores, classify and show remembrances of one of the longest, most violent passages of peruvian history: the armed conflict between terrorist organizations Shining Path and MRTA and the peruvian government. Users can explore historic events by geo-location, time, venues, people, organizations and theme related media. Also they would be able to leave their own memories using text, audio, photos and even video in order to leave messages to future generations. There's a working prototype at http://arenalabs.pe and a mobile augmented reality experience using Junaio app; screenshots available at http://bit.ly/U2fayr
