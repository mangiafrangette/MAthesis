This article interrogates tensions in Digital Humanities (DH) and calls for critical introspection of our practices. Arguing that digital humanities (dh) has become a site of struggle for the future of the academy, the essay rejects a monolithic understanding of dh, arguing that such a representation encourages tensions by hiding the varying disciplinary knowledge productions, national structures, and local contexts that form specific dh practices. Insisting on specificity as a counter narrative to that of the sweeping representation of DH's revolutionary change, the article suggests that the current analysis of dh as a battle between insiders and outsiders is a potentially destructive form of resistance. Attending to continued problems with the treatment of race and gender in the field, the essay argues that such issues are core to particular dh practices.
