This paper presents the results of the Modernist Versions Project’s (MVP) survey of existing tools for digital collation and comparison of texts. The MVP’s primary mission is to enable new critical insights that are difficult without digital or computational approaches. We begin by understanding “versioning” as the process through which scholars examine multiple “witnesses” of a text in order to gain critical insight into its creation and transmission. Moreover, we need to compare both textual and conceptual variants identified by editors. Before building its own tool, the MVP surveyed and assessed an array of existing tools, including the following: Juxta, oXygen, CollateX, nMerge, Git, TEI-Comparator, DiffDog, ExamDiff, XMLStarlet, Versioning Machine, XMLUnit, and XOM. This paper presents the methodologies of the survey and assessment, the MVP’s findings, and the conclusions it has drawn.
