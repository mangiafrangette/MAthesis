This paper will discuss Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and its application in the humanities, with special focus on questions of concern to literary history. In the fields of ecology, economics, and political science, ABM has been used to show how the behaviors of individual entities collectively alter large emergent phenomena. ABM offers a promising new way to approach long-standing humanistic questions, such as how literary genres change over time, how publics form and transform, or how consumer markets influence authors.
