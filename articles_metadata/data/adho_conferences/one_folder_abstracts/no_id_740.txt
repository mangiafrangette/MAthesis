Along with online data about historical sources and places, Structured prosopography provides a powerful impetus for open and linked data for historians. However, for various good reasons, different teams doing prosopographical work have taken different approaches to the creation of their data. In the same way that CIDOC-CRM has been developed to allow connections between different cultural heritage data collections to be made, an Ontology for Historical Persons would allow prosopographical information from different projects to connect more effectively. In this presentation, I would present our current thoughts on the subject, and start a conversation with other projects with an interest in shared, structured, prosopographical data.
