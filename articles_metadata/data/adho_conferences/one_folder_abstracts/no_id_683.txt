One barrier to locating serialized fiction in a digital newspaper collection is the fact that the serials themselves are not indexed, and individual articles do not have metadata or tags associated with them that would identify them as fiction. As a result, specific article types are difficult to find unless the reader browses or simply hits upon a salutary keyword search. Finding the next installment is also a manual process, and there are always problems with the OCR quality. This paper will present the results of a research study which mined the University of Illinois' digital newspaper collection for serialized fiction and evaluated multiple software approaches for solving these problems by traditional indexing and tagging, crowdsourcing to correct OCR problems, and automating the process with text analysis.
