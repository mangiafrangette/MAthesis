Citation analysis is a well-known metric to measure scientific impact and has helped in highlighting significant work. However, citations suffer from delays that could span months and years. We used data from Social reference management (SRM)with focus on Digital Humanities. We propose a new metric based on SRM: Research Community Article Rating (RCAR)and compare it with citations and readerships. We used another metric based on the social web for analyzing scholarship, compare it with citation analysis and report the results.
