Our project seeks to uncover formal and semantic artifacts of poetic tropes within eighteenth-century literature. It is our contention that the specific, trope-based genres of eighteenth-century poetic satire and allegory operate within the mediation of specific semantic fields by the formal constraints of poetic diction. Using a multi-pronged approach, that combines frequency analysis and topic modeling with an automated recognition of poetic form (including meter and rhyme scheme), we seek to test our ability to computationally identify figurative language at the level of genre within a corpus of eighteenth-century poems (~1500). This project not only expands our definition of the "context" that is necessary to identify satiric or allegoric writing (replacing knowledge of specific socio-cultural phenomenon with knowledge of form) but also serves as a pilot study into the possibility of automating the recognition of figurative language and thereby opening the field of poetry for analysis by the Digital Humanities.
