The proposed paper details the process of the Medieval Electronic Scholarly Alliance (MESA) to modify the existing metadata specifications used by NINES and 18thConnect to be used by the medieval studies. We have been successful in writing useful and usable requirements, while respecting the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC), the umbrella organization that supports MESA, NINES, 18thConnect, and the other ARC "nodes".
