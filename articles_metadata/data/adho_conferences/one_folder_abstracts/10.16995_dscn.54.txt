As Daniel O'Donnell's review of global participation in digital humanities suggests, digital activity may be correlated with the economic situation of a country, such that countries with high income witness a high participation in digital activities while countries with average or low income have partial or low participation (2012). Therefore, in this paper, I investigate the digital culture of Nigeria as a developing country with the goal of teasing out explanations for the gaps between digital literacy and digital humanities activities. I focus on the reasons for a low participation in digital humanities activities in the country by looking into the problems that internet users face in the country and why, despite the amount of digital activities taking place in the country, there appears to be an absence of digital humanities in academia. I conclude by proposing ways through which digital humanities can be incorporated into the Nigerian digital culture, especially in the education sector.
