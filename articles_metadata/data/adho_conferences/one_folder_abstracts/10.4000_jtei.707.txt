This paper introduces the digital edition Letters and Texts: Intellectual Berlin around 1800, which is being developed by the junior research group "Berlin Intellectuals 1800â€“1830" at the Institute for German Literature of the Humboldt University in Berlin. The aim of the edition is to shed new light on literary and intellectual networks in the Prussian capital city around 1800 by making accessible valuable letters, manuscripts, and other documents that have been neglected by researchers. The focus is on writers, scholars, and publishers who contributed to the intense intellectual activity in Berlin around 1800 and whose edited texts afford the reader with a deeper knowledge of their writings as well as their position within the intellectual community of their time.
