This paper (with slides) is drawn from a book in progress (under contract at Routledge) about an important cultural context for the digital humanities, the eversion of cyberspace. It argues that the emergence of DH in its newly prominent forms during the past decade is closely connected to this larger shift in the collective imagination of the network. This context helps us understand the public role that DH might play in exploring multiple connections between digital and physical materialities out in the world. After summarizing he eversion and connected developments in DH, in conclusion Iâ€™ll suggest that games offer ways to think about the active role of DH in the ongoing eversion of the network, and about the engagement of humanities research with developments in the wider world.
