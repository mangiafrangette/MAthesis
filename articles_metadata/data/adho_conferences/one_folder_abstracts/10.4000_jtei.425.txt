Croatiae auctores Latini (CroALa), a text collection first published in 2009, makes freely accessible Latin texts written by or about people of Croatian origin from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. The collection is intended primarily for scholars of Latin and neo-Latin literature and language and of Croatian history and culture. Texts are encoded in TEI XML and made searchable and readable online using PhiloLogic.
