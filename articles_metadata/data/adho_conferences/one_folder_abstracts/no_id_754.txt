At present, it is unusual for researchers in Humanities and Social Sciences to have access to interrelated infrastructures offering large data sets so arranged and encoded to allow easy comparative research as well as to encourage the online publication of its results for scholarly and learning purposes. Our paper concerns the development and achievement of the European project Agora: Scholarly Open Access Research in European Philosophy – http://www.project-agora.eu –. This project aims at improving the spread of European research results in the field of philosophy, while advancing new paradigms of Open Access (OA) publishing, peer-reviewing, and rendering thanks to the interlinking, connecting, and commenting of digital versions of primary sources (manuscripts, original printed editions, critical editions) and secondary literature (articles, monographs, audio and video contributions).
