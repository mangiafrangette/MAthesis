LEXUS is a flexible web-based lexicon tool tailored for documenting endangered languages but can be used as a lexicographical tool for any other language. LEXUS does not enforce any pre-described schema structure to the user, however it supports the creation of lexicon within the structure of the proposed ISO-LMF standard and promotes the usage of concept names proposed by the ISO data categories. LEXUS has distinct possibilities for visualization. Its support for multimedia allows for local or archived images/movie clips to be attached to different elements of a lexical entry. Its support for customizable views allows for different ways of styling lexicon. Finally LEXUS allows shared access to a given lexicon, suitable for collaboration among researchers as it facilitates concurrent work on a given language by allowing multiple users access to the lexicon. These features make LEXUS a promising online shared-access multimedia encyclopedic lexicon tool for language documentation projects.
