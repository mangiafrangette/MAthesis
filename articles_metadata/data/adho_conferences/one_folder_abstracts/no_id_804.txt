This paper will review the structure and development philosophy of Heurist, a database abstraction which hides the complexity of richly structured databases from the end-user, allowing them to build complex databases without programmer assistance. It will address the opposition between serendipitous development by scholar-programmers and structured development by software engineers, using two mobile applications developed within Heurist as case studies. I argue that serendipitous development is important at both levels â€” in the development of databases as in the development of the software. The paper aims to stimulate debate on software development methodologies and the role of the scholar-programmer.
