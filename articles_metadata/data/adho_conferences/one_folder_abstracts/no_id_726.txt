The aim of the Australian Electronic Scholarly Editing Project (AustESE) is to develop a set of interoperable services to support the production of electronic scholarly editions by distributed collaborators in a Web 2.0 environment. One of the fundamental challenges faced by the project is the development of an interoperable data model. In this paper we describe the projectâ€™s overall objectives and the ontology that we are using to support the AustESE Workbench. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of an integrated workbench as it relates to several case studies.
