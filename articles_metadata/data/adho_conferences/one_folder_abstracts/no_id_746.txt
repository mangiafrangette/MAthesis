Digital Humanities(DH) has been exhaustively defined in the literature whereas a thorough investigation and description of the communicative practices of DH is lacking. This paper examines informal and formal communication channels used by members of the DH community to diffuse information and build communities. We analyze data from these communications to determine how these interactions connect DH community members at the individual, group, and institutional levels and across the DH landscape and helps answer the question: How does the socio-technical ecology connect or partition the landscape of the DH community? This work will apply multi-dimensional network analysis to data from Twitter, LLC and DHQ journals, DH-related NEH grants awards, the TEI-L and Humanist listservs, DH syllabi, and other sources, to paint a wider view of the connections among people, teams, institutions, and communication channels that make up the DH landscape.
