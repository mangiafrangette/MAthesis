A study of the use, distribution, and evolution of geographic space in nineteenth-century American fiction. Source corpus includes 1,098 novel-like volumes from the period 1851-8175, processed using Stanford CoreNLP entity extraction and Google geocoding API, with geographic output mapped in R. Results indicate close correlations between population and literary attention, as well as distributions of place name uses that complicate existing literary-critical understandings of the American Renaissance and the development of literary regionalism after the Civil War. The modest magnitude of changes in geographic attention after the war suggest important revisions to literary and historic conceptions of "revolutionary" change. Some additional consideration of demographic and economic factors beyond population distribution that may influence literary-geographic attention over time, as well as of the time scales on which these factors interact.
