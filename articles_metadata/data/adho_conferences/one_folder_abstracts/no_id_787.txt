Arthur Schnitzler: Digitale Historisch-Kritische Edition is a long-term project founded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften with a runtime of 18 years. The aim is to create a digital historical-critical edition of both the works published during Schnitzler's lifetime and his literary estate. As an integrated hybrid edition, it will provide scholars with an up-to-date, philologically dependable textual basis. To this end, the team of editors at Bergische Universität Wuppertal closely cooperates with computer scientists at Trier Center for Digital Humanities who are developing a customized virtual research environment. Based upon a unified data model, it will support all editorial steps from entering the meta data through transcribing the textual witnesses to preparing the online and print publication. This paper shall outline the philological challenges of the project and show how the projected platform is to meet them.
