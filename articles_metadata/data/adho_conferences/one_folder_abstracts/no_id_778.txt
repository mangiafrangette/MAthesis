While visualization is an indisputably important aspect of data modeling in the humanities, the static nature of most data model visualizations results paradoxically in the creation of a barrier to research exploration as well as an aid. We present here a tool for interactive modeling, manipulation, and alteration of a text variant graph model, as produced by the current generation of text collation tools. Our tool, written in Javascript for direct use in the browser, can be adapted to any humanities problem domain that can be expressed in sequence variation. We see the tool as an important example and precedent for eliminating the problematic authority (whether intentional or not) that often accompanies computer-generated models.
