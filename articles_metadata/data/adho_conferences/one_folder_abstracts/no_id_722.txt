We combine two approaches to literary analysis (that of a computer scientist with a bag-of-words model and that of a literary scholar examining plot structure and character interactions) to analyze movies and plays. We extract and build character interaction networks in the form of weighted graphs from a database of scripts, compute various informative properties from the resulting networks (e.g. clustering coefficient), and construct logistic regression and decision tree classifiers based on these properties that distinguish between a multitude of characteristics that define movies and plays, such as media type, publication date, and genre. Finally, we discuss the successes and failures of using automated classification for specific characteristics on such limited input and strive to formulate intuitive explanations of the results.
