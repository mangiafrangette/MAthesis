In Computational Linguistics, language identification of text is generally considered a solved problem—but these methods assume that a text is monolingual, and at least 100 characters long. However, such methods cannot be used for multilingual texts in which the author switches between languages within a sentence, as in the “Chymistry of Isaac Newton”, a collection of writings on alchemy by Newton. In these documents, Newton often switches between English, Latin, and French, even within sentences. For this reason, we have developed a new method for automatically identifying the language for single words rather than for complete texts.
