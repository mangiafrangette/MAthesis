Researchers are taking theses and dissertations, geoparsing those texts, and creating a visual, map-based search interface in order to glean better understanding of the locations and topics presented in these scholarly works. The ETDMap is a prototype which automatically discerns the places mentioned in digital documents(i.e. geoparsing) and through a series of automated steps creates a map to browse the collection.
