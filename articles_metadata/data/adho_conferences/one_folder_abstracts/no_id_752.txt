Data modeling is one of the main tasks of digital humanists. They engage in it creating databases, corpora, digital editions, geographical information systems, research collections, digital libraries, project-specific markup and also crosswalks for heterogenous data collections. In light of this variety of activities it is interesting to note that there is no general theory of data modeling in the digital humanities. This paper seeks to ask, in a very preliminary way, what ideas could be part of a first outline of a general theory of data modeling in the humanities.
