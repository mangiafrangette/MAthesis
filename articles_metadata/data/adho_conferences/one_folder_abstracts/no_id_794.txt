This paper describes two problems that arise in making suitable XQuery-based search interfaces available for these materials, and outlines our work to date on solving them: (1) how to provide not only simple search interfaces for casual searchers but more powerful open-ended interfaces for specialist searches, and (2) how to use XQuery to full advantage in searches that involve patterns across sequences of sibling nodes (and not just the hierarchical relations which XML systems find easy to handle).
