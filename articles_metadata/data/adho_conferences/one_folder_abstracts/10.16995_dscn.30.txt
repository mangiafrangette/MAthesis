In this paper, we will explore certain points of intersection between digital text and literary text, without limiting our analysis to “digital literature.” Instead, we will adopt an intermedial approach to our investigation to identify productive dialectic avenues for reflection. This paper will therefore outline how establishing a relationship between digital and literary text leads us to reconsider the mediality of literary text and what this reconceptualization of text shows us in terms of parallels between digital and literary text, in particular with regard to movement production. The novel, Océan mer (OM), by Alessandro Baricco (1998), will be used to illustrate our view.
