This paper will present the findings from a PhD Case study into the use and users of the British Library Nineteenth Century Newspapers collection (BNCN) , and demonstrate that, instead of providing universal access, subscription-based digitized collections in fact mimic and reinforce the existing digital divide. Using data gathered from web analytics and user surveys, it will show that, although digitization has clearly benefitted users who operate in an information-rich environment, these benefits do not extend evenly across society, or even academia. As a result, I have created an alternative geographical visualization to demonstrate this problem, based upon the location of subscribing institutions rather than individual users. In combination, these will back up the main argument of this paper: that the subscription-based model of digitization does not ensure universal access to valuable content, but instead reinforces the divide between information-rich and information-poor communities.
