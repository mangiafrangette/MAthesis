The modern digital edition is a collection of text and facsimile images of sources. But what we lack currently are better ways to integrate these forms of digital surrogate. Image-based electronic editions were proposed some years ago as a way to link sections of images to sections of corresponding text. The AustESE (Australian electronic scholarly editing) project aims - among other things - to develop interoperable tools for viewing, editing and storing such links in a reusable and shareable way. The TILT tool is a Java applet that can create text-image links and automate the process on several levels: by auto-recognising lines and words on print and manuscript pages even when they are tilted or wavy, and by auto-selecting the corresponding text simultaneously. This would enable the rapid creation of text-image link data and make image-based electronic editions more practical.
