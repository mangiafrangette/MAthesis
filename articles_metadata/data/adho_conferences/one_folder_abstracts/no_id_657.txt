This paper deals with "Rolling Delta", a method of identifying collaborators in a literary work based on a comparison of the frequencies of most frequent words between the collaborative work in question and several individual works by each of the collaborators. This method is then applied to analyze works written jointly by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford.
