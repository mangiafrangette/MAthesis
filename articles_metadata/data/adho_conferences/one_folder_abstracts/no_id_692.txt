Incorporating ways of conveying the notions of uncertainty and imprecision within visualizations is a critical issue. Depicting uncertainty has been the object of study of many scholars, however, its application to cultural heritage visualizations, whose shapes are dictated by those of the objects being represented, poses particular issues and constraints. This is even more problematic in the case of automatically generated visualizations. This presentation will address this problem and consider what possible steps can be taken to depict uncertainty and imprecision within automated visualizations of bookbinding structures. This presentation is intended to serve as an example of the kind of perceptually salient graphical variables that can be used to successfully depict uncertainty and imprecision within cultural heritage prototypical diagrams.
