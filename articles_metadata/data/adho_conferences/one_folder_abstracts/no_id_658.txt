This project employs digital storytelling to investigate the processes and impacts of academic migration. During the 2012-2013 academic year, international faculty members and Kazakh students at the newly opened Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan have the opportunity to contribute personal narratives of academic migration to a database. The ensemble of narratives explores how personal experiences of migration overlap and/or vary, and how migration impacts teaching and learning on trans/national scales. Putting first-hand accounts into dialogue with research on academic migration and migration more generally, the project’s designer asks: How does the collection of digital narratives from the Nazarbayev University campus community contribute to current research on migration? What do the narratives reveal about the formation of individual and national identities in an era of increased migration and information technology? And, how does the project’s digital storytelling platform promote transnational discussion, thereby impacting trends in higher education?
