The study of narrative is an essential part of understanding not only literature, but its appeal. So far, machine analysis of plot has been based on either mark-up based systems or formal models of plot, both of which rely extensively on models or experience found outside the corpus under review. This paper presents a new approach that learns the structure and details of plot directly from the corpus itself in an unsupervised fashion. This technique, adapted from stylometry, is demonstrated with a corpus of romance novels, showing that while the genre is somewhat formulaic, several discrete narrative strategies emerge as important - showing the genre is, in fact, composed of several formulas. This novel approach to observing, rather than preconceiving, plot structure opens a new horizon for stylometric tools.
