I have initiated the NSF-supported (NSF CAREER Award # 1064495) Advanced Identity Representation (AIR) project to develop theory and technology for expressive and empowering self-representations (profiles, player characters, avatars) in social networks, games, and related technologies. Here, I report on development processes and pedagogy informing new theory and technology, a platforms called the AIR Toolkit and a critical pedagogy game built with it called Mimesis that increases awareness of covert forms of social discrimination. This work has emerged from from integrated research and pedagogy aims that are based upon an integrated sociology and cognitive science framework for classification/categorization and present early results with applications to computer gaming and educational software (with foci upon critique of disempowering social identity constructions). As I develop theory and platforms, those are then used in the classroom resulting in new projects each term that have been accepted into peer-reviewed conferences with students and co-authors.
