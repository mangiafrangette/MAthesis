With the aim of opening up a digital archive developed for researchers in illuminated manuscripts, we carried out a task-oriented evaluation with members of the general public. The main results regard the difficulties to involve non specialist in using targeted cultural heritage collections, which are likely due to a marginal interest towards the collection content. On the other hand, users showed a higher interest towards the research activities carried out on the digital content, including all the research process (sources, measurements, analyses). Thus we propose a shift in the focus of systems for managing cultural heritage digital collections: from tools for disseminating cultural content to tools for involving general users in goals, methods and results of scientific research on the cultural content.
