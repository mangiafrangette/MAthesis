This paper introduces a new ecology of learning and innovative connections between ecological and a humanities curriculum. Drawing on points of intersection between experiential liberal arts education, digital humanities, biomimicry, and ecopsychology, this session will engage instructors and administrators in course development strategies and in helping students plan their own learning by using a DH-supported systems approach to curriculum design. The presentation will explore questions including (1) how can ecological thinking provide a model for a more intentional and dynamic liberal arts pedagogy? (2) can digital technologies help us develop more ecologically-focused learning environments and curricula? and (3) how can teachers integrate ecological thinking into new and existing courses, units, and overall curriculum design?
