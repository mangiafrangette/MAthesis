Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) is one of the most influential female authors of the Middle Ages. From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to her is fascinating, because of the complex authorship underlying it. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language which she did not completely master. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. The extent to which these 'copyeditors' have interfered with Hildegardâ€™s style has been the subject of intense debate. In this paper we will quantitatively assess whether Hildegard's oeuvre is still a stylistically coherent corpus, distinguishable from that of contemporary authors, in particular her last secretary, Guibert of Gembloux. This paper carries wider relevance for stylometry: stylometrists typically focus on high-frequency function words, carrying only grammatical meanings. In the case of Hildegard, it were exactly these grammatical words that were often corrected by her scribes.
