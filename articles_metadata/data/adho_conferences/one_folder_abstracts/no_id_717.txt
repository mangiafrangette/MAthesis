Renear (2000) introduces the term "transcriptional markup" with a general and loose sense of pertaining to the reproduction of an existing text, and he does not attempt to define transcription per se. In recent years Huitfeldt and Sperberg-McQueen (2008), and Huitfeldt, Marcoux, and Sperberg-McQueen (2009, 2010) have developed a model of transcription (hereafter the HMS model) that they believe "provides a sort of greatest common denominator for markup systems" (2010, p. 15). But an awkward gap exists between the HMS model's abstract components and the realities of, for example, the TEI markup language and its typical usage. Here I make the case for a kind of markup — perfectly possible though in practice improbable — which bridges that gap. I call it pure transcriptional markup because it refines the sense of Renear's term and grounds it in an actual, formally specified model of transcription.
