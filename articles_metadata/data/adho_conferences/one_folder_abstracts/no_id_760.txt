In this research, we will create authoritative information related to historical personal names, put it to use toward Digital Cultural Heritage in which old photographs are stored, and use it to analyze the interrelationships of the family members who are the subjects of these photographs. Specifically, we will attach personal name data provided by authoritative personal name information to the iconographic parts of people featured in old photographs. Then, for these photos, we will interpret that “the higher level of frequency with which certain members appear together in group photographs, the stronger the interrelationship between the members”, and will analyze the network relationship of the ties between each member. We will then compare the data by decade and generation, thereby clarifying the transitions in personal networks between family members.
