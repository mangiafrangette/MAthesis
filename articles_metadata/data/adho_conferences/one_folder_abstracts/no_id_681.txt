This paper considers the role of amateur projects of literary texts which are still protected under copyright. This paper demonstrates that although many literary texts published post-1922 are not deeply embedded within the Digital Humanities tradition due to their copyright status, these texts have a clear future as an object of study in the Digital Humanities. These amateur projects start without funding or faculty blessing and are thus free to explore the possibilities of connecting with these texts. The variety of amateur approaches and their usefulness reveals the need for careful decisions of how to interface with these print texts rather than rushing in to the most obvious approach.
