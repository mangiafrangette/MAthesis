This paper is concerned with stylometric classification applied to French seventeenth-century plays. It reports on ongoing investigations into parameter setting and its impact on classification of such texts by author, genre, or form, using Eder & Rybicky's stylometric scripts for R. Based on an investigation into the Corneille-Moli√®re controversy, several methodological issues standing in the way of reliable results have been identified. One issue concerns the degree to which such authorship classification tasks are influenced by genre (here, comedy or tragedy) and form (here, verse or prose). Investigations into this issue show that input parameters have indeed systematic effects on the relative influence of authorship, genre and form in the classification of plays. Being able to take such effects into account may increase the reliability of authorship attribution results.
