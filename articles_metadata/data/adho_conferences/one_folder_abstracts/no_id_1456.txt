 Entity-based Topic Modeling PipelineThe whole source code is available for public download on Github. Given a working Python, Java, and Scala runtime as well as a running MySQL installation our pipeline is ready directly out-of-the-box. The specific configuration according to the user's needs can be made via a simple text file. Three-Step Evaluation Platform Document LabelsIn order to assess the quality of the detected entities as labels we developed a specific browser-based evaluation platform, which permits manual annotations. This platform presents a document on the right of the screen and a set of possible labels on the left (See Figure 2). Annotators are asked to pick labels that precisely describe the content of each document. In case the annotator does not select any label, this is also recorded by our evaluation system. Entities and Topic WordsIn order to establish if the selected entities were the right labels for the topics produced, we developed two additional evaluation steps. Inspired by the topic intrusion task (Chang et al, 2009), we designed a platform that permits to evaluate the relations between labels and topics using two evaluation modes: For one evaluation mode (that we called Label Mode - Figure  3), the annotator is asked to choose, when possible, the correct list of topic-words given a label. For the other, he/she was asked to pick the right label given a list of topic words (aee Figure 4). In both cases, the annotator is shown three options: one of them is the correct match, while the other two (be they words or labels) come from other topics related to the same document.
