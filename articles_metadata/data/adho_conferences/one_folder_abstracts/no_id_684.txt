Agents for Actors (AfA, https://github.com/mwkuster/agents-for-actors) is an Open Source DH framework for distributed microservices for text linking and visualization. It identifies allusions between XML texts and their supposed sources using a double NGram algorithm. Results are provenanced using XPointers. AfA is written in the functional language Clojure and builds on purely functional data structures. It heavily parallelizes computations, using agents for asynchronous processing. Per default AfA stores its results in an XML linking file and uses Neo4j for the visualization of networks of intertextuality, but other visualization components and comparison algorithms can be plugged in. The findings are exemplified by a passage from Atkinson's Black Adder and its links to its Shakespearean sources.
