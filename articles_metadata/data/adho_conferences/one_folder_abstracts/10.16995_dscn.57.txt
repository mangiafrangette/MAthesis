The Papers of George Washington Financial Series is a born-digital project that will publish all of Washington’s financial records – a total of several thousand distinct documents. These are not only numerous, but very diverse and complicated documents, including receipts, invoices, day books, and double entry ledgers that each comprise thousands of discrete transactions. These documents record in depth and in detail every aspect of Washington’s business enterprises, from the account books detailing activities at Mount Vernon and his farms to the books he kept while away at war and during his presidency. This article briefly examines some of the major issues faced in early project development and how they were handled in our content management system, DocTracker.
