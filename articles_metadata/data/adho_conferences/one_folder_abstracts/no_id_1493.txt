 The project Mapping the Enlightenment: Intellectual Networks and the Making of Knowledge in the European Periphery is funded by the Research Centre for Humanities (RCH) for the academic year 2016-2017. The project uses interactive mapping tools for visualising, exploring, and analysing the intellectual and geographical networks developed by Greek-speaking scholars of the Ottoman Empire during the 17 th and 18 th centuries.
