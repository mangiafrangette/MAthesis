Compilations of biographies of women — first as historical figures, later as learned women, and then as writers with bibliographies and selections — contain rich national and transnational narratives that allow us to re-envision women’s literary history from the manuscript to the digital age. This project situates digital scholarship on women in a long historical, international continuum as it traces the development over the past 600 years of a coherent yet dynamic genre that began with Boccaccio’s Famous Women and gradually spread throughout Europe and the U.S.
