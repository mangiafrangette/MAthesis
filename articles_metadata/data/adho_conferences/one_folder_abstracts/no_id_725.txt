INKE’s Modelling and Prototyping group is currently motivated by the following research questions: How do we model and enable context within the electronic scholarly edition? How do we engage knowledge-building communities and capture process, dialogue and connections in and around the electronic scholarly edition? NewRadial is a prototype scholarly edition environment developed to address such queries. However, its unification of primary texts, secondary scholarship and related knowledge communities, and its re-presentation of the digital scholarly edition as a social edition, an open work and a shared space where users collaboratively explore, sort, group, annotate and contribute to secondary scholarship creation, makes it both a model and prototype for alternative ways of working with and contributing to data-centric humanities research online. Its unique lens — through which a diverse collection of digital humanities objects can be re-imagined, freely explored and iteratively prototyped — is also an argument advocating for evolutions in humanities theory and praxis.
