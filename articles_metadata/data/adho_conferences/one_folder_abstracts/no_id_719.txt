The annotation tool ELAN allows for adding time-linked textual annotations to digital audio and video recordings. It is applied in various disciplines within the humanities, with linguistics, sign language and gesture research represented most prominently in its user base. This paper highlights new developments in ELAN with an emphasis on those features that introduced new technological and methodological approaches to analysing both audio/video and derived textual data. We focus on improvements to the workflow of researchers as a result of the introduction of task oriented modes and on how the scope of the program has been expanded by implementing a framework for computational annotation creation modules and by connecting to web services that apply computational techniques for the same purpose.
