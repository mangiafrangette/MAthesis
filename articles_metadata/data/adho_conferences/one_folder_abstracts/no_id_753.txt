This paper will advocate that digital scholarly editions should follow five guiding principles, briefly: 1. The text of both the document and of the work should be encoded; 2. All editorial acts should be attributed; 3. All materials should, by default, be available by a Creative Commons share-alike license; 4. All materials should be available independent of any one interface; 5. All materials should be held in a sustainable long-term storage system, such as an institutional repository. No editions made so far appear to follow all five principles; and many satisfy not even one of these principles. The reasons for the distance between existing digital editions and these principles may provoke useful debate.
