Writing is a process that occurs in time. This simple and obvious consideration involves many issues both from a theoretical and practical point of view. A critical evaluation of timing is really crucial in the case of modern authors' autograph draft manuscripts because different layers of corrections, deletions and additions can give insight into an author’s way of working, key to the interpretations of his/her works and the evolution of the author’s Weltanschaung, as highlighted in genetic criticism over the last few years.The question is too complex just to try to give some basic references; anyway Gresillon 1994 will offer a good starting point. Medieval manuscripts copied by one ore more scribes are also, of course, the result of a process that occurred in time, but the different kind of authorship involved in such cases seems to involve a difference in the evaluation of the cultural weight of recorded variants. When a scholar inspects a written text, especially a manuscript, s/he has in his/her hands the final result of that process and can choose whether to approach it from a codicological/documentary point of view, “photographing” the resulting product, or from a genetic point of view, trying to describe the teleological flow of authoring. The first approach is more typical of scribes’ copies, the latter of autographic (draft) manuscripts.Practically, time based editions are really difficult to represent in printed works, because of the bi-dimensionality of paper sheets.On voudrait représenter dans la bidimensionalité des pages un processus génétique dont on s’est pourtant appliqué à montrer que sa proprieté est d’ajouter à l’écrit, qui est bidimensionel, une troisième dimension, qui est celle du temps!Gresillon 1994:121In a digital framework bi-dimensionality can be overruled by a hypertextual/multimedia approach that can allow the creation of a more flexible context for the presentation of a genetic edition. The problem of a time based encoding has been discussed in several circumstances (i.e. TEI Manuscripts SIG Meeting Report 01, Vanhoutte 2002 that suggests the usage of the markup solution employed in the transcription of speech for the purpose), but – up till now – a coherent encoding model for such editions has not been proposed. And for a good reasons: while it is possible to describe a relative-timed process, it is very complicated, if not impossible, to draw a general absolute-timed framework.Analysis and time-based encoding of authorial interventionsLet us consider a couple of examples taken from page 3595 of Zibaldone of Giacomo Leopardi.Ex. 1 line 6paper_172_pierazzo_1.jpgFig. 1paper_172_pierazzo_2.jpgIn this line we can detect two corrections: 1) deletion of the line under “si” and 2) deletion of “dotti” corrected into “denti”.We can try to draw the timing of the creation of the segment as follow:Time 1: writing “che e’ si rechi a dotti”Time 2: deletion of “dotti”; consequent writing of “denti”Time 3: underlying of “si”Time 4: deletion of the line under “si”Time 5: underlying of “rechi” and “denti”Time 6: writing of “l’un d’essi cibi”Other timetables are also possible, but let’s assume this is the more probable one. The text can be encoded using a TEI-based mark-up with the help of a new global attribute (@time), intending that it’s just an example to help the conceptualization of the problem:  <seg time="1">che e' <del type="underline deletion" time="4"> <hi rend="underline" time="3">si</hi>> </del> <hi rend="underline" time="5">rechi a'</hi> <del type="overstrike" time="2">dotti</del> </seg>> <seg time="2"> <hi rend="underline" time="5">denti</hi> </seg> <seg time="6">l'un d'essi cibi</seg>Such transcription tries to model the real flow of writing, but such a model may not be workable. In fact, it will fragment the flow of the plain writing in potentially infinite pieces. To simplify it, we can assume as Time 0 (default) the time of the normal plain writing flow, timing just editorial interventions.The schedule will then be modified as follows:Time 0: writing “che e’ si rechi a dotti”Time 1: deletion of : “dotti”Time 0: writing of “denti”Time 2: underlying of “si”Time 3: deletion of the underline under “si”Time 4: underlying of “rechi” and “denti”Time 0: writing of “l’un d’essi cibi”A further simplification is also possible: assuming that – in genetic criticism terms – so-called “writing variant” (deletion of a single word substituted by another that immediately follows on the same line) occurs during the normal writing flow, the following model can be drawn:Time 0: writing “che si rechi a dotti”; deletion of : “dotti”; writing of “denti”; writing of “l’un d’essi cibi”Time 1: underlying of “si”Time 2: deletion of the underline under “si”Time 3: underlying of “rechi” and “denti”This will be the consequent new encoding: che e' <del type="underline deletion" time="2"> <hi rend="underline" time="1">si</hi></del> <hi rend="underline" time="3">rechi a'</hi> <del type="overstrike">dotti</del> <hi rend="underline" time="3">denti</hi> l'un d'essi cibiThe last possibility should not imply that any inline correction is to be considered as done in Time 0, but just the one followed by the correction. In fact, in the case of a deletion of an adjective or of any other word not essential from a syntactical point of view, the correction can occur in any time.Ex. 2 line 11paper_172_pierazzo_3.jpgFig. 2paper_172_pierazzo_4.jpgThis passage can be timed as follow:Time 1: writing “che di due Eroi a”;Time 2: deletion of “a”;Time 3: writing of “quanto si voglia pari di”Time 4: interlinear addition of “o più” after “Eroi”Time 5: deletion of the additionTime 6: interlinear addition of “o più” after “due”Or, in the simplified version, as follow:Time 0: writing of “che di due Eroi a”; deletion of “a”; writing of “quanto si voglia pari di”Time 1: interlinear addition of “o più” after “Eroi”Time 2: deletion of the additionTime 3: interlinear addition of “o più” after “due”The encoding model (simplified version): che di due <add place="intralinear" time="3">o più</add> Eroi <del type="overstrike">a</del> <del type="overstrike" time="2"><add place="intralinear" time="1">o più</add></del> quanto si voglia pari di By applying different stylesheets to the encoded texts, it will be possible to show all the different stages and to give the user the possibility of browsing among them.paper_172_pierazzo_5.jpgRelative or absolute?The two above examples occur on the same page: shall we then consider Time 1 of the first example the same of Time 1 of the second example? The answer should be: no; very little can be said about the timing of editorial/authorial intervention in two different segments. The possibility of establishing an absolute timing for correction is applicable only where we have strong palaeographic evidences or authorial declarations dating or describing a revision.For instance, we can imagine an author used to typewrite his/her texts and then to correct them by hand: in this case the assumption of an absolute time is possible. But as different layers of hand corrections can also occur, there will be, in this case also, the necessity of considering relative-timed interventions. This situation can be represented in encoding distinguishing absolute and relative timing for instance by the application of two different attributes, i.e. @timeRel and @timeAbs In a digital framework an incorrect consideration of time as absolute or relative can bring to display texts that never existed. Let us imagine for a moment that we build an XSLT based tool able to display at a time either Time 1, Time 2 or Time 3 etc. variants: the results would be the display of variants that might have lived in different moments. I think that, in absence of explicit authorial declarations or of palaeographic evidence, the only possible display would be to show timing of variants segment by segment, i.e. to give evidence just of relative timed corrections.In the presentation I will present some examples from different authors (Giacomo Leopardi, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf and some others) to examine the complexity of representation of temporal factors in digital genetic editions.
