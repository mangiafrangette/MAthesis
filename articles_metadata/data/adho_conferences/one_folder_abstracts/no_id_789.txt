Six Degrees of Francis Bacon (SDFB) is a digital reconstruction of the early modern social network (EMSN) that scholars and students from all over the world will be able to collaboratively expand, revise, curate, and critique. The primary motivation for the creation of SDFB is to make possible a new way to reconstruct, represent, and study the complex relations between authors, texts, publishers, and readers in the early modern period. It combines computational and statistical methods, which can explore the relationships of thousands of historical figures using hundreds of thousands of source documents, with the local expertise of a growing number of humanities scholars.
