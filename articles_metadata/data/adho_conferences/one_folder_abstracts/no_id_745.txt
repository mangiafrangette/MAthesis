Editorsâ€™ Notes is a platform for writing, organizing, and linking of working research notes, which are relevant to source documents but not necessarily tied to any specific document, and which may or may not become a formal finished product. It has been iteratively developed and in use over the past two years by teams of documentary editors at the Emma Goldman Papers, the Margaret Sanger Papers, and the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers, and by curators of the the Joseph A. Labadie Collection of radical history. Our experiences building and using Editors' Notes illustrate both the challenges and potential of "open notebook humanities." We report on the design and implementation of the platform, how it has been used so far, and plans for future development.
