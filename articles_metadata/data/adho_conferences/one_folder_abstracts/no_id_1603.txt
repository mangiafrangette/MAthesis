UMass Amherst, United States of America In the concluding days of the 2016 session of the NEH Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities Summer Institute on Advanced Challenges in Theory and Practice in 3D Modeling of Cultural Heritage Sites held at UCLA, participants, faculty, and invited scholars fo-cused discussion on the critical issues facing academics working with 3D content. The goal of these conversations were threefold: 1) to clearly articulate the challenges facing researchers integrating 3D tools and methods into their scholarship, 2) to outline key questions and new lines of inquiry for future investigation, and 3) to develop actionable recommendations to position 3D work as a valid-and viable-mode of knowledge production. This paper describes that process , the topics chosen for discussion, and the resultant list of action items for the 3D community.
