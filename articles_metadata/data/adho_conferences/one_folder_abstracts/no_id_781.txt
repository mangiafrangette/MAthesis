This paper aims to focus on "Yorozu no fumihougu" as the collection of posthumous works in Ukiyozoushi (realistic literature) written by Saikaku Ihara (1642？～1693) as a historic classical document of the Japanese cultural foundation and then examine the Authorship problem for Saikaku's works from a viewpoint of statistical science. In this study, we use the database with 578,617 words $2 as being processed for morphological analysis to all sentences of Saikaku's 24 works on the basis of "Shinpen Saikaku Zenshu". This database was developed in cooperation with the editor of "Yorozu no fumihougu " at the affiliate laboratory. The database is the only database to be able to analyze Saikaku's works at present and has a high degree of reliability from a viewpoint of Japanese language and literature. The analysis uses an appearance ratio of word class as a basic data.
