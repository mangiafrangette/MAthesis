The humanities are undergoing profound shifts in the nature of the processes used to produce scholarly work. As this migration to digital practices is increasingly accepted at universities and public institutions, such bodies have realised they must develop consistent policies governing the practice, implementation, and evaluation of digital scholarship. The formal debate about these processes in relation to faculty and administration is well underway. Similar discussions from the perspective of graduate students working on large-scale, collaborative digital projects has until now been limited to passing conversations at conferences and intradepartmental gestures, with occasional online discussions occurring in venues frequented by early career digital practitioners. This contribution revisits and rehearses, in textual form, issues raised and discussions had at a roundtable at the 2012 conference of the Canadian Society for Digital Humanities devoted to exploring the role of graduate students in the forming digital scholarly environment.
