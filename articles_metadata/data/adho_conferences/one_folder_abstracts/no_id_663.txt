This paper offers a framework for understanding the relevance of digital forensics to digital humanities research by of the BitCurator project, an environment for creating digital forensics workflows in a variety of institutional settings.Digital forensics is an applied practice involving the “preservation, identification, extraction, documentation, and interpretation” of digital data as legal evidence (Kruse & Heiser, 2002). We will demonstrate that digital forensics offers researchers an advanced community of practice around the acquisition, processing, management, and analysis of born-digital objects, and we will suggest that as humanities scholars increasingly engaged with objects of born-digital cultural heritage, digital forensics will emerge as a significant modality within DH. Finally, we will argue that digital forensics offers an especially fruitful area for collaborative research and project development between digital humanities and the digital archives community.
