This paper describes our use of an encoding system that allows editors to present a transcription of the text of the document alongside the variant states of the text, making it possible to go beyond the encoding of documents. For the purposes of textual scholarship, it is necessary to have a clear idea of what is meant by “representing the text of the document.” It is not enough to represent this, we must also represent variant states of the text and give editorial interpretation a more explicit place in the transcription of primary sources.
