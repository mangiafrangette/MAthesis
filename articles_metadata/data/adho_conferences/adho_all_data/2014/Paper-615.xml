        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Digital storage systems are like
tins. They might have some content but the only evidence are labels, captions
or any kind of lettering. In addition maybe the weight of the tin could be
taken to judge about its inside but still to get full assurance the tin has to
be opened to be able to identify the content correctly. In order to open it an
appropriate tool is necessary and another one to take something out of it,
something like a fork or a spoon. </p>
        <p>A digital storage like a hard drive
behaves very similar to that but in case of magnetic recording the data is not
only invisible from in and outside the storage, not even can it be detected
physically by a human being. Digital data has no appearance that can be touched,
we have no sense for it. </p>
        <p>In
addition to that any bit stream stored on a data carrier needs to be migrated
after a certain time to ensure accessibility and consistency because following three factors
endanger the digital archiving process:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>The storage media decays over time
and it can fail by aging.</item>
          <item>Hardware gets incompatible so that accessing
the data becomes impossible.</item>
          <item>File formats – technical metadata –
change and develop over time. Therefore programs to interpret the file content
might not be available in future.</item>
          <item>Missing contextual metadata make any
digital bit stream more or less useless. </item>
        </list>
        <head>Migration</head>
        <p>Each of these possibilities is a major
drawback for cultural heritage preservation and each one renders data into
digital waste, data that is either lost completely or without meaningful sense. Continuous migration and copy storage content in periodic intervals are today’s
best practice to transform binary information into the future. Theoretically migration works very well because digital data can be copied without loss, which is one of the major advantages of any digital code like binary information or our even alphabet. The ability to copy data lossless allows not only the arbitrary replacement of the data carrier, it also allows to increase redundancy by storing multiple copies, as e.g. proposed by LOCKSS<ref target="n1" rend="sup">1</ref>. The down
side of migration is the financial effort associated with it.
Independent of the specific costs per migration, archiving is getting expensive
sooner or later because of the short lifetime of the technology. In addition its dependence on numerous cascaded technologies makes it a
fragile process that can cause dramatic data loss if only one of the incorporated components fails.  </p>
        <p>Migration can be omitted if the
storage media fulfills the following requirements:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>It must contain human readable
metadata in order to describe the archived object and it's context.</item>
          <item>Information on how to recover the
original file (the decoding manual) must be part of the metadata. This
knowledge is the key to interpret the archived byte stream.</item>
          <item>The file format must be well documented (open format) and it must be widely used to ensure its accessibility over time.   </item>
          <item>Digital data is stored hardware
independent as far as possible. Thus it is not affected by the change of
technology.</item>
        </list>
        <p>If a medium claims to be suitable
for long-term preservation of digital data it has to fulfill more requirements.
Lunt et al.<ref target="n2" rend="sup">2</ref> identified 7 characteristics, which are particularly
interesting to archivists regarding preservation of digital data. The first
says, there shouldn’t be active maintenance or migration required to preserve
actual data. They continue with: 2) no special storage conditions are necessary
to preserve the storage media; 3) a minimum lifetime of at least 100 years,
preferably more should be supported; 4) no energy is required to maintain the
data; 5) the media is easily transported; 6) the data format is widely adopted;
7) the medium has a large storage capacity.</p>
        <head>Bits-on-Film Approach </head>
        <p>Facing those facts the Digital
Humanities Lab of the University of Basel has developed a workflow for
migration-less preservation of digital data on optical media called “Monolith”.
It combines the advantages of photographic material and standard digital
imaging technology to create a long-term migration-less archiving system. This
is achieved by the hybrid characteristics of the optical carrier. Any arbitrary
binary bit stream is put right besides human readable technical, structural,
and contextual metadata. Original files of any appropriate format are stored on
film as visual 2D-barcodes. Technically spoken every bit of the original bit
stream (the file to be stored) is converted into a spot representation on film.
A full bit stream then results in a two-dimensional image, an “image of bits“.
In other words the logical data-bits are transformed and represented by dye or
silver of photographic film. This process can be regarded as a materialization
of binary data, which becomes visual and physical. Monolith has no limitation
regarding the format of the file to be archived. However, the documentation of
the file format must be part of the metadata and therefor it should be an open standard like the widely used PDF-A or image formats like
JPEG2000 (<ref target="n3" rend="sup">3</ref>). Metadata can be stored binary or as human readable text
information, e.g. encoded and written in letters on film as any of the well-known
standards like Dublin Core, METS or others. </p>
        <p>














This
approach has various advantages: First, and most important, the bit stream on
film can be read/captured by any digital camera, there is no special hardware
necessary to transform the physical representation of the bits back into
logical states within the computer system. This can be compared to the process
of seeing. As human beings see letters – in fact digital data – the camera sees
signs, spots on film – binary data; Monolith has a visual interface. The decoding of the binary bit stream
is well defined because the explanation of the
code is an inseparable part of the technical metadata set written on film. Like
no other storage media Monolith can not only contain barcodes and text but
images – e.g. thumbnails – as well. Besides its technological features the
storage film has another advantage. It can be stored the same way as regular
archival film. There are no special storage conditions necessary nor does the
film need any specific care. Therefore, Monolith can be regarded more as an
“engraved stone“ than as a data storage for computer systems. It is a “Digital Rosetta Film“. </p>
        <p>But is the application of optical
film for archival purposes reasonable these days? Many companies stopped
production high fidelity film material and very likely the quality – not
stability – of film will drop in the future. For the representation of
photographic images this is of course a major draw back since image quality is
directly related to film quality. In case of Monolith this is irrelevant. The
only function the film has to fulfill is to separate dots spatially,
requirements that are achieved by most photographic materials. The quality of
digital originals will not be disturbed by film quality because they are stored
as binary data and therefore decay of the material has little impact. In
addition any well-known error correction method can be applied. The concept of
a binary representation of data is a simple but a very efficient solution and
it is the reason why every computer storage system is adapting this concept<ref target="n4" rend="sup">4</ref>. Even if film won't be available in future, for any existing Monolith this means no impact. Not for the sustainability nor for the future ability for data recovery.</p>
        <p>All those features show that
materialized bits are not only a nice concept to mimic historic documents but also
an efficient way to transport digital cultural heritage into the future<ref target="n5" rend="sup">5</ref>. In
the presentation we will show how Monolith works and what its advantages are. </p><p> </p>

        <head>Conclusion </head>
        <p>Monolith is a solution that has made its way from university to a commercial company. It shows that there is a possibility for an alternative solution for classical digital archiving, that doesn't need to be migrated. The advantages are not only of technical but also of economical nature. Even if costs for plain storage media decrease with time, total costs of ownership for archived digital data increased in the last years continuously and migration is the primary costs driver of archiving. Therefore Monolith can not only be an answer for technological but also for economical challenges on the way of digital information to the future.</p>
