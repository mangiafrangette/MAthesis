<p><span class="font3">The Transforming Musicology project began in 2013, with funding from the UK’s Arts and Humanities&nbsp;Research Council. It had three primary aims: to explore&nbsp;how technology could enhance, and perhaps&nbsp;‘transform’, the practice and dissemination of&nbsp;conventional musicological research; to explore how&nbsp;large, new online sources of information, such as social&nbsp;media, might be exploited by digital musicology; and&nbsp;to look, in a modest way, at how digital approaches&nbsp;might be adopted in a sustainable way by the&nbsp;musicological community and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, we give an overview of the project and how it developed, discuss our strategy for approaching&nbsp;these goals, and reflect on how an inclusive strategy for&nbsp;both research and teaching can be effective, despite its&nbsp;organisational and financial costs.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Transforming Musicology research project</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Conventional musicology is represented in the project by two research strands, one drawing on music&nbsp;from the early modern period and with an emphasis&nbsp;on corpus-based research, and the other considering&nbsp;both the psychological perception and the historical&nbsp;reception of Wagner's use of leitmotifs, centred on his&nbsp;Ring cycle. The project also funded four mini-projects,&nbsp;selected from an open call, to extend the range of&nbsp;research that Transforming Musicology could cover.&nbsp;These, like our research on musicology of online&nbsp;communities, could then be treated as case studies for&nbsp;an analysis of technology needs and overlaps, points of&nbsp;connection, workflows and the areas where&nbsp;connective technologies such as Linked Data might be&nbsp;most effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">early modern </span><span class="font3">strand of our project builds on two corpora: Early Music Online (EMO), scanned&nbsp;images and metadata for 300 sixteenth-century&nbsp;printed music books owned by the British Library; and&nbsp;the Electronic Corpus of Lute Music (ECOLM), a&nbsp;collection of full-text encodings and metadata for lute&nbsp;music. These contain closely interrelated music, and&nbsp;Optical Music Recognition tools were used to support&nbsp;the extraction of musical information from the&nbsp;facsimile images. Additional funding supported the&nbsp;creation of an open Linked Data union catalogue&nbsp;connecting the resources to one another and to&nbsp;relevant external resources, and the creation of a&nbsp;prototype application that supports both the linking&nbsp;process, and the publishing of web pages based on the&nbsp;now-linked resources. In collaboration with the BBC&nbsp;(the UK’s national broadcaster) this resulted in&nbsp;demonstration pages for a BBC radio programme, the&nbsp;Early Music Show, allowing navigation of broadcast&nbsp;programme information, enriched with images and&nbsp;information from EMO, ECOLM, DBPedia and other&nbsp;sources of Linked Data (Weigl et al., 2016). Meanwhile,&nbsp;the musical content can be analysed to explore the&nbsp;creative process of arranging the vocal music of EMO&nbsp;for the lute, as seen in ECOLM (Lewis, Crawford &amp;&nbsp;Mullensiefen, 2016)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Wagner </span><span class="font3">research strand has two elements. Firstly, we are exploring the early development of&nbsp;guidebooks and other media aimed at helping&nbsp;listeners recognise and follow the so-called leitmotifs&nbsp;in Wagner’s four-opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen.&nbsp;These diverge from the composer’s own description of&nbsp;the use of motifs in his works, and tease out different&nbsp;aspects of the musical and dramatic themes of the&nbsp;works. In addition to the musicological question here,&nbsp;we also investigate whether a semantic web ontology&nbsp;can usefully represent the diversity of motifs, their&nbsp;different expressions and their relationships&nbsp;(Rindfleisch, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second Wagner element is psychological, with biometric readings taken from audience members&nbsp;during performances of all four operas of the cycle.&nbsp;Along with memory tests, these provide us with a huge&nbsp;amount of data to interpret, and challenges for how to&nbsp;publish that data in ways that are useful to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further to this real-time physiological data, we also have expert annotations of a score, recording&nbsp;performance aspects that might be significant in the&nbsp;subject responses but not recorded in the notation,&nbsp;along with a complex set of information for aligning&nbsp;the time-based responses with each other and with a&nbsp;musical score (Baker &amp; Mullensiefen, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A vast quantity of music of all kinds has become available on the web during recent decades and has&nbsp;engendered a correspondingly large amount of&nbsp;commentary, whether simply in the form of ‘likes', or&nbsp;through intense online discussion on specialist&nbsp;websites to sophisticated scholarly articles. We carried&nbsp;out a pilot investigation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">user communities </span><span class="font3">on a&nbsp;lyric-annotation website, genius.com, formerly Rap&nbsp;Genius. With over 3,000,000 annotations, this can be&nbsp;regarded as a paradigmatic and valuable musicological&nbsp;resource which needs to be approached with the&nbsp;techniques of Big Data; our work has been centred on&nbsp;the overlaps between the networks of annotators and&nbsp;the songs and artists they annotate (Fields &amp; Rhodes,&nbsp;2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The four </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">mini-projects </span><span class="font3">have contributed: audio analysis of historical electronic music; ornamentation&nbsp;style in traditional Irish flute playing (Jancovic, Kokuer,&nbsp;and Baptiste, 2015); a big data approach to finding the&nbsp;sources of the poetry used in medieval sacred songs;&nbsp;and an exploration of 18-20th-century London&nbsp;musical life based on digitised concert information&nbsp;from programmes and newspapers (Dix et al., 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For these investigations, we have evaluated how </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">semantic web technologies </span><span class="font3">may offer solutions for&nbsp;bridging between disparate data and tool sets, and&nbsp;help document the research and its data, making it&nbsp;more reproducible as a result. (Nurmikko-Fuller and&nbsp;Page, 2016)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Transforming Musicology website’s </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Publications section</span><span class="font3"> offers a more complete list of&nbsp;research outputs than can be covered here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have embedded engagement with technology, musicology and other music-related communities in&nbsp;our work in general, but the most significant step for&nbsp;us in ensuring sustainability for digital musicology has&nbsp;been the creation of a week-long digital musicology&nbsp;workshop as part of the Digital Humanities at Oxford&nbsp;Summer School. The summer school is the largest of its&nbsp;kind in Europe, and is made up of a framework&nbsp;programme, consisting of a morning session each day,&nbsp;after which students attend the more specialist&nbsp;workshop they have selected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By summer 2017, this will have run in three consecutive years and attracted a diverse set of over&nbsp;fifty students.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching Digital Musicology at the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Although courses do exist on specialist areas within musicology (such as the Music Encoding Initiative&nbsp;summer school in Paderborn) this is the first&nbsp;dedicated to the whole discipline. In designing the&nbsp;curriculum, the Transforming Musicology team have&nbsp;reflected on how we can best make the methods that&nbsp;we have investigated over the course of the project -along with others that we know are used and work&nbsp;well - readily accessible to the wider musicology&nbsp;community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just as we have endeavoured to be inclusive in our approach to the musicological research that we have&nbsp;undertaken and supported within the project, we have&nbsp;also sought to create a space in which musicologists&nbsp;can be introduced to, and given the opportunity to&nbsp;experiment with, a wide variety of tools and&nbsp;approaches. It is important to us that the questions&nbsp;that musicologists investigate are not distorted when&nbsp;technology is brought to bear, and our teaching reflects&nbsp;this by balancing sessions about general-purpose tools&nbsp;with domain-specific use-case descriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Students are eased into the week with an introduction giving an overview of the week ahead, but&nbsp;also some personal reflections about moving into a&nbsp;digital musicology approach from a more traditional&nbsp;background, and each day begins with presentations&nbsp;of case studies to motivate the techniques introduced&nbsp;during that day. Each day broadly considers a single&nbsp;topic, covering audio processing on both a small and&nbsp;large scale, music encoding, Optical Music Recognition&nbsp;and music processing. The final day presents more&nbsp;case studies and closes with a round table discussion&nbsp;which is intended to give the students the opportunity&nbsp;to reflect on the week and their own research practice&nbsp;and consider if and how the skills that they have&nbsp;learned can be useful to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The workshop is intended to stimulate ideas rather than to make programmers and audio engineers of our&nbsp;students, although we do still expect students to&nbsp;perform simple programming tasks and introduce&nbsp;them to key audio concepts and tools. Such lofty, longterm goals are difficult to evaluate. We take immediate&nbsp;feedback through a form on the last day, although the&nbsp;longer-term effect of attending can only be seen as the&nbsp;students develop their research in the coming years.&nbsp;Shorter-term impacts, including collaborations with&nbsp;tutors on papers and research proposals, and&nbsp;increasing contributions to conferences and&nbsp;workshops with an explicitly digital aspect can already&nbsp;be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Musicology has always been interdisciplinary in nature, and has been transforming itself based on&nbsp;contributions from computing and web technology for&nbsp;over fifty years. We see our project as contributing to&nbsp;and supporting that transformation, both through our&nbsp;own research and through developing the skills of&nbsp;others.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgements</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Transforming Musicology is funded by the UK Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (ref: AH/L006820/1)&nbsp;and has benefitted from many contributors. The&nbsp;Transforming Musicology website lists the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">core&nbsp;researchers and investigators</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">the advisory panel</span><span class="font3">, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini-project researchers and investigators</span><span class="font3">. Similarly,&nbsp;there is too little space to acknowledge tutors,&nbsp;speakers and organisers for the summer school, but&nbsp;their contributions have informed the above&nbsp;discussion in many ways.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
