<p><span class="font7">The changes effected by digital platforms on reading continue to be a contested area in popular&nbsp;culture, pedagogy, and higher education. This is also an&nbsp;area where electronic literature (e-lit), digital&nbsp;humanities scholarship, and information science can&nbsp;shed much light. Works of e-lit are a rich testing&nbsp;ground to explore how creative, non-commercial uses&nbsp;of digital media have been exploited and proposed to&nbsp;readers. In our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Handbook of Electronic Literature&nbsp;Reading,</span><span class="font7"> we explore the reading instructions&nbsp;accompanying e-lit works to investigate the&nbsp;performative engagement of reading from the&nbsp;perspective of storage medium, objects and modes of&nbsp;interaction, and gestures or actions. The data included&nbsp;in the reading instructions shed light on how reading&nbsp;practices have morphed depending on platform&nbsp;historically over the last three decades. This focus has&nbsp;warranted an examination into current bibliographic&nbsp;practices to determine how the new modalities of e-lit&nbsp;require different descriptive methods and approaches&nbsp;to metadata creation.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">To say that digital reading platforms (web, ereaders, smartphones, etc.) are changing the way reading has been practiced in the age of print is now a&nbsp;truism. Often, these shifts have been the object of&nbsp;elegiac meditations (Birkerts, Manguel) and&nbsp;pedagogical concerns (NEA's “Reading at Risk” and “To&nbsp;Read or Not to Read”). These approaches highlight the&nbsp;‘erosion’ that the practice of reading is undergoing. A&nbsp;useful corrective has been Andrew Piper’s Book Was&nbsp;There. His call to think about reading from the basis of&nbsp;“the relationship between reading and hands, [and]&nbsp;the long history of how touch has shaped reading and,&nbsp;by extension, our sense of ourselves while we read” (3)&nbsp;has brought to light the bodily handling of reading&nbsp;objects. Our understanding of reading and text as a&nbsp;performative kind of practice has begun to take shape.&nbsp;For Rita Raley, text is “the whole of the event, its&nbsp;physical, logical, and conceptual architecture; the&nbsp;enactment and experience; its temporal structures;&nbsp;and associated social and juridical protocols” (2013:&nbsp;21). Similarly, for Johanna Drucker, we need to&nbsp;elaborate “a different conception of artifacts (books,&nbsp;documents, works of textual or graphic art), one in&nbsp;which reception is production and therefore all&nbsp;materiality is subject to performative engagement&nbsp;within varied, and specific, conditions of encounter”&nbsp;(2014).</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Electronic Literature Instructions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Though a sizeable body of e-lit scholarship has focused on matters like textuality, software, meaning&nbsp;making systems, code, preservation, etc. reading has&nbsp;not been at the forefront. The experimental qualities of&nbsp;e-lit have produced a great diversity of interaction&nbsp;modalities and ways of handling the objects that&nbsp;supports said experimentation. Nevertheless, an&nbsp;understudied convention of e-lit are the instructions&nbsp;accompanying most works. These instructions go from&nbsp;some of the most radically sensuous like Serge&nbsp;Bouchardon’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blow,</span><span class="font7"> “Blow to read the text then to&nbsp;spread the words. This scene requires a microphone”&nbsp;(Fig 1); to more conventional ones like “click your&nbsp;mouse at the right edge of the screen to move right to&nbsp;a new region of texts [and] tap the arrow keys to move”&nbsp;from Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sea and&nbsp;Spar Between</span><span class="font7"> (Fig 2).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4">Blow</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Blow to read the text then to spread the words. This scene requires a microphone. If you don't have one, click on &quot;refuse&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Click to continue</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fig 1. Screenshot from Serge Bouchardon's Blow</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sea and Spar Between</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> is a poetry generator which defines a space of language populated by a number of stanzas comparable to the number of fish in the sea, around 225 trillion. Each stanza is indicated by two coordinates, as&nbsp;with latitude and longitude. They range from 0:0 to 14992383:14992383. To operate the system, you may</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move your mouse;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;press the spacebar to mark the stanza that is in the center of the screen of that moment, bringing its&nbsp;coordinates into the navigation box at the bottom in order to note them and return to this view;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dick your mouse at the right edge of tire screen to move right to a new region of texts (to increase tire first&nbsp;coordinate); dick your mouse at the bottom, left, or top to move similarly in those directions;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tap tire arrow keys to move the visible lattice of stanzas up, right, down, or left by a single stanza;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scroll the wheel on your mouse or tap the A and Z keys on the keyboard to zoom in and out;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type a pair of coordinates into tire navigation box at the bottom and press </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">enter</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> to move anywhere in tire&nbsp;sea of text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fig 2. Screenshot from Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland's Sea and Spar Between</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The paratextual dimension of these instructions has been on the margins of the studies focusing on&nbsp;particular works. Cumulatively, however, the&nbsp;information kept on these reading instructions can&nbsp;signal the shifts that e-lit has enacted on reading in&nbsp;digital platforms. Even more broadly, as a sample of the&nbsp;many experimental and still unstable standards of&nbsp;reading in digital platforms, e-lit reading instructions&nbsp;can offer evidence of practices that may be becoming&nbsp;more integral to the act of reading. Similarly, the&nbsp;mentions of the hardware (mouse, microphone,&nbsp;keyboard, etc.) required to read e-lit works provide&nbsp;detailed insights on the historical role that&nbsp;technological developments have enacted on reading&nbsp;as a performative engagement.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Metadata and Description</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The new affordances offered by e-lit increase the scope of bibliographic practices in ways that allow for&nbsp;more coordinated retrieval but also create greater&nbsp;depth and specificity in records as datasets. Many&nbsp;descriptive metadata standards have been largely&nbsp;shaped by the predominance of print media, and while&nbsp;its qualities overlap with those of e-lit, emerging&nbsp;characteristics of the latter require extensible&nbsp;structures to be considered comprehensively&nbsp;described. E-lit specific metadata sets have been&nbsp;developed by initiatives like Electronic Literature as a&nbsp;Model of Creativity and Innovation in Practice&nbsp;(ELMCIP) and the Electronic Literature Directory&nbsp;(ELD). However, among them there is still a variety of&nbsp;descriptive approaches and objectives. The&nbsp;Consortium on Electronic Literature (CELL) has taken&nbsp;significant steps towards interoperability and a&nbsp;“consensual model for the object of this field”&nbsp;(Baldwin) while still acknowledging the particular&nbsp;interest of individual archives and datasets. Efforts like&nbsp;this may still be enhanced through greater&nbsp;reconciliation with existing bibliographic procedures.&nbsp;In e-lit the interaction between a work and a reader&nbsp;poses new ontological considerations for descriptive&nbsp;orientations suitable to examine the particularities of&nbsp;reading in digital platforms. Hayles’ concept of&nbsp;intermediation proposes that the emergent processes&nbsp;that occur when reading e-lit forms a dynamic&nbsp;heterarchy in which both reader and work&nbsp;continuously inform and shape the trajectory by which&nbsp;reading unfolds (2007:100). This process reframes the&nbsp;ontic nature of work and reader, dissolving the duality&nbsp;into a single event. New qualities surface as a result,&nbsp;highlighting the different modalities through which&nbsp;intermediation occurs and inform bibliographic&nbsp;projects. Navigating these qualities and the language&nbsp;with which they are described poses new challenges&nbsp;for interoperability with similar collections in addition&nbsp;to being synthesized into the extensive legacies of&nbsp;bibliographic practices.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Handbook</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Handbook of E-Lit Reading</span><span class="font7"> collects screenshots of the reading instructions of e-lit works and documents&nbsp;them according to storage medium (web, iPad, CD-ROM, floppy disk, etc.), actions or gestures (blow, click,&nbsp;scroll, type, etc.) and hardware (web cam, keyboard,&nbsp;mouse, microphone, etc.). The pilot target corpus&nbsp;includes ~200 works from over twenty countries&nbsp;anthologized in the Electronic Literature Collections&nbsp;Vol. 1, 2, and 3. The data extracted from the instruction&nbsp;pages will be analyzed and cross- referenced in order&nbsp;to observe emerging patterns like most common&nbsp;practices, most resilient ones, the rise and fall of some&nbsp;of them, as well as the introduction of new&nbsp;technological developments in hardware or software&nbsp;that have marked important shifts in the creation and&nbsp;reading of e-lit. This corpus, though not exhaustive,&nbsp;provides a starting point to design a suitable metadata&nbsp;set and test the categories included in it. Ultimately, the&nbsp;corpus will also encompass enough data to start&nbsp;drawing a hypothesis and identify future directions for&nbsp;the project.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h3>
