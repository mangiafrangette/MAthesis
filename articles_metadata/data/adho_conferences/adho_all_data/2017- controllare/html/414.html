<p><span class="font2">The HathiTrust Bookworm (HT+Bookworm) is an interactive tool for visualizing content from the&nbsp;HathiTrust Digital Library, which contains almost 15&nbsp;million volumes of digitized text (Auvil et al. 2015).&nbsp;Our poster describes the application of&nbsp;HT+Bookworm in teaching. Studies show that the&nbsp;complexity of integrating into pedagogical practice&nbsp;text analysis tools operating over large datasets is a&nbsp;significant barrier to their uptake (Green et al. 2016),&nbsp;and that the best solution is to use a pre-populated text&nbsp;analysis tool (Sinclair and Rockwell 2012, Rockwell et&nbsp;al. 2010). HT+Bookworm accomplishes this by&nbsp;facilitating exploration of the “big” textual data of the&nbsp;HathiTrust Digital Library’s collection without&nbsp;requiring mastery of complex technology. We recently&nbsp;used HT+Bookworm in class sessions co-taught by&nbsp;two of us as part of literature classes at the University&nbsp;of Michigan, Ann Arbor to undergraduate students&nbsp;who had no prior familiarity with quantitative&nbsp;approaches to text analysis. One of our objectives was&nbsp;to help students discover how the meanings of words&nbsp;can vary — both when word meanings change over&nbsp;time, and when the same word, when borrowed from&nbsp;one discipline or domain and applied to a different&nbsp;discipline or domain (or simply applied independently&nbsp;in two different domains), takes on separate&nbsp;meanings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rens Bod argues that it is only when humanistic disciplines are compared on a large scale that patterns&nbsp;across them become visible (Bod 2013).&nbsp;HT+Bookworm enables the discovery of such patterns&nbsp;by facilitating comparison across categories of&nbsp;knowledge. While search engines are adept at finding&nbsp;individual texts within a digital library, Bookworm&nbsp;performs a different task — abstracting across&nbsp;categories within the library and visualizing those&nbsp;abstractions. These abstractions, which are a form of&nbsp;‘distant reading’ (Moretti 2013), are generated in the&nbsp;context of a specific textual fragment (for example, a&nbsp;word or phrase), through the variation of some&nbsp;attribute of the manifestation of that text fragment&nbsp;across the categories defined by some categorization&nbsp;scheme. A typical categorization scheme is the&nbsp;organization of the digital library by Library of&nbsp;Congress (LoC) classes as metadata, and a typical&nbsp;attribute of the manifestation of a word or phrase&nbsp;across categories is its normalized frequency of&nbsp;occurrence across those categories. HT+Bookworm&nbsp;works with both discrete sets of categories such as LoC&nbsp;classes as well as with continuous categories such as&nbsp;time. A time-series plot of the normalized frequency of&nbsp;occurrence of a word over a chronological range,&nbsp;within certain specified LoC classes, provides a sense&nbsp;of how the relative occurrence of that word or phrase&nbsp;has varied across those LoC classes over the specified&nbsp;time range. Students generate visualizations&nbsp;consisting of layered time-series plots (stacked area&nbsp;charts) for the relative frequency of their words of&nbsp;interest, within determinate categories of interest in&nbsp;the HathiTrust Digital Library collection. These&nbsp;categories correspond to the layers (stacks) of the&nbsp;plot, with each layer encompassing an LoC class and&nbsp;time represented along the x-axis. The HT+Bookworm&nbsp;tool also provides, at each point in the plot, a subset&nbsp;list of volumes that contribute the most to the attribute&nbsp;being plotted. This list, accessible by mouse-click at&nbsp;the requisite point, serves as the gateway to the&nbsp;digitized text of the individual volumes in the list. This&nbsp;affordance helps students bridge the gap between the&nbsp;abstraction of distant reading and the discovery of&nbsp;specific texts that they can then investigate further&nbsp;through close reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our poster includes instances of the kinds of exploration HT+Bookworm made possible for&nbsp;students. An example follows. The concept of “fidelity”&nbsp;(an important word to explore in connection with&nbsp;translation studies, a topic of the classes) shows&nbsp;different characteristics when explored in English (in&nbsp;which the concept maps onto the two words “fidelity”&nbsp;and “faithfulness”) and in Spanish (where the concept&nbsp;maps onto the single word “fidelidad”). Investigating&nbsp;the occurrence of the word by LoC category allows&nbsp;students to explore hypotheses such as whether the&nbsp;greater strength, historically speaking, of religious&nbsp;tradition in the Spanish-speaking world in comparison&nbsp;with the Anglophone world affects the relative&nbsp;prevalence of this word in different domains of use.&nbsp;Another example is a stacked area chart for a word of&nbsp;a kind for which HT+Bookworm helps provide an&nbsp;understanding of the word’s differentiated meanings&nbsp;in different use categories (for example, in the case of&nbsp;the word “depression”, in the use category of&nbsp;psychology and medicine versus that of economics).&nbsp;HT+Bookworm accomplishes this by abstracting&nbsp;separately across different LoC classes, while aiding in&nbsp;the indication of the points in time at which, for each&nbsp;class, the word entered widespread usage.</span></p>
