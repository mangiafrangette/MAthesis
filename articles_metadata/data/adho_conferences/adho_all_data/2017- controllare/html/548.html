<p><span class="font3">This poster describes the development and uses of Archivlo, an application for improving the archival research workflow and enabling a more collaborative&nbsp;digital research community. In recent years, digital&nbsp;history has emerged as a vibrant subfield of the digital&nbsp;humanities community (see Robertson, 2016; and&nbsp;Weingart, 2016).Currently, the majority of digital history projects rely on digitized corpuses or community&nbsp;compiled datasets. However, the archival materials&nbsp;used in these projects represent only a small fraction&nbsp;of the archival sources that scholars currently utilize&nbsp;in their research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moreover, the proliferation of digital cameras and scanners has resulted in a wealth of archival material&nbsp;for scholars, but this digitized archival data is usually&nbsp;scattered across hard drives. To organize this data,&nbsp;scholars currently either keep notes or re-purpose bibliographic software.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Data management software provide some solutions to dealing with this abundance of material (such as Devonthink, Evernote, Zotero, and most recently,&nbsp;Tropy) but individual scholars often must invest a&nbsp;great deal of energy and time replicating the organizational structure of the archives to make sense of their&nbsp;research. This siloed approach to archival research&nbsp;makes finding information about archival collections&nbsp;or other scholars working in the archives difficult. Ar-chivlo is designed to solve these problems, and create&nbsp;a more coherent workflow for organizing archival&nbsp;data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This poster will outline the development and design of Archivlo, from the early idea stages to our initial beta model. Archivlo is currently in progress, and the&nbsp;poster will share our experience building a web-based&nbsp;application, as well as designing a user interface that&nbsp;privileges data interoperability and flexibility. Archi-vlo is written in Python and Angular, and is fully opensource on Github. To access archival data, Archivlo utilizes archives' APIs and web page annotations to allow&nbsp;researchers to find collections. Users are able to save&nbsp;their archival collection research in their profile, and&nbsp;indicate whether they have worked in these archives&nbsp;or are interested in using the archive. This functionality adds efficiencies to how scholars locate and keep&nbsp;track of their archival research. Users can also export&nbsp;their records to multiple file formats, as well as other&nbsp;data management software, such as Zotero andDevon-think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Additionally, Archivlo enables users to share their lists of visited and interested in archives, which we believe will help scholars share information about archives and potentially even form collaborations. For&nbsp;archivists, Archivlo can also provide data on user interest vis-a-vis usage of their archival collections. We&nbsp;believe our experience with Archivlo will be of interest&nbsp;to other digital humanities developers and project&nbsp;managers, as well as digital humanists who work with&nbsp;archival collections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Previous efforts to encourage digital collaboration among researchers in archives have, with a few exceptions, largely faltered, with most of these projects requiring a high technical literacy to contribute to a database or extensive time to transcribe records (see&nbsp;Mostern and Arksey, 2016. Moreover, these efforts to&nbsp;construct large databases of archival data have been&nbsp;forced, through copyright restrictions, to limit their&nbsp;scope to material that is either from prior to the early&nbsp;twentieth century or born digital materials). Instead of&nbsp;requiring large resources to digitize materials or&nbsp;standardize collections, Archivlo presents an alternative solution to this problem - focusing on how scholars work with archives to enable more digital and collaborative research. We believe Archivlo will encourage more productive data management practices&nbsp;among scholars, and reduce inefficiencies in the archival research workflow. Much of Archivlo's goals remain experimental, and the opportunity to present our&nbsp;work at DH 2017 would help us share our progress and&nbsp;consider future directions for the tool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ultimately, we hope that Archivlo can help further the digital humanities ethos of digital collaboration,&nbsp;and present one solution for using tools to help foster&nbsp;digital research communities.</span></p>
