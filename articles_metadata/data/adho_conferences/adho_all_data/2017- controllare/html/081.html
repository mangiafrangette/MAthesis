<p><span class="font1">This poster offers a concise working plan of a digital project titled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1947 Partition on the Margins:&nbsp;The Untold Testimonies of Sikh, Bahawalpur and&nbsp;Marwari Communities</span><span class="font1">. The project aims to collect&nbsp;undocumented narratives of many ‘Punjabi' and&nbsp;‘Rajasthani' communities who migrated from&nbsp;villages in current Eastern Pakistan to villages in the&nbsp;current Western India during the 1947 partition. The&nbsp;primary objective of the project is to create an open&nbsp;access visual and narrative based digital archive of&nbsp;partition and post-partition testimonies developed&nbsp;through audio-video transcripts and photographs.&nbsp;The audio-visual transcripts will be collected&nbsp;through personal interviews of the partition&nbsp;witnesses, their families and subsequent&nbsp;generations. These interviews will take place on-site&nbsp;in their villages. This population mostly consists of&nbsp;Sikh, Bahawalpur and Marwari communities who&nbsp;travelled comparatively short distances during&nbsp;partition, settling in the nearby villages close to the&nbsp;border in Indian states of Rajasthan and Punjab. The&nbsp;geographical distance travelled by these&nbsp;communities towards Indian villages was only about&nbsp;40 to 50 KM. However, the spatial definitions&nbsp;changed and any hope of revisiting the ancestral&nbsp;homeland was shattered with the newly constructed&nbsp;international border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are a few minority communities residing in small villages whose partition experiences are not&nbsp;traced in public memory or documented in any&nbsp;literature, primarily because their journey of&nbsp;migration was relatively hushed and non-violent.&nbsp;However, the geo-political movement from one place&nbsp;to another brought larger social, cultural, political&nbsp;and economic challenges in the post-independence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">India for families in these many communities. They migrated from one small village to another leaving&nbsp;behind whatever geographical, economical and&nbsp;cultural assets that belonged to them. Even after&nbsp;almost 70 years of partition in 1947, families in these&nbsp;communities are struggling to own lands of their&nbsp;own. The generation that witnessed the partition of&nbsp;1947 is disappearing and will not be there after next&nbsp;4 to 5 years. Therefore, it becomes an obligatory task&nbsp;to document the narratives of a traumatic historical&nbsp;event that completely changed the flow of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The subsequent generations of these families who migrated to India continue to face economic and&nbsp;cultural challenges. The nostalgia of not being able to&nbsp;visit their ancestral homeland disturbs the process&nbsp;of connecting with their current homeland.&nbsp;Therefore, this project aims to contextualise these&nbsp;first-hand audio-video interviews and photographs&nbsp;into narratives that will provide an influential&nbsp;palimpsest of history and the contemporary cultural&nbsp;and political state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are several ongoing digital projects that contextualise historical events into narratives such&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1947 Partition Archive</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1984 Living History</span><span class="font1">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kashmir Oral History</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Indian Memory Project</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span><span class="font1">. The memory projects&nbsp;on the 1947 partition such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1947 Partition Archive&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">mostly record stories that are often (rightly so)&nbsp;narratives of violence and bloodshed. However,&nbsp;there is gap in existing literature and database that&nbsp;do not document less violent partition experiences&nbsp;of a large population that mostly live at the western&nbsp;Indian border. The aim of the current project is to&nbsp;document those unheard communities which&nbsp;escaped immediate violence but continue to suffer&nbsp;the residual pains of geo-cultural and economical&nbsp;traumas in post-partition India. The poster also&nbsp;offers a framework of methodology to be followed&nbsp;for developing the project. The methodology&nbsp;involves collection of data by visiting the villages,&nbsp;audio-video interviews with families, collecting&nbsp;photographs and letters, transcription and&nbsp;description of interviews and contextualising&nbsp;photographs and letters in narratives. The&nbsp;development of final testimonies achieved through&nbsp;these working stages will be developed into an open&nbsp;access website, hosted through KSHIP (Knowledge&nbsp;Sharing In Publication) which is a multilingual&nbsp;academic publishing project at IIT (Indian Institute&nbsp;of Technology) Indore, India.</span></p>
