<p><span class="font4">During the creation of the Melville Electronic Library (MEL), we have developed a suite of software applications that, taken together, provide a powerful&nbsp;system for the creation of critical archives. In this software demonstration, we will demonstrate how these</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">applications work, using the editing of Herman Melville's </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Billy Budd</span><span class="font4"> as an example. We will demonstrate the editorial process from the initial encounter with a&nbsp;manuscript leaf to the publishing of a web based reading text complete with a critical apparatus and editorial notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We will demonstrate the use of the following software applications:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">TextLab</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Juxta Editions</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">MEL Catalog</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Textlab</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Billy Budd</span><span class="font4"> comes to us in the author's original manuscript, existing print editions, and many other media instantiations. This multiplicity is what John Bryant,&nbsp;the chief editor of MEL, refers to as a “fluid text.”&nbsp;(2002). TextLab aids in the transcription of the manuscript, the presentation of the manuscript facsimile,&nbsp;and the production of a base text. TextLab also aids in&nbsp;secondary editing, which is the process of identifying&nbsp;alternative readings at points of revision in the editing&nbsp;process. The ultimate aim is to retain the fluid quality&nbsp;of the text using digital tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TextLab's team environment allows several editors to work simultaneously and independently on the&nbsp;hundreds of leaves of manuscript material. The interface pairs an XML editor with a high resolution image,&nbsp;and deep zoom functionality, allowing close-up viewing of the manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Textlab transforms TIFF images of the manuscript leaves into &quot;pyramidal TIFFs&quot; and serves them using a&nbsp;IIIF compliant image server.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The editor provides a set of XML elements and controlled vocabularies, which are pre-established by the editorial protocols of the edition. The transcriber can&nbsp;mark revision sites on the image using a drawing tool&nbsp;and then link these to the corresponding XML elements that record them. The transcriber can also validate the XML and preview the diplomatic rendering of&nbsp;the leaf before submitting it for inclusion in the edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As transcribers complete their work, the lead editor assembles the submitted transcriptions into a base text. TextLab aids in this process too, allowing the editor to reorder leaves and organize chapters without&nbsp;having to change the XML. In the end, a base text is produced, with diplomatic renderings of each leaf coordinated with the facsimile images. An XML version of the&nbsp;base text is stored in MEL Catalog, which is then retrievable by Juxta Editions.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Juxta Editions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Once a base text has been prepared using TextLab, it is then loaded into Juxta Editions twice. The first&nbsp;copy of the base text is kept for collation with other existing editions. Juxta creates a heat map visualization&nbsp;as well as a side-by-side comparison of the existing&nbsp;versions of the text. The second copy of the base text is&nbsp;then lightly edited for grammar and consistency. This&nbsp;produces a reading text which can then be added to the&nbsp;set of texts being collated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reading text is then annotated by the project team. As editors annotate the text, they can link passages to the MEL Catalog's database. Editors may link&nbsp;passages in the text itself or in the editorial notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the text of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; is ready for publication to MEL, it is published using a customized Jekyll template. Visitors to the site will be able to read the&nbsp;text, trace Melville's words back to the original manuscript, and explore alternative readings through secondary editing and collation.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MEL Catalog</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The MEL Catalog is a database of places, events, artwork, people, and texts from Melville's life and work. It is linked to name authorities such as the Getty Art&nbsp;and Architecture Thesaurus, so that the edition is compatible with linked open data. MEL Catalog can be used&nbsp;to search MEL as well as cross-walk on the objects it&nbsp;collects. MEL Catalog also has support for storing GIS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">data which can then be fed to mapping software the travel itineraries of persons both real and fictional.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Impact</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Through a real-world example, this poster session will demonstrate how three specialized tools, used in&nbsp;conjunction, create a flexible, powerful and coherent&nbsp;process, which allows scholars to contend with source&nbsp;materials and produce digital editions more easily,&nbsp;and more quickly. We will also provide an explanation&nbsp;of how attendees can use these, and other compatible&nbsp;tools, for their own scholarship.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
