<p><span class="font2">This poster reports on research that examines the use of XML markup for student authoring, a&nbsp;marked shift from the mimetic roots of XML and&nbsp;its primary use in digital humanities research, the&nbsp;TEI. Thus far, two courses have been taught with&nbsp;a total enrollment of 35 students (19 students in&nbsp;advanced writing for the technical professions,&nbsp;Summer 2016; 14 students in first-year writing,&nbsp;Fall 2016). The research questions are: How does&nbsp;markup function rhetorically when used for authorship? Does writing in XML and designing&nbsp;schemas for authoring contribute to students'&nbsp;understanding of their writing and reading processes? Do reading and writing practices in the&nbsp;markup classroom transfer to other contexts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These research questions present unique methodological concerns for the study of markup.&nbsp;How can we make claims about the rhetorical and&nbsp;expressive capacities of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">authorial</span><span class="font2"> markup? How&nbsp;can we better understand the role of the schema,&nbsp;the markup, and the platform(s) in students'&nbsp;writing, reading, and thinking processes? In&nbsp;short, how do we study this? These questions will&nbsp;animate the presentation of preliminary results,&nbsp;the subject of the poster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There has been considerable interest in the semantics of markup languages at recent TEI&nbsp;(Ciotti &amp; Tomasi, 2014; Eide, 2013) and DH conferences (Sperberg-McQueen Marcoux, &amp; Huit-feldt, 2010, 2014), most of which has centered&nbsp;around formal approaches to modeling semantics&nbsp;to explicate the meaning of markup (Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, &amp; Renear, 2000). A related&nbsp;thread of markup research has examined the rhetorical and expressive capacities of markup&nbsp;(Flanders, 2004; Flanders &amp; Fiormonte, 2007),&nbsp;growing out of an understanding of markup as&nbsp;not merely descriptive, but also interpretive and,&nbsp;indeed, performative (Renear, 2000). Though</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wernimont and Flanders (2007) have discussed the potentials of authorial markup to expand our&nbsp;shared notions of scholarly communication,&nbsp;markup in this authorial realm remains rarely&nbsp;used (one exception being the work of Desmet et&nbsp;al., 2005) and even more rarely studied in a systematic way. This poster will present preliminary&nbsp;results from just such an attempt—a sustained&nbsp;study of an experimental approach to XML as a&nbsp;technology for the production of texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The production of texts, in this case, was undertaken by two cohorts of undergraduate students. In addition to writing their assignments in XML (using Oxygen), these courses engaged students in a semester-long, collaborative writing&nbsp;project: the design and implementation of a custom XML schema that structurally and rhetorically models a range of genres of writing. Pedagogically, this approach aims to foster the close attention and metacognition often cited in classroom-oriented uses of XML/TEI (e.g., Singer, 2013;&nbsp;Conatser, 2013). Where this approach to markup&nbsp;differs from earlier uses, however, is in the thoroughly bottom-up, data driven approach to&nbsp;schema design (Piez, 2001). Students begin with&nbsp;a (basically) bare schema and—iteratively and&nbsp;deliberately over the course of an entire semester—design and revise the schema for a range of&nbsp;writing tasks using document analysis and modeling, qualitative writing research methods, and&nbsp;their own experiences of authorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To research these classes, I employed a teacher research methodology—a systematic approach to data collection that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">honors the inside perspectives of teachers and students</span><span class="font2">—that&nbsp;adapted qualitative research methods culled from&nbsp;ethnography, education, and writing studies research. Data was gathered from direct participant&nbsp;observation, reflective journaling, qualitative interviews (three interviews each with nine case&nbsp;study students), survey, and the collection of student writing (normal prose and XML, including&nbsp;version control logs for all XML files). Teacher&nbsp;research foregrounds and honors the experiences&nbsp;and perspectives of students as they compose;&nbsp;thus, the particular methods deployed in this&nbsp;study concern writing as a process, rather than as&nbsp;a static product. This methodology aligns with&nbsp;research in rhetoric and writing studies, which,&nbsp;fundamentally, understands “writing (and broader rhetorical practice) as a verb rather than a&nbsp;noun” (McNely and Teston, 2015: 115).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Preliminary results from the study speak to 1) how students develop and operationalize genre&nbsp;knowledge; 2) the rhetorical constraints and af-fordances of schema design as collaborative writing; and 3) markup's reported intervention into&nbsp;students' thinking and writing processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This poster frames this research study as a case study, a demonstration of the kinds of insights that systematic, qualitative research into&nbsp;markup can foster. It aims to organize the audience around a series of questions, including: How&nbsp;are rhetorical theories pertinent to our examination of DH tools and methods, particularly those&nbsp;of data modeling and representation? How does&nbsp;the study of student writing/authorship necessitate a willingness to invent methods sensitive to,&nbsp;and emergent from, particular sites of research?&nbsp;What methodological (re)orientation does an expansion of our disciplinary objects of inquiry require? These questions are best explored interactively, through the dynamic presentation of data&nbsp;generated through this research, and an exploration of the opportunities and limitations of this&nbsp;qualitative approach to markup research.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></p>
