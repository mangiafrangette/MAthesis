<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> has been the official national anthem of the Kingdom of the Netherlands since 1932. The song carries a wider relevance that extends well&nbsp;beyond the Low Countries. According to the authoritative </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Guinness Book of Records</span><span class="font3">, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> is the national anthem with the oldest music in the world: we&nbsp;are able to date the tune and text to the years 15681572 during the Dutch Revolt, a key episode in the history of the Early Low Countries. Moreover, in the&nbsp;song's fifteen couplets, an anonymous poet has immortalized a dramatic internal monologue of William</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the Silent, Prince of Orange (1533 - 1584), a well-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">known figure who has played a decisive role in the political history of Europe (Van Stipriaan, 2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the earliest sources, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> has invariably survived anonymously, in print collections of rebel songs (the so-called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">geuzenliederen</span><span class="font3"> or ‘beggar songs')&nbsp;that date back to the Spanish Occupation in the Low&nbsp;Countries (De Bruin, 1998). Only some of these songs&nbsp;are attributed to known authors; the majority, including the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3">, are not. Apart from the supposed&nbsp;date of composition (1568-1572), there are few historical facts that could help the attribution. Although&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> does not explicitly choose sides in contemporary religious conflicts, circumstantial evidence&nbsp;strongly suggests that the text was written by an author of Flemish or Dutch descent, who was living in a&nbsp;German refugee community at the time, perhaps in the&nbsp;vicinity of Heidelberg, because of a number of striking&nbsp;intertextual connections to other songs that were&nbsp;composed in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ever since its creation in the late sixteenth century, the attribution of the song has not ceased to puzzle&nbsp;scholars as well as other inhabitants of the Low Countries. Only decades after the song's composition, there&nbsp;seems to have been considerable confusion already: in&nbsp;various sources, we find widely divergent attributions&nbsp;of the song to a number of famous authors, such as&nbsp;Marnix of Saint Aldegonde (the mayor of Antwerp,&nbsp;during the city's famous Fall in 1585) or the religious&nbsp;author and philosopher Dirck Coornhert. Many other&nbsp;candidate authors would be suggested in the next centuries, the credibility of which could vary strongly. In&nbsp;the public opinion, Marnix has long remained the most&nbsp;popular candidate, although scholars have never&nbsp;reached any definitive agreement on the issue. As late&nbsp;as 1996, for instance, an entire doctoral thesis was devoted to the authorship of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3">. In this thesis,&nbsp;Maljaars predominantly argued that Marnix could not&nbsp;have been the author, relying on traditional evidence:&nbsp;the results of the close reading of the Wilhelmus, and&nbsp;comparison between the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> and other texts by&nbsp;the presumed author(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 2016 an interdisciplinary team of scholars has tackled this age-old issue from a new perspective: sty-lometry. For most of the candidate authors which have&nbsp;been suggested for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3">, we have available&nbsp;relatively sizable oeuvres of lyrical poems or even&nbsp;highly similar songs. The comparison of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">to those reference oeuvres, using state of the art stylo-metric methodologies, should allow us to estimate the&nbsp;relative distance from the anthem to each candidate&nbsp;author (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">authorship attribution</span><span class="font3">) and verify their authorship (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">authorship verification</span><span class="font3">). Many issues, however, make this comparison far from trivial: the texts&nbsp;are short (the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> only counts 500 words), we&nbsp;only know younger, potentially corrupted versions of&nbsp;the texts and rarely have autographs, the spelling of&nbsp;the material is highly unstable etc. We have tried to&nbsp;tackle the latter issue through part-of-speech tagging&nbsp;and lemmatizing the texts (Kestemont et al., 2016b):&nbsp;instead of performing measurements on the original&nbsp;surface forms, we would restrict our analyses to the&nbsp;most frequent tag-lemma pairs (MFTLPs), which normalize the spelling of tokens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, we will report several authorship experiments, using both the attribution and the verification setup (Kestemont et al., 2016a), in which we have compared the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> to a representative set of contemporary authors, among which the main candidate&nbsp;authors as well as some background authors that&nbsp;merely served as ‘distractors' or ‘imposters'. We include a small selection of these below. Surprisingly,&nbsp;these experiments without exception pointed towards&nbsp;an obscure, vilified author who has never even been&nbsp;mentioned as a candidate author: Petrus Dathenus (ca.&nbsp;1531-1588). The first series of plots are rather naive&nbsp;Principal Components analyses (300 MFTLPs) which&nbsp;each confront textual samples by two candidate authors and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> (in white). In these binary&nbsp;comparisons, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> is attributed to Dathenus&nbsp;without exception. The same goes for the verification&nbsp;experiment (which runs entirely parallel to the experiments run on the Caesarian corpus in Kestemont, et&nbsp;al. 2016a): when compared to both target and imposter authors, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> is significantly closer to&nbsp;Dathenus's texts than to any other candidate author&nbsp;from this period for which we have texts available.</span></p><div><img src="079_files/079-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:473pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0">Fig. 3: A late eighteenth century caricatural depiction of Petrus Dathenus with donkey ears, to symbolize his alleged&nbsp;poetical ignorance.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">Dathenus is primarily known as the author of a complete Dutch adaptation of the Psalms, which became extremely influential in the second half of the&nbsp;sixteenth (and which is in fact still sung today in some&nbsp;reformed communities). His contemporaries considered him a great and dangerous orator because of his&nbsp;convincing way with words. Nowadays, Datheen has&nbsp;the reputation of being a very poor poet. To what does&nbsp;he owe this bad reputation? Our present-day image of&nbsp;the man goes back to the late eighteenth century when&nbsp;the pressure grew to have his Psalm adaptation replaced by a more modern one in churches. In order to&nbsp;increase the pressure on Dathenus's Psalms, people&nbsp;started mocking the poet through the dissemination of&nbsp;caricatures in which the man would even be depicted&nbsp;with donkey ears (see Fig. 3). It is striking how&nbsp;strongly our present-day view of Dathenus is still determined by the highly anachronistic eighteenth image&nbsp;of this author, instead of that of the respected and influential individual he was known to be in his own&nbsp;time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, we will re-assess the sparse, historical evidence that is available for Petrus Dathenus and show that he is, in fact, an unusually strong authorial&nbsp;candidate for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3">. Here, we limit our discussion to a single new fact that recently emerged. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> is a so-called contrafact: the song has been&nbsp;composed by writing a new set of lyrics for an already&nbsp;existing melody, a very common practice in early modern song culture. The original melody which was used</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> was a French song: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">O la folle entreprise du Prince de Conde.</span><span class="font3"> Musicologist have been able to pinpoint when this song was created: it must have&nbsp;been composed (as a Protestant song) during the Siege&nbsp;of Chartres in 1568. The tune must have been introduced in the Low Countries via the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> and was&nbsp;not known beforehand. Therefore, it has always puzzled scholars how the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3"> author might have&nbsp;been exposed to this French tune. Intriguingly, it turns&nbsp;out that Dathenus must have been present at the Siege&nbsp;of Chartres as a field preacher on the protestant side.&nbsp;Thus, although he has never made it to the official candidate list, Dathenus is in fact the only candidate, who&nbsp;not only has the right stylistic profile, but of whom we&nbsp;also argue that he was directly exposed to the base&nbsp;tune of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelmus</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In our paper, we will not go as far as to claim that the neglect of Petrus Dathenus as a potential candidate&nbsp;author for the national anthem of the Netherlands has&nbsp;been an ideological ‘cover up operation'. We will discuss, however, the anachronistic biases and prejudices&nbsp;which so far have prevented the identification of&nbsp;Petrus Dathenus as a potential candidate author. From&nbsp;the point of Digital Humanities, it is important to stress&nbsp;that we base this research on a bold computational attribution to an author who, at first sight, seems a&nbsp;highly unlikely candidate; a human expert would&nbsp;never even have dared to think of this attribution. Nevertheless, exactly because machines do not carry the&nbsp;same set of preconceptions as humans, the application&nbsp;of stylometry is able to induce serendipity in humanities research and open up new perspectives.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
