<p><span class="font2">National Library of the Netherlands, the Netherlands</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 2015, an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and&nbsp;Belgium, based on the example of the American&nbsp;communal space of librarians, archivists, LIS graduate&nbsp;students, and information specialists to discuss topics&nbsp;‘Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet’. At&nbsp;the initial meeting it became apparent that most&nbsp;participants were there to learn more about digital&nbsp;humanities and were not (yet) in the situation where&nbsp;they were able to offer expertise on the subject. On the&nbsp;administrative level, the directors of the libraries&nbsp;participating in the consortium of Dutch academic&nbsp;libraries (UKB) also expressed the wish that librarians&nbsp;become more fluent in DH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A year later, the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek), and the&nbsp;University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam&nbsp;again concluded that librarians at their institutes who&nbsp;wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to&nbsp;adequately support researchers and students in this&nbsp;field. Therefore both institutes joined forces to&nbsp;develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians. The two&nbsp;institutes were later joined by the Leiden University&nbsp;Libraries. We see this as the ideal opportunity to&nbsp;provide these educative sessions not only to our own&nbsp;librarians, but also to the academic librarians of other&nbsp;Dutch research libraries. In essence, we want to teach&nbsp;our country’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order&nbsp;for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and&nbsp;supporting research and ideally become the research&nbsp;partner needed in DH projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in&nbsp;DH, for a diverse group of librarians, consisting of both&nbsp;subject and technical librarians with basic technical&nbsp;skills. The content of these sessions should enable&nbsp;them to provide services to researchers and students,&nbsp;identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that&nbsp;they could address by self-directed learning and&nbsp;(perhaps) to automate their daily library work. We are&nbsp;not setting out to turn them into programmers or data&nbsp;crunchers, but want to boost their knowledge level to&nbsp;where they feel comfortable providing information&nbsp;about DH projects, follow the literature and research,&nbsp;follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the&nbsp;challenge of finishing this professional development&nbsp;by engaging with the DH community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud-principle&nbsp;(Williams, 2010):</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desk research about what being a DH&nbsp;librarian entails (e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al.,&nbsp;2015; Mulligan, 2016; also see the Zotero&nbsp;library of the LIBER Digital Humanities&nbsp;working group);</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify possible subjects, based on&nbsp;experience, a comparison of existing&nbsp;teaching material related to DH (e.g. The&nbsp;Programming Historian, the Digital&nbsp;Scholarship Training Programme at the&nbsp;British Library and Columbia University's&nbsp;Developing Librarian project) and the&nbsp;TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get feedback from researchers on possible&nbsp;subjects, based on the knowledge and skills&nbsp;they feel librarians need;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get feedback from librarians on possible&nbsp;subjects, based on already known gaps in&nbsp;their knowledge and skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With these in hand, we will design the curriculum of clinics, based on the method of 'constructive&nbsp;alignment' (Biggs et al., 2011), to make sure that the&nbsp;intended learning objectives and the&nbsp;teaching/learning activities stay aligned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics, each one full day. Each day starts with one or more lectures&nbsp;by researchers, that address the conceptual&nbsp;knowledge needed. The afternoon sessions will be&nbsp;devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following&nbsp;the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible. By&nbsp;having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we&nbsp;hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the&nbsp;inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to&nbsp;provide access to a network within and across&nbsp;universities. With these clinics, we hope to initiate a&nbsp;stream of DH activities in Dutch universities, making&nbsp;access to support easier for new digital scholars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum, its position in the international context and offer the&nbsp;lessons learned from both the design process and the&nbsp;first clinics. We welcome discussion about our efforts&nbsp;and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></p>
