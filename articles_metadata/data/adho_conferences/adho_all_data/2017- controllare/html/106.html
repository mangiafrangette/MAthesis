<p><span class="font3">The ancient site of Selinunte (Sicily) is recognised today as one of the most important archaeological&nbsp;sites of the Greek period in Italy. From its foundation&nbsp;as a colony around the second half of the VII c.&nbsp;through to the middle of the III c. BCE, Selinunte enjoyed a prosperous existence as reflected in its notable sanctuaries, and temples. In 2006, the Institute of&nbsp;Fine Arts at New York University began a research&nbsp;project on the acropolis under the direction of Prof.&nbsp;C. Marconi and in collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Selinunte. The project consists of a new,&nbsp;systematic and interdisciplinary study of the archaeology and architecture of the main urban sanctuary,&nbsp;beginning with its southern sector. In the years between 2006 and 2012, the survey also consisted of&nbsp;the investigation of the ‘South Building'. This structure is notable for its prominent position within the&nbsp;sacred space. From the time of its discovery (1876),&nbsp;its scale has attracted scholarly attention, and the&nbsp;‘South Building' has played a significant role in discussions about the spatial articulation and cults of&nbsp;the main urban sanctuary. The investigation included a systematic programme of documenting the&nbsp;buildings in the area and its digital reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several elements suggest the identification of the ‘South Building' as an impressive theatral viewing&nbsp;area with particular acoustic qualities (Marconi and&nbsp;Scahill, 2015). This building belong to a group of the-atral structures found in various regions of the Greek&nbsp;world. Many of these structures were not proper&nbsp;“theatres”, but rather primitive rows of seats (meaning non-canonical theatres, with linear and non-circular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">theatra</span><span class="font3"> and/or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">orchestra</span><span class="font3">): they existed as “a&nbsp;place from where one could watch”, which is in fact&nbsp;the original meaning of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">theatron</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The quality of the stones was carefully selected in relation to their placement in the cultic theatres,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">based on structural, aesthetic, and, acoustic considerations. The acoustics of the linear </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">theatra</span><span class="font3"> in the Greek world have never been analysed (Blesser and&nbsp;Salter, 2011): no study has focused on the acoustics&nbsp;of these theatres in order to understand how and&nbsp;why these spaces were chosen for performance. It is&nbsp;a category of buildings brought to the attention of&nbsp;scholarship by Anti (1947), but first investigated in&nbsp;relation to religious contexts by Nielsen (2002) in&nbsp;her study on cultic theatres in the ancient world; by&nbsp;Marconi (2013) in his study on the theatral structure&nbsp;of Selinunte; and by Hollinshead (2015) in her study&nbsp;on the steps as components of monumental construction at Greek sites as early as the VI c. BCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Selinunte, the cultic theatre was built to accommodate spectators of performances associated primarily with Temple R, probably a temple of Demeter. One of the main striking finds among the votive&nbsp;depositions was the discovery of two parts of a bone&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aulos</span><span class="font3">, which can be dated to 570 BCE (Marconi,&nbsp;2014). This discovery is very significant, particularly&nbsp;with regard to the performance associated with the&nbsp;activity of Temple R (Marconi, 2013). The discovery&nbsp;shows the importance of music in this context which&nbsp;already existed in the Early Archaic period, that is,&nbsp;since its foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 2013, the Marie Curie Actions programme</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(IOF) funded the TELESTES project (622974): the main aim of this project was the reconstruction of&nbsp;musical development at Selinunte on the basis of material culture and written sources. It also included&nbsp;the study of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aulos</span><span class="font3"> from Temple R using a CT scan,&nbsp;an improved method for the visualisation and analysis of the instruments (Bellia, 2015). However, this&nbsp;survey still lacked an appropriate connection between the acoustics of the cultic theatre and musical&nbsp;activity related to the building. Thanks to the present&nbsp;project, auralisation techniques are used to explore&nbsp;the spatial dimension of sound in this cultic theatre,&nbsp;establishing a relationship between the spatial configuration of this structure and how this complements music. These data will help us to understand&nbsp;the aural perception of ancient peoples and the type&nbsp;of sound experiences they were exposed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This research is the first study on the virtual reconstruction of the acoustics of cultic theatres of the Greek world. Despite their relevance to the field of&nbsp;ancient music, no study has focused on the acoustics&nbsp;of these theatres in order to understand how and&nbsp;why these spaces were chosen for performance.&nbsp;Within this context, archaeoacoustics is being used&nbsp;as a new method for the analysis of historical heritage, enabling the evaluation of the sound quality of a&nbsp;space (Scarre and Graeme, 2006) by using auralisa-tion techniques which allow cognitive and physical&nbsp;elements to be reproduced and combined (Eneix,&nbsp;2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This project offers an innovative research method in the study of ancient Greek music, not only in its&nbsp;contextualisation of archaeological evidence, but&nbsp;also by making connections between digital and&nbsp;acoustic techniques. It is also hoped that the results&nbsp;will provide some foundations from which to create&nbsp;interpretative reconstructions of what the cultic theatres might have sounded like, using digital and&nbsp;acoustic technology. Moreover, this study will contribute towards overcoming the traditional methods&nbsp;in measuring ancient instruments, opening up a new&nbsp;disciplinary framework for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interaction between&nbsp;3D reconstruction of instruments, their respective&nbsp;sounds</span><span class="font3">, and the spaces of musical performances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to analyse the acoustic characteristics of the cultic theatre of Selinunte, an acoustic survey will&nbsp;be carried out using an impulsive sound source located in two positions on the steps, and in the “orchestra”. Measurements will be recorded using an&nbsp;impulsive sound source. This process will make it&nbsp;possible to obtain a virtual acoustic reconstruction&nbsp;of this space, including the incorporation of acoustic&nbsp;characteristics as another important aspect of its intangible heritage. The software used will be CATT-Acoustic, v. 9.0 c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The digitisation process of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aulos</span><span class="font3"> is divided into two main tasks, namely the 3D scanning phase&nbsp;and the post-processing phase. The tools we plan to&nbsp;develop are divided into those involving the use of&nbsp;computational methods for processing the 3D models, and those involving the development of interactive tools aimed at engaging in the exploration of the&nbsp;instruments. The software used will be GEOMAGIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">DESIGN X, with AVIZO, v. 9.0. Following the digital model will translated into artificial copies, using polymer as a material. We aim to obtain and to assess&nbsp;the auralisation of the acoustical properties of these&nbsp;3D models.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition, the work will address the study of written sources as well as visual and archaeological&nbsp;documentation related to music performed in the&nbsp;cultic theatres of the ancient Greek world from the&nbsp;Archaic through to the Classical periods. The study&nbsp;will be conducted in order to understand the reasons&nbsp;that led ancient cultures to create these spaces, as&nbsp;well as reconstruct how they experienced them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Expected results</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Firstly, this research will provide the first acoustic model for the study of acoustical properties of cultic&nbsp;theatres in the ancient Greek world. The study will&nbsp;assess and recover the acoustics of the Selinunte theatre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Secondly, the research will develop specific tools suitable for processing the resulting 3D models. It is&nbsp;also hoped that the results will provide some foundations from which to create experimental interpretative 3D reconstructions integrating acoustic models. The results will establish a new framework,&nbsp;which future researchers can use to advance their&nbsp;knowledge of the application of 3D technology for&nbsp;the documentation of instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, this project will offer an innovative research method in the study of ancient Greek music. This research aims to create a field of comparative&nbsp;studies of archaeomusicological research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In conclusion, this research will develop a new theoretical basis, which will contribute to the establishment of a methodology at the crossroads of ar-chaeomusicology, architecture, and acoustics and&nbsp;digital technologies. In addition, this study is part of&nbsp;a programme intended to valorise ancient cultural&nbsp;and musical heritage in the Mediterranean with&nbsp;cross-disciplinary approaches to human culture and&nbsp;technology, in order to unveil new meanings and create new research fields within the digital humanities&nbsp;and heritage science.</span></p>
