<p><span class="font2">Numerous innovations and inventions have been made by human beings in the past few millennia,&nbsp;providing the most important driving force for&nbsp;economic, social, and cultural developments.&nbsp;However, for thousands of years, credits for most of&nbsp;these innovations and inventions have been given to&nbsp;individual genius-inventors in almost all civilizations.&nbsp;While the Chinese credited the Yellow Emperor for the&nbsp;invention of the compass and Cai Lun for&nbsp;papermaking, the British and the Americans honored&nbsp;James Watts and Wright Brothers for the invention of&nbsp;the steam engine and aviation respectively. This&nbsp;genius-inventor approach dominated the history of&nbsp;innovation for centuries, partly because it was&nbsp;difficult, if not impossible, for both professional and&nbsp;amateur historians to access or process information&nbsp;beyond a limited number of individuals involved in&nbsp;those creative activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The predominant position of the genius-inventor approach has been challenged when computers and&nbsp;other technologies invented in recent decades&nbsp;drastically increased human capability in acquiring&nbsp;and processing large amounts of data. By taking&nbsp;advantage of these new innovations, some scholars&nbsp;began to reexamine various major innovations by&nbsp;expanding their scope to cover the complex&nbsp;interactions between genius-inventors and their&nbsp;peers. With this new approach, F. C. Moon discovered&nbsp;that many of those innovations were actually the&nbsp;products of extensive interactions between the well-recognized geniuses and large social networks around&nbsp;them. While shedding new light on many of the&nbsp;innovations done in the industrial age or earlier, this&nbsp;new genius-centered network paradigm still pays the&nbsp;most attention to the central role played by the geniusinventors. This tendency limits the paradigm’s ability&nbsp;to explain the numerous innovations and inventions&nbsp;made in the past century or so that did not involve any&nbsp;well-recognized individual geniuses. The invention of&nbsp;the liquid crystal display is one of those cases. Widely&nbsp;used in making TVs, computers, stationary and mobile&nbsp;phones, various control panels, billboards, watches,&nbsp;clocks, microwaves, and many other products that&nbsp;affect every aspect of our daily lives, the liquid crystal&nbsp;display was invented and improved by a large number&nbsp;of researchers who worked closely with their&nbsp;collaborators along the way. This absence of a single&nbsp;“genius inventor” in the development of the liquid&nbsp;crystal display and many other innovations calls for a&nbsp;new approach, one that will focus squarely on the&nbsp;large number of researchers who formed various&nbsp;networks that made those inventions possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paper approaches the invention of liquid crystal display from a new perspective. Instead of&nbsp;focusing on genius-inventors or genius-inventor&nbsp;centered networks, this study examines all the&nbsp;researchers at Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State&nbsp;University (LCIKSU) as nodes in an institutionalized&nbsp;network, and explores their interactions among&nbsp;themselves as well as with outside collaborators.&nbsp;LCIKSU is chosen not only because it is the largest&nbsp;research institute in the field that has made&nbsp;unparalleled and sustained contributions to the&nbsp;invention of liquid crystal display, but also because it&nbsp;has kept comprehensive institutional records since its&nbsp;inception, which makes it relatively easy to trace and&nbsp;analyze the growth and adaptation of this unique&nbsp;network of researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The examination of LCIKSU is based on extensive data drawn from various sources. The research group,&nbsp;whose members come from the disciplines of Library&nbsp;and Information Science, History, and Geography, has&nbsp;been given the access to all the available institutional&nbsp;records, including the LCIKSU annual reports, grant&nbsp;and patent applications, conference and exchange&nbsp;information, etc. All living directors of LCIKSU,&nbsp;incumbent as well as retired, have given long&nbsp;interviews, some meeting with the group multiple&nbsp;times. In addition, a large amount of data has been&nbsp;collected from various other sources such as the&nbsp;number of LCIKSU researchers’ publications from Web&nbsp;of Science, their grant awards from the National&nbsp;Science Foundation website, and their patent awards&nbsp;from ProQuest. With the help of various available data&nbsp;processing tools, usable information has been&nbsp;extracted from all these historical records and turned&nbsp;into smart data, which is then used to accurately&nbsp;measure the contributions made by LCIKSU to the&nbsp;invention of the liquid crystal display, and to decipher&nbsp;the secret of its success as a complex network of&nbsp;researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The careful study of the LCIKSU history reveals that the success achieved in the invention of liquid crystal&nbsp;display in the past fifty years has depended on the&nbsp;establishment and maintenance of a dynamic and&nbsp;productive network of researchers who collaborated&nbsp;closely with each other both within and beyond their&nbsp;own subfields or disciplines. Instead of looking for a&nbsp;genius inventor or becoming one themselves, the&nbsp;LCIKSU directors made every effort to recruit&nbsp;collaborating scientists to cover various sub-fields&nbsp;related with liquid crystal research. Some of the&nbsp;scientists, between a handful to a dozen over time,&nbsp;emerged as primary nodes in the network, producing&nbsp;the most paper publications, winning the most grants,&nbsp;and receiving the most patents. Usually leaders in their&nbsp;own subfields, these primary nodes not only worked&nbsp;with each other in conducting cutting-edge research,&nbsp;but also built their own sub-networks through various&nbsp;means and extended collaboration with other&nbsp;scientists throughout the university system, across the&nbsp;nation, and around the world. In order to better&nbsp;understand and illustrate the success of the LCIKSU&nbsp;researchers, the smart data collected on their papers&nbsp;published, grants received, and patents awarded is&nbsp;processed using various network analysis tools so that&nbsp;the degree and frequency of their collaboration can be&nbsp;measured and analyzed. The resulting assortativity,&nbsp;average clustering coefficient, degree centrality,&nbsp;closeness centrality, and between centrality indicators&nbsp;fully support the assessments made by individual&nbsp;researchers that the concentration of a large number&nbsp;of scientists, especially the primary nodes, at LCIKSU&nbsp;and the close collaboration among them have made it&nbsp;possible for these networked scientists to produce&nbsp;more and better research results at greater speed.&nbsp;After all, it is this sustained high level of research that&nbsp;has made LCIKSU the lead inventor of the liquid crystal&nbsp;display.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Joseph Schumpeter, one of the best-known economists in the 20th century, accurately observed in&nbsp;the early 1940s that technological progress was&nbsp;increasingly becoming the business of teams of trained&nbsp;specialists. However, team innovators who have&nbsp;played a growing role in innovation and invention&nbsp;have not received adequate attention. This&nbsp;examination of LCIKSU not only puts the researchers&nbsp;and their networks in the spotlight of the invention of&nbsp;the liquid crystal display, but also introduces a new&nbsp;approach that sharply focuses on the networks of&nbsp;scientists and extensively uses smart data. With&nbsp;further development and refinement, this new&nbsp;network-centered and smart-data-based approach&nbsp;has the potential to help narrow the existing gap in the&nbsp;study of modern history of innovation.</span></p>
