<p><span class="font1">In a poster session “Photogrammar and the Federal Writer's Project: A Model for Teaching Data and&nbsp;Mapping Rhetoric,” we outline the use of some of the&nbsp;educational opportunities we have discovered in using</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">large Digital Humanities projects to create</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">collaborative partnership pedagogies</span><span class="font1"> to teach students digital rhetoric. In this approach, students become</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">project managers serving the needs of a real world research client - Yale University, the University of&nbsp;North Carolina, Chapel Hill and the University of&nbsp;Richmond's collaborative Photogrammar team.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bringing together pedagogical theories in Composition and Rhetoric that stress the importance&nbsp;of understanding the role of rhetoric in the&nbsp;construction of digital texts (Sayers, Sample,&nbsp;Galloway) and strategies for equitable collaborative&nbsp;practices in Digital Humanities (Posner and AlgeeHewitt), we teach students to “critically make data” by&nbsp;becoming project leaders tasked with textual mark-up&nbsp;and metadata creation using digitized archival&nbsp;documents. As team leaders, students must think&nbsp;through key rhetorical issues involving naming&nbsp;practices, organizational practices, and user interface&nbsp;and access with a mind toward both historical&nbsp;authenticity and greater inclusion. In this way, they&nbsp;participate robustly in contemporary real world&nbsp;debates about civility, discourse, history and&nbsp;accountability in naming persons, events and things.&nbsp;Therefore, this pedagogical approach opens access&nbsp;into the center of current pedagogical and historical&nbsp;concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Photogrammar project brings together photographs by the Farm Security Administration&nbsp;taken during the Great Depression and World War II&nbsp;with life histories created through Federal Writers'&nbsp;Project. The new tools currently in development will&nbsp;offer users the opportunity to search and map both the&nbsp;visual and textual histories of the Great Depression in&nbsp;relation to each other. These life histories hold great&nbsp;historical significance as they mark an important&nbsp;precursor to the development of oral history&nbsp;methodology by collecting the histories of people who&nbsp;were previously excluded from the historical record,&nbsp;including women, the working class, and African&nbsp;Americans (Couch, Hirsch, Penkower). Since they will&nbsp;function in some sense as extended captions to the&nbsp;FSA/OWI photographs, adding the life histories also&nbsp;touches upon important issues in the history and&nbsp;criticism of visual culture. Additionally, they hold&nbsp;linguistic keys to racial, gender, class, sexuality and&nbsp;location classification patterns of the time that the&nbsp;photographs alone may not expose. Ethical as well as&nbsp;methodological issues in bringing buried histories to&nbsp;light vividly arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Applying collaborative partnership pedagogies in an undergraduate course in Composition, Rhetoric&nbsp;and Digital Literacy at the University of North Carolina&nbsp;that had no prerequisites, students were tasked to&nbsp;create a metadata schema for the life histories to be&nbsp;added to Photogrammar, using TEI to create rules for&nbsp;encoding the text. Because most students entered the&nbsp;class with little technological or collaborative skills,&nbsp;the course places students in small working groups&nbsp;and used Trello (project management software) to&nbsp;organize work flows for lower stake exercises&nbsp;designed to address larger theoretical issues in digital&nbsp;rhetoric (Eyman, Hart-Davidson, Ridolfo). These small&nbsp;stakes activities helped students develop the skills&nbsp;necessary to tackle the larger project that required&nbsp;them to work through critical issues of power&nbsp;stemming from the task of making archival material&nbsp;from the 1930's useful in a digital setting today. For&nbsp;instance, some of the language used to classify racial&nbsp;groups in the FSA and the Federal Workers Project is&nbsp;off-putting, or even offensive today. Students had to&nbsp;come to consensus on such difficult issues because the&nbsp;project required that they present (via skype) their&nbsp;rationale for the metadata schema to a Photogrammar&nbsp;Co-Director. The Co-Director then gave feedback,&nbsp;which students used to write their schema rationale&nbsp;within the TEI of the archival documents. Their&nbsp;decisions did an excellent job of balancing the need to&nbsp;maintain the historical authenticity of the documents&nbsp;while using technology in the service of great inclusion&nbsp;and social justice are now used as the template for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">entire life histories collection. Therefore, they not only learned crucial transferable digital skills, but also were&nbsp;given the ability to contribute materially to how the&nbsp;historical record is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the students' work, it will be possible to map the movement of interviewers, trace the&nbsp;prevalence of important issues of the time such as&nbsp;sharecropping, women's labor, WPA work, and mill&nbsp;work, and generate comparative analyzes of rhetoric&nbsp;used via specific interviewer practices. This project&nbsp;highlights the new kinds of classroom as well as&nbsp;scholarly opportunities that arise when rhetorical&nbsp;questions and insights begin to allow students to&nbsp;direct and inflect the further development and buildout process of an established DH site.</span></p>
