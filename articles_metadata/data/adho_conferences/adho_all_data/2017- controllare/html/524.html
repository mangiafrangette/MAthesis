<p><span class="font3">The field of the digital humanities has broadened substantially in the last few years, and this expansion&nbsp;has, in its turn, intensified debates about digital diversity and accessibility. These debates have emerged&nbsp;from the realization that, in spite of the euphoria created by visions of a &quot;flat&quot; digital landscape with access&nbsp;for all, the results to date do not measure up to such&nbsp;expectations. New associations with languages and academic methodologies that differ from those of the&nbsp;global North are promoting initiatives to investigate&nbsp;questions of access to technologies associated with the&nbsp;digital humanities. Despite these contributions by organizations such as the Post Colonial Digital Humanities (DHPoCo), FemTech.Net, Transform DH, GO:DH,&nbsp;Associa^ao das Humanidades Digitais, etc., the issue of&nbsp;making the digital humanities more diverse and more&nbsp;accessible remains a problem of concern. Questions&nbsp;about race and ethnicity, and about the very material&nbsp;foundations —people, geographies, and tools— that&nbsp;make the digital possible are sometimes lost in discussions about how the digital domain is constituted and&nbsp;distributed across the globe. Therefore, the possibilities, or lack thereof, for taking advantage of digital resources and digital connectivity by people who have&nbsp;been, and continue to be, under-represented in the&nbsp;digital humanities remains to be a topic of some urgency. More conversations are needed across the digital humanities to address and bridge this gap, and to&nbsp;propose more productive ways of thinking about the&nbsp;impact, benefits, and drawbacks of the digital domain&nbsp;as it becomes an increasingly important layer of our&nbsp;cultural and social lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is in the spirit of examining what we have been alluding to as a digital gap that our panel brings together specialists and practitioners of the digital humanities to discuss specific issues in countries and&nbsp;communities that have traditionally been at the periphery of normative cultural representations in various parts of the southern Americas. How are Afro-Latin American and Afrolatin@ communities using&nbsp;methodologies associated with the digital humanities&nbsp;to advance their own goals? How do current digital&nbsp;tools as applied to curatorial projects, archives, and&nbsp;the dissemination of information allow these same&nbsp;communities to explore hidden histories and propose&nbsp;new images and (self-) representations? What kind of&nbsp;digital resources —whether in terms of big-data or&nbsp;minimal computing— are these communities using to&nbsp;intervene in debates about the current state, and the&nbsp;future, of the digital domain? These are some of the&nbsp;fundamental questions inextricably tied to problems&nbsp;of accessibility that our panel will address by means of&nbsp;specific case studies. The diversity of methodologies&nbsp;we will bring to the conversation becomes a strength&nbsp;that productively challenges rigid limits on how the&nbsp;digital humanities are to be defined, which is particularly important when inclusion is at stake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The session itself will consist of a brief introduction by the panel organizers explaining the rationale for the&nbsp;choice of papers and how these shed light on issues of&nbsp;accessibility in the digital humanities. This will be followed by three presentations, two of which will be in&nbsp;English and one in Spanish (María Cecilia Martino):</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">International Organization Theory (IO) and Online Afro-Latin America</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yvonne Captain</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This presentation will discuss the connection between International Organization Theory, Digital Humanities and the connection of diverse Afro-Latin American political, social and cultural organizations.&nbsp;Professor Captain will show how, using digital tools to&nbsp;reach out to global communities, organizations such as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Afroféminas [a Spanish/Latin American organization] help new identities emerge and connect productively.&nbsp;Her paper will hone in on the work of Afro-Costa Rican&nbsp;poet </span><span class="font0">Shirley Barr Campbell</span><span class="font3">, who connects to a variety&nbsp;of organizations via digital tools as a way to draw&nbsp;larger audiences and start discussing what it means to&nbsp;be a citizen of the Diaspora. Her paper focuses on how&nbsp;the advent of digital networks has impacted the formation, membership and digital appropriation of organization that have existed and connected well before our digital boom. In addition, she considers those&nbsp;organizations that have failed in connecting themselves digitally as examples that “proffer a cautionary&nbsp;lesson on what not to do” and as examples on how to&nbsp;handle digital waste.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Towards the Organization of an Afro-descendant Digital Archive in the Cape Verdean Association</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Maria Cecilia Martino</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This presentation focuses on the experience of an association of Cape Verdean migrants to Buenos Aires&nbsp;(Argentina) in organizing information by means of a&nbsp;digital archive. In her paper, Mrs. Martino discusses issues of access to technology, the creation of a basic&nbsp;system of metadata and the connection between members of the community based on materials such as photographs, videos, and documents that tell the story of&nbsp;migration and resilience of Cape Verdeans immigrants&nbsp;to Buenos Aires. Finally, her paper will discuss how&nbsp;digital methodologies would help enrich ethnographic&nbsp;practices concerned with representing people's discourse.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Afrolatin@ Digital Humanities</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eduard Arriaga</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The final presentation discusses projects carried out by and about Afrolatin@ and Afro-Latin American&nbsp;communities in the Americas, questioning the very&nbsp;definition of Digital Humanities in order to include&nbsp;such initiatives. By analyzing the studied projects, this&nbsp;paper questions conceptions of humanity, humanities,&nbsp;access and digital appropriation residing at the core of&nbsp;current digital humanities projects and put to test by&nbsp;Afrolatin@ and Afro-Latin American endeavors. Finally, the paper reviews some of the principles of the&nbsp;minimal computing approach to identify its limits, advantages and impacts in Afrolatin@ digital projects.</span></p>
