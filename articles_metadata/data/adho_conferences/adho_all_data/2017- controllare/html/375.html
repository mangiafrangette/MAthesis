<p><span class="font1">In Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep the U.N. secretary proclaims, “[m]ankind needs&nbsp;more empathy” (1968). The poignancy of Dick’s novel&nbsp;is its accurate expression of the social challenge of&nbsp;diminishing human empathy. The author offers&nbsp;empathy as the defining characteristic of humanity. As&nbsp;is often the case, science fiction foreshadows our&nbsp;future: longitudinal studies show decreasing rates of&nbsp;empathy in college students over the last three&nbsp;decades. If we believe that empathy is indeed a vital&nbsp;quality, then humanists are uniquely qualified to&nbsp;address this decline: extensive research suggests that&nbsp;empathy can be taught, specifically by reading fiction.&nbsp;Furthermore, preliminary trials indicate that virtual&nbsp;reality (VR) effectively evokes feelings of empathy in&nbsp;viewers. In both cases, the medium can provide the&nbsp;audience with access to situations outside of their&nbsp;everyday experience, offering a perspective into the&nbsp;lives of people unfamiliar to the reader/viewer. Take,&nbsp;for example, the work of documentary filmmaker&nbsp;Chris Milk that immerses the viewer in war torn&nbsp;villages in order to impact immigration policy (see&nbsp;“How virtual reality can create the ultimate empathy&nbsp;machine,” 2016) or the content of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New York Times&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">VR application which addresses a wide variety of&nbsp;social justice issues from all over the world. However,&nbsp;as critics such at Janet Murray rightfully argue, the&nbsp;impact of VR is dependent on the execution, which is&nbsp;still in development stages: “[t]he technical&nbsp;adventurism and grubby glamour of working in&nbsp;emerging technologies can make it hard to figure out&nbsp;what is good or bad from what is just new” (“Not a Film&nbsp;and Not an Empathy Machine,” 2016). As the digital&nbsp;humanities have encountered with other emerging&nbsp;technologies - most notably data visualization&nbsp;techniques - these new forms need to be critiqued as&nbsp;they evolve (Drucker, 2012). Inviting students and&nbsp;educators to collaborate with industry professionals&nbsp;in the process of consuming, critiquing, and creating&nbsp;open access VR content creates the opportunity to&nbsp;design thoughtful immersive experiences that may&nbsp;address the decline in empathy in college age students.&nbsp;This presentation will explicate a study-in-progress&nbsp;devised to measure the pedagogical impact of VR&nbsp;content in combination with design thinking&nbsp;assignments used to combat desensitization and&nbsp;evoke empathy across the disciplines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This research is supported with a case study of students in a series of linked courses at a small liberal&nbsp;arts college in Baltimore, MD. Students were exposed&nbsp;to VR content intended to increase their feelings of&nbsp;empathy for people who represent the “Other” in&nbsp;various ways, such as gender, race, ethnicity, and&nbsp;social class. This study was created through a crosscampus collaboration between faculty from the&nbsp;humanities, social sciences, and school of design&nbsp;alongside the theater director and librarians. Using&nbsp;empathy as the central question, each course&nbsp;integrated VR content and related readings into the&nbsp;curriculum. In each case, VR provided access to&nbsp;experiences not possible within the classroom space,&nbsp;for example an immersion into a refugee camp, a&nbsp;simulation of the human brain, and a documentary&nbsp;depicting gender bias across cultural contexts. The VR&nbsp;was scaffolded into each course in discipline-specific&nbsp;ways. For instance, the literature courses focused on&nbsp;readings that depict representations of virtual bodies&nbsp;in tandem with theory on posthumanism, particularly&nbsp;the work of Katherine Hayles and Donna Haraway. At&nbsp;the same time, the theater program produced </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Nether</span><span class="font1"> by Jennifer Haley, which raises questions about&nbsp;the laws governing virtual spaces through depictions&nbsp;of pederasty and the murder of young children.&nbsp;Simultaneously, courses in psychology and human&nbsp;services integrated VR to discuss the impact of&nbsp;immersive content on social justice reform, and&nbsp;nursing courses looked at the application of VR for&nbsp;patient care and education. To varying degrees, this&nbsp;work was supplemented with readings on feminism,&nbsp;race theory, and disability studies in order to support&nbsp;discussions of “othering” with students. After&nbsp;analyzing the VR content in conjunction with the&nbsp;course materials, students were asked to design a VR&nbsp;experience intended to evoke empathy in the context&nbsp;of a discipline-specific audience. Additionally,&nbsp;members of a local VR company contributed as guest&nbsp;speakers and offered internships for interested&nbsp;students. Surveys were distributed at the beginning&nbsp;and end of the semester that prompted students to&nbsp;define, discuss, and debate empathy. At the end of each&nbsp;course students were interviewed to identify which&nbsp;methods of engagement increased their empathy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">toward people (in some cases characters) they felt were unlike themselves in significant ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a part of this submission the syllabi and assignments will be shared. Ideally, the speaker will&nbsp;bring a VR headset and gaming laptop so participants&nbsp;can experience and consider how this emerging&nbsp;technology can evoke empathy by providing access to&nbsp;geographical, cultural, political, and biological content&nbsp;unfamiliar to the viewer. The goal is to receive&nbsp;audience feedback on the first stage of this study in&nbsp;order to improve and refine the methods before&nbsp;executing the plan on a larger scale. This study is IRB&nbsp;approved and student consent will be obtained for any&nbsp;student work that is presented.</span></p>
