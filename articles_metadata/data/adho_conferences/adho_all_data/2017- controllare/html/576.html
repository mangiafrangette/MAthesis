<p><span class="font4">The Digital Humanities Summer Institute, or DHSI, provides “an ideal environment for discussing and&nbsp;learning about new computing technologies and how&nbsp;they are influencing teaching, research, dissemination,&nbsp;creation, and preservation in different disciplines, via&nbsp;a community-based approach” (DHSI). What began in&nbsp;2001 as a small event at Malaspina University-College&nbsp;is now an annual 2-week affair at the University of Victoria which offers dozens of sessions and attracts a&nbsp;global audience. The growth of DHSI over the past 16&nbsp;years mirrors the larger development of digital humanities as an academic (inter)discipline that has&nbsp;shifted from a niche endeavor for computational linguists and technology early-adopters to both a mainstream methodological approach and a distributed&nbsp;community of practitioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> examines DHSI attendance data. This website functions both as a tool for research&nbsp;about DHSI (and thus the history of disciplinary training in the digital humanities), and as a platform for&nbsp;DHSI alumni to connect with other researchers with&nbsp;similar interests, or to reconnect with contacts from&nbsp;previous DHSI sessions. In this way, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> intersects with the “Collaborators” component of center-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Net's excellent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DH Commons</span><span class="font4"> website, but is more explicitly focused on the distributed community of DHSI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">alumni.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The DHSI organizational team maintains an archive of past DHSI sessions and participants. With the permission of DHSI and the Electronic Textual Cultures&nbsp;Laboratory at University of Victoria, I scraped this collection and cleaned it with OpenRefine to remove typographical errors, standardize attendee and organization names, and validate the data. There is no participant data (only instructors) for 2001-2003, but since&nbsp;2004 there is an accurate list matching every attendee&nbsp;to the session he or she attended. This information is&nbsp;further broken out by role - student, instructor,&nbsp;speaker, or staff, with numerous specific subcategories of each. From 2006 onward, attendee institutional&nbsp;and organizational affiliations are also included. I also&nbsp;built a controlled vocabulary of DH topics and manually added topics to each session based on the session&nbsp;title and abstract when available. Together, these components form a temporal, topical, spatial, and biographical dataset which captures the attendance data&nbsp;for 2,678 individuals who collectively attended 254&nbsp;sessions across 4,932 instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> allows users to access and interpret this dataset. Researchers can access the raw data via a&nbsp;JSON endpoint, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> also features numerous interactive interfaces which provide intuitive&nbsp;ways to understand the growth of DHSI through what&nbsp;Joanna Drucker calls “visual epistemologies ... ways of&nbsp;knowing that are presented and processed visually”&nbsp;(2014, 8). These include a searchable table of all participants; charts of the growth of DHSI over time by&nbsp;country, and by total institutional attendance; a facetable map of participants' institutional affiliations; a&nbsp;graph which examines the popularity of DHSI session&nbsp;topics and when they were introduced (figure 1); and&nbsp;a searchable network graph of participants, linked by&nbsp;session attendance, scaled by frequency, and color-coded by participant role. These and other visualizations provide information about the growth of an international DH and DHSI constituency, identify major&nbsp;contributors and organizations within the field, and</span></p><div><img src="576_files/576-1.jpg" style="width:295pt;height:166pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: Topics assigned to DHSI sessions, colored by year introduced and sized by frequency</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> also helps users connect with fellow DHSI alumni and find potential collaborators. For example, users interested in organizing a maker fair&nbsp;could query the database for DHSI alumni within 200&nbsp;miles who attended a session between 2010 and 2016</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and are interested in the topics of “3D printing,” “augmented / virtual reality,” “physical computing,” or “maker culture and praxis.” While “interests” are currently established by proxy via a link to attended session topics, the accuracy of such a search will increase&nbsp;over time because users can claim their profile on the&nbsp;site via an opt-in process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once a user claims his or her profile, he or she can edit their institutional affiliations; research interests;&nbsp;projects, papers, or personal websites; and/or contact&nbsp;information (Twitter / email). Users are also able to&nbsp;quickly opt-out of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> and anonymize their&nbsp;attendance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> is designed for eventual&nbsp;expansion based on the availability of additional data&nbsp;sources such as lists of members or participants in&nbsp;THATCamps, HASTAC, HILT, European Summer University, DH@Madrid, DHOxSS, and conferences such&nbsp;as ADHO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This poster presentation will allow ADHO attendees to test </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4">. As the creator and developer of the project, I will be able to answer any questions about </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DHConnections</span><span class="font4"> and the underlying&nbsp;dataset, and look forward to talking to users and gathering feedback to help improve the platform.</span></p>
