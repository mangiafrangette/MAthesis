                    <head>Introduction</head>
                    <p>Noh is a classical Japanese stage art consisting of singing and dancing with
                        musical accompaniment. The song lyrics have been documented and are known as
                        Noh texts. It is generally accepted that there are 240 songs, which are
                        still performed today. However, some academic scholars claim that there are
                        more than 500 Noh texts in existence. The texts take on different forms
                        depending on the Noh school and the era in which they were edited.</p>
                    <p>Very little analyses have been carried out on Noh texts by applying
                        mathematical methods. Therefore, in previous studies, Noh text was analyzed
                        by identifying the authors of each Noh play using mathematical methods. This
                        study employed mathematical and statistical methods to analyze 21 songs
                        including worrier play category from Noh plays. Specific usage within
                        lexical categories (auxiliary verb, adjective) was identified. As in Noh
                        play, there are manuscripts which differ by the Noh school and the era being
                        edited, the manuscripts under study need to be chosen adequately. Therefore,
                        it is necessary to trace the history of each Noh text using phylogenetic
                        analysis. At the same time, one has to be aware of the differences between
                        engineering and literary approaches.</p>

                    <head>Purpose of research</head>
                    <p>The purpose of this research is to establish a new methodology in Noh field
                        by employing mathemathecal and stylometric techniques. First, data is
                        collected from various research materials and a database is constructed that
                        facilitates preliminary analyses to verify items in the collected data or to
                        draw a complete map for further studies. Practical analyses directly
                        connected to interpretations are based on the preliminary analyses.
                        Although, in Japan, these processes are common in both engineering and
                        literary approaches, attitudes to analyses are completely different. In
                        engineering approaches, final conclusions are derived from practical
                        analyses. In contrast, in literary approaches, analyses and interpretations
                        are essentially synonymous and interpretive understanding is given more
                        importance than scientifically based analyses. Therefore the discussions
                        with other fields, such as information science, are required in each
                        research process. Additionally, linguistic and cultural barriers make
                        foreign researchers to spend a lot of time and care on understanding the
                        research materials. Standing on this point, versatile methodology not to
                        depend on researchers’ skills of language is required. Normalized
                        Compression Distance (NCD) method, the author focused on in this paper,
                        calculates similarity of texts objects by using compression algorithm
                        without any knowledge about the research materials.</p>

                        <p>Tamaki Yano (2005)</p>
                        <p>Tamaki Yano applied Phylogenetic methods to collections of traditional
                            Japanese ‘waka’ poems edited in 1215 [1]. The term ‘waka’ is a form of
                            poem handed down from ancient times in Japan. The research materials had
                            some versions that departed from the original, and the research aimed to
                            identify an archetype for the differing collections. In this study, the
                            genealogy of each collection is visualized by neighbor-net, a
                            distance-based method for constructing phylogenetic networks that is
                            based on the neighbor-joining algorithm of Saitou and Nei [2]. </p>

                        <p>Yuka Iemura, Yu Fujimoto (2010)</p>
                        <p>In Iemura and Fujimoto’s research, NCD was used to calculate the
                            similarity distance because of its simplicity. Suppose, for instance,
                            there are two files named ‘x’ and ‘y,’ C(xy) is the compressed size for
                            the concatenation of files ‘x’ and ‘y.’ C(x) denotes the compressed size
                            of ‘x’ and C(y) denotes that of ‘y.’ Fujimoto and Iemura attempted to
                            apply this method to XML documents and the results were visualized using
                            neighbor-net. They concluded that the results properly reflected
                            differences between each XML document [3].</p>

                    <p>This study examined <hi rend="italic">Tadanori</hi> (<foreign>忠度</foreign>), one of the 240
                        existing songs. <hi rend="italic">Tadanori</hi> is one of the oldest
                        accessible manuscripts, and anyone can browse the full version of the
                        photocopied manuscript. In addition, this masterpiece is popular even now,
                        and thus, there is a considerable relevant material that makes it possible
                        to trace the history of the Noh texts (Table 1). Eleven different <hi
                            rend="italic">Tadanori</hi> manuscripts were transcribed as data files.
                        The size column in Table 1 shows the byte size of the manuscripts.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">A. NCD</hi></p>
                        <p>To create text files for NCD, all kanjis were converted to Japanese
                            hiragana using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).</p>
                        <p>NCD was calculated by Hyakka-One, which is a NCD calculating software
                            developed by Fujimoto. The software currently supports zip, gzip, and
                            bzip algorithms. General zip compression was used in this study.
                            Although the original advocates of NCD recommend the quartet method for
                            clustering, neighbor-net was used to visualize the genealogy of Noh-hon.
                            The distance matrix calculated by Hyakka-One was exported to
                            phylogenetic tree software, Splits Tree4, and visualized as a
                            phylogenetic network called a neighbor-net. The neighbor-net derived
                            from the NCD matrix is presented in Figure1. </p>
   
                <p><hi rend="italic">B. Phylogenetic approach</hi></p>
                        <p>The phylogenetic approach involves two methods. The first is a method for
                            detecting differences between each group of phrases and calculating
                            distances for a phylogenetic tree. The second, which is used to verify
                            the results of the NCDs, is based on the maximum parsimony method.
                            PAUP*4.0 software was used for this verification in this study. PAUP* is
                            commonly used in cladistics or phylogenetics. To apply the second
                            method, data cleaning is required to conflate each Noh text and extract
                            the different phrases, make groups of phrases, and replace the groups
                            with single letters. The process of separating Noh texts into phrases is
                            not required by the NCD method. The methods provide different results
                            based on differences between phrases. PAUP* returned 841 results.
                            Although the lengths of edges are shorter than the NCD results, they are
                            similar. These result were integrated using super-network and the
                            integrated results were displayed using Splits Tree4.</p>
                    </div>
                <div>
                    <head>Results </head>
                    <p>Three results were obtained by the distance
                        method by SplitsTree4 (Figure 2), the Super-Network by the maximum parsimony
                        trees (Figure 3), and the distance method by NCD  (Figure 1). In all three
                        results, the kp and kz groups are apparently separated. This means the texts
                        can be categorized according to schools. With regard to hs_1979, all three
                        networks show that hs_1979 is closer to the kz group. Related to the forms
                        of performance, it is generally accepted in the Noh community that the hs
                        group and the kz group are part of the same group, while kp belongs to other
                        groups that were not included in this study. Therefore, these three results
                        support the generally accepted ideas. Although NCD tends to be criticized
                        because of the difficulty involved in verifying the results, in this study,
                        the NCD approach gives enough results on grouping and can be applied to
                        preliminary analysis. The advantage of NCD is the simplicity of its data
                        cleaning process. Because of this simplicity, foreign researchers who are
                        not fully familiar with the Japanese language or researchers of literature
                        and have a limited knowledge of engineering can handle the data. The other
                        two methods require familiarity with both Japanese and engineering. NCD has
                        a disadvantage for the practical analysis stage. Because NCD depends on a
                        complex compression algorithm, it is difficult to perform verification using
                        the original texts.</p>
                </div>
            <div>
                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>The NCD approach has been successfully applied to Noh research. In this
                        initial study, the results from the NCD method were not significantly
                        different from the other two common methods, and it is reasonable to
                        conclude that the NCD method can support traditional Noh studies equally as
                        well as the other two methods. In future research, the author will attempt
                        to apply NCD to other Noh plays and determine if it is valid to use the
                        method for preliminary analysis. It is acknowledged that it will be
                        necessary to develop database schemas that can potentially generate text
                        plans for calculating NCD.</p>
