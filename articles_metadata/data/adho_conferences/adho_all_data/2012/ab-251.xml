                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The Placenames Database of Ireland is a bilingual database which records the
                    official names in Irish and English of geographical objects on the island of
                    Ireland. The database contains over 100,000 entries, is accessible to the public
                    for free (<ref target="www.logainm.ie" type="external">www.logainm.ie</ref>) and serves around 150,000
                    searches per month.</p>
                <p>The public-facing website was launched in 2008 in the context of recently enacted
                    legislation which gave more prominence to Irish-language placenames in the
                    Republic of Ireland; for details on the legal and sociolinguistic situation of
                    placenames in Ireland see Mac Giolla Easpaig (2008, 2009). For more insights
                    into the history and role of placenames in Ireland, see Mac Mathúna (1990).</p>
                <p>We will not attempt to describe the structure of the Placenames Database of
                    Ireland holisticly here. Instead, we will concentrate on three sub-areas where
                    interesting challenges have arisen. In many cases, the issues presented here are
                    issues that have not been solved satisfactorily in our database yet, or a
                    solution has not been implemented yet. In this sense, the paper is merely a
                    discussion of issues rather than a catalogue of solutions.</p>

            <div>
                <head>Linguistic properties of placenames</head>
                <p>Placenames databases differ in how much attention they pay to the linguistic
                    properties of the names themselves, such as their gender, inflection and so on.
                    Multilingual databases such as Geonames usually ignore such aspects completely.
                    Smaller databases, however, often focus on only one or two languages and are
                    conceived mainly as a <hi rend="italic">lexical</hi> database rather than a <hi
                        rend="italic">geographic</hi> one. Linguistic properties relevant to
                    placenames can be broadly subdivided into the following three areas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Internal structure.</hi> Practically all placenames that consist
                    of more than one word have an implicit internal structure, just like other
                    linguistic expressions. Some aspects of this structure may need to be made
                    explicit in a database. These include definite articles and other textual
                    phenomena that get in the way of alphabetical sorting including initial
                    mutations in Celtic languages; composite names such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ballaghgowla and Froghan</hi>; and names with disambiguators such as <hi
                        rend="italic">Black Lough (South)</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Combinatorial properties.</hi> These are linguistic properties
                    relevant to how the placename interacts with the text in which it is being used
                    and include language-specific features such as gender, grammatical number and
                    inflection paradigms. In addition, the following combinatorial properties are
                    relevant to placenames in particular: how the name can be combined with
                    categorizers such as ‘town’ or ‘county’ (<hi rend="italic">Donegal <hi
                            rend="italic">Town</hi></hi> but <hi rend="italic"><hi
                            rend="italic">County</hi> Donegal</hi>); which locative prepositions
                    are combined with the placename (<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"
                        >i</hi> nGaillimh</hi> ‘in Galway’ but <hi rend="italic"><hi
                            rend="italic">ar</hi> an gCeathrú Rua</hi> ‘in Carrarow’, literally
                    ‘on Carrarow’).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Lexical relations</hi> to other words in the language and to
                    other placenames. The former include demonyms (terms for ‘people from’) and
                    derived adjectives which are sometimes irregular. The latter include cases where
                    one geographical object has been named after another, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ballybeg Road</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lismore Terrace</hi>.</p>
            </div>
                <div>
                    <head>Cross-linguistic issues</head>
                <p>A separate cluster of issues stems from the fact that the Placenames Database of
                    Ireland is bilingual. This does not seem to pose a challenge at first; the
                    general principle is that every place has two names, one in each language, and
                    this seems to call for a simple data structure: all we need is two text fields.
                    However, that approach would fail to account for the following phenomena.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Borrowing and gaps. </hi>Sometimes, a place has the same name in
                    both languages. An example is an area of Dublin called <hi rend="italic">Dún
                        Laoghaire</hi>. This is an Irish name which is also used in English with
                    unchanged spelling (but with anglicised pronunciation). An obvious solution
                    would be to simply record <hi rend="italic">Dún Laoghaire</hi> twice, once as an
                    Irish name and once as an English name. However, this is unsatisfactory as it
                    fails to account for the fact that this name is not really <hi rend="italic">in
                    </hi>English, it is merely <hi rend="italic">used </hi>in English.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, in some strongly Irish-speaking areas, minor features such as
                    crossroads, fields and wells only have Irish names and there are no known
                    English names. One can only assume that if somebody needed to refer to such a
                    place while speaking English, one would briefly code-switch into Irish to utter
                    the name.</p>
                <p>A fairly granular data structure is called for here, one that allows us to
                    capture facts as to whether a name in a given language exists or not, whether
                    the name <hi rend="italic">used </hi>in a given language is also a name <hi
                        rend="italic">in</hi> that language, and whether the name has been borrowed
                    from another language. </p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Anglicisation, translation and re-interpretation.</hi> Many
                    English placenames in Ireland have been obtained from the original Irish names
                    by a process of writing down an approximated pronunciation (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Gaoth Dobhair</hi> -> <hi rend="italic">Gweedore</hi>). In other cases,
                    when the English name was created first, the method used to coin the Irish name
                    has often been translation, such as <hi rend="italic">Butler’s Bridge</hi> ->
                        <hi rend="italic">Droichead an Bhuitléaraigh</hi>. In other cases still, the
                    Irish and English names are independent coinages (example: <hi rend="italic"
                        >Loch Garman/Wexford</hi>).</p>
                <p>Translation is sometimes accompanied by re-interpretation. An example of this is
                    an area of Dublin called <hi rend="italic">Barra an Teampaill/Temple
                    Bar.</hi>The placename originated in English from the personal name <hi
                        rend="italic">Temple</hi> but was later re-interpreted as the common noun
                        <hi rend="italic">temple</hi> and hence the Irish name (literally ‘the bar
                    of the temple’). Although based on a misunderstanding, it was decided to keep
                    the Irish name as official because it is commonly used.</p>
                <p>An ideal data structure would allow us to record these and other etymological
                    relations between names of the same place in different languages. If such
                    relations are explicated and annotated in the database, then we can not only
                    provide better information to users but also extract interesting statistical
                    observations about the relative proportion of these phenomena in the country’s
                    body of placenames.</p></div>
                    <div><head>Dealing with overlapping hierarchies</head>
                <p>Most countries are subdivided into administrative units such as districts,
                    provinces or counties. These units form a hierarchy and such hierarchies are
                    deliberately designed as a <hi rend="italic">nested hierarchy</hi> to disallow
                    overlapping and facilitate reasoning.</p>
                <p>In Ireland, the situation is far from this computational ideal. The basic units
                        (<hi rend="italic">counties -> baronies -> civil parishes -> townlands</hi>)
                    may have originally been designed as a nested hierarchy but are no longer so
                    because of boundary changes that have not been propagated up and down the
                    hierarchy and because of the introduction of competing hierarchies which overlap
                    with the traditional system.</p>
                <p>The consequence when building a placenames database is that we must work with an
                        <hi rend="italic">overlapping hierarchy</hi> where a child may have more
                    than one parent. This complicates things; for example, reasoning is no longer
                    always possible. If we know that A is in B and that B is in C1 and C2
                    simultaneously, we can no longer infer whether A is in C1 or C2 or both. In
                    fact, there is no way to know this other than by deriving it from a dataset of
                    geographical boundaries, or by recording it explicitly.</p></div>
                    <div><head>Place as an abstract concept</head>
                <p>Consider the placename <hi rend="italic">Dún na nGall/Donegal</hi> which can be
                    found in the north-west of Ireland. The question to ask is: how many places
                    called <hi rend="italic">Dún na nGall/Donegal</hi> are there in this corner of
                    Ireland? The answer will differ depending on one’s perspective. An outsider will
                    see only one, a county of that name. A local inhabitant will probably see two,
                    the county and its capital town of the same name. A local politician will
                    probably see an electoral division of that name and also a town of that name
                    with its town council. In total, there are five units called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dún na nGall/Donegal</hi> in that part of Ireland.</p>
                <p>In our database, these are treated as separate objects which, as far as the
                    database knows, only <hi rend="italic">happen</hi> to have the same name. That,
                    however, is unsatisfactory as it fails to distinguish a case like this from
                    cases such as the 19 places called <hi rend="italic">An Baile Mór</hi>
                    (literally ‘the large town’) which can be found all over Ireland and which
                    genuinely <hi rend="italic">happen </hi>to have the same name. Another reason
                    why this is unsatisfactory is that it introduces a potential for inconsistency
                    because data such as the Irish name’s grammatical information need to be
                    recorded five times instead of once.</p>
                <p>An ideal data structure would provide a way to connect several places to a single
                    ‘abstract place’. The abstract place would contain all information common to the
                    concrete places, such as names and historical citations, and these would then be
                    inherited by the concrete places.</p></div>
                    <div><head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Many of the issues illustrated here are inherently linguistic and stem from the
                    fact that we conceive of our database as primarily a lexical database and only
                    secondarily as a geographical database. A second cluster of issues is caused by
                    the heritage of conflicting and overlapping administrative hierarchies and from
                    the differences in perspective these hierarchies impose.</p></div>
