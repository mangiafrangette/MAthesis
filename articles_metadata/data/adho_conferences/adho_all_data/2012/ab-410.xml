                    analyses the tradition of wisdom literatures in ancient Greek, Arabic and other
                    languages, by presenting the texts digitally in a manner that enables linking
                    and comparisons within and between anthologies, their source texts, and the
                    texts that draw upon them. We are also creating a framework through which other
                    projects can link their own materials to these texts via the Semantic Web, thus
                    providing a ‘hub’ for future scholarship on these texts and in related areas.
                    The project is funded by HERA (Humanities in the European Research Area) as part
                    of a programme to investigate cultural dynamics in Europe, and is composed of
                    teams at the Department of Digital Humanities and the Centre for e-Research at
                    King’s College London, The Newman Institute Uppsala in Sweden, and the
                    University of Vienna.</p>

                <head>Historical background</head>
                <p>Throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages, anthologies of extracts from larger
                    texts containing wise or useful sayings were created and circulated widely, as a
                    practical response to the cost and inaccessibility of full texts in an age when
                    these existed only in manuscript form (Rodríguez Adrados 2009: 91-97 on Greek
                    models; Gutas 1981). SAWS focuses on <hi rend="italic">gnomologia </hi>(also
                    known as <hi rend="italic">florilegia</hi>), which are manuscripts that
                    collected moral or social advice, and philosophical ideas, although the methods
                    and tools developed are applicable to other manuscripts of an analogous form
                    (e.g. medieval scientific or medical texts; Richard 1962).</p>
                <p>The key characteristics of these manuscripts are that they are collections of
                    smaller extracts of earlier works, and that, when new collections were created,
                    they were rarely straightforward copies. Rather, sayings were reselected from
                    various other manuscripts, reorganised or reordered, and subtly (or not so
                    subtly) modified or reattributed. The genre also crossed linguistic barriers, in
                    particular being translated into Arabic, and again these were rarely a matter of
                    straightforward translations; they tend to be variations. In later centuries,
                    these collections were translated into western European languages, and their
                    significance is underlined by the fact that Caxton’s first imprint (the first
                    book ever published in England) was one such collection (Craxton [1477] 1877].
                    Thus the corpus of material can be regarded as a very complex directed network
                    or graph of manuscripts and individual sayings that are interrelated in a great
                    variety of ways, an analysis of which can reveal a great deal about the dynamics
                    of the cultures that created and used these texts.</p>

                <p>The SAWS project therefore has three main aspects:</p>
                <xmt:oList rend="arabic">
                    <item>The encoding and publication of a digital archive of editions of a
                        selected number of these texts; </item>
                    <item>The identification, publication and display of the links between<hi
                            rend="italic"> </hi>the anthologies, their source texts, and their
                        recipient texts; </item>
                    <item>The building of a framework for scholars outside the SAWS projects to link
                        their texts to ours and to other relevant resources in the Semantic Web.
                    </item>
                </xmt:oList>
                <div>
                    <head>
                        <hi rend="bold">TEI XML markup of editions</hi>
                    </head>
                    <p>Each of the texts is being marked up in TEI-conformant XML and validated to a
                        customised schema designed at King’s College London for the encoding of <hi
                            rend="italic">gnomologia</hi>. Our structural markup reflects as closely
                        as possible the way in which the scribe laid out the manuscript. The TEI
                        schema uses the <hi rend="bold">&lt;seg&gt; </hi>element to mark up base
                        units of intellectual interest (not necessarily identified as single units
                        by the scribe), such as a saying (statement) together with its surrounding
                        story (narrative). For example:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Alexander, asked whom he loved more, Philip or Aristotle,
                            said: ‘Both equally, for one gave me the gift of life, the other taught
                            me to live the virtuous life.’</hi><note>Gnomologium
                        Vaticanum</note></p>
                    <p>This contains both a statement and a narrative:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">&lt;seg type="contentItem"&gt;</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">   &lt;seg type="narrative"&gt;</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Alexander, asked whom he loved more, Philip or Aristotle,
                            said:</hi></p>
                    <p> <hi rend="bold">  &lt;/seg&gt;</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">   &lt;seg type="statement"&gt;</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Both equally, for one gave me the gift of life, the other
                            taught me to live the virtuous life.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">   &lt;/seg&gt;</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">&lt;/seg&gt;</hi></p>
                    <p>Each of these <hi rend="bold">&lt;seg&gt;</hi> elements can be given an <hi
                            rend="bold">@xml:id</hi> to provide a unique identifier (which can be
                        automatically generated) that differentiates them from all other examples of
                            <hi rend="bold">&lt;seg&gt;</hi>, for instance <hi rend="bold">&lt;seg
                            type="statement" xml:id="K.al-Haraka_ci_s1"&gt;</hi>. In other words, it
                        allows each intellectually interesting unit (as identified by our team’s
                        scholars) to be distinguished from each other unit, thus providing the means
                        of referring to a specific, often very brief, section of the text.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="bold">RDF linking within and between manuscripts</hi>
                    </head>
                    <p>Several types of relationships have been identified within and between the
                        manuscripts. These manuscript relationships exist at many different levels
                        of granularity, from links between individual sayings to interconnections in
                        families of manuscripts. These relationships are represented using an
                        ontology that extends the FRBR-oo model (Doerr &amp; LeBoeuf 2007) (the
                        harmonisation of the FRBR model of bibliographic records (Tillett 2004) and
                        the CIDOC (Doerr 2003) Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM)). The
                            SAWS<note>SAWS ontology:<ref target="http://purl.org/saws/ontology"
                                type="external">http://purl.org/saws/ontology</ref> ontology. Last
                            accessed 16th March 2012</note> ontology, developed through
                        collaboration between domain experts and technical observers, models the
                        classes and links in the SAWS manuscripts. Basing the SAWS ontology around
                        FRBR-oo provides most vocabulary for both the bibliographic (FRBR) and
                        cultural heritage (CIDOC) aspects being modelled.</p>
                    <p>Using this underlying ontology as a basis, links between (or within)
                        manuscripts can be added to the TEI documents using RDF markup.

                        one-way links (known as triples) from an object entity to a subject entity.
                        The use of RDF to represent relationships in markup has to date primarily
                        been seen in XHTML documents containing RDFa<note>RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and
                            Processing <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/"

                            accessed 31st October 2011.</note> (RDF in attributes); however it is
                        desirable to extend the scope of RDF in markup, so that RDF links can be
                        added directly into documents such as the TEI XML documents used in SAWS
                        (Jewell 2010). </p>
                    <p>To include RDF triples in TEI documents, three entities have to be
                        represented for each triple: the subject being linked from, the object being
                        linked to, and a description of the link between them. The subject and
                        object entities in the RDF triple are represented by the <hi rend="bold"
                            >@xml:id</hi> that has been given to each of the TEI sections of
                        interest. We use the TEI element <hi rend="bold">&lt;relation/&gt;
                        </hi>(recently added to TEI) to place RDF markup in the SAWS documents, with
                        four attributes as follows:</p>
                    <xmt:uList>
                        <item>The value of <hi rend="bold">@active</hi> is the <hi rend="bold"
                                >@xml:id</hi> of the subject being linked from; </item>
                        <item>The value of <hi rend="bold">@passive </hi>is the <hi rend="bold"
                                >@xml:id</hi> or<hi rend="bold"> URI </hi>(Uniform Resource
                            Identifier) of the object being linked to;</item>
                        <item>The value of <hi rend="bold">@ref</hi> is the description of the
                            relationship, which is drawn from the list of relationships in the
                            ontology;</item>
                        <item>The value of<hi rend="bold"> @resp </hi>is the name or identifier of a
                            particular individual or resource (such as a bibliographic reference). 
                            Many of the links being highlighted are subjectively identified and are
                            a matter of expert opinion, so it is important to record the identity of
                            the person(s) responsible. <p/><p/><p/><p/><p><hi rend="bold"

                                segment identified as ‘Proclus_ET_Prop.17_ci1’, and that this
                                relationship has been asserted by Elvira Wakelnig, 2012. </p><p>The

                                document if required: for our own purposes we have found it useful
                                to place it immediately after the closing tag of the <hi rend="bold"

                    <head>The SAWS ‘hub’ for enabling related projects to annotate and link their
                        own texts</head>
                    <p> The project is thus producing a framework for representing these
                        relationships, using an RDF-based semantic web approach, as well as tools
                        for creating these complex resources, and for visualising, analysing,
                        exploring and publishing them (Heath &amp; Bizer 2011). We are engaging with
                        scholars working on related projects in order to establish an agreed set of
                        predicates; the version currently being evaluated and deployed by scholars
                        is available as an ontology at<ref target="http://purl.org/saws/ontology"
                            type="external">http://purl.org/saws/ontology</ref> . The number of
                        manuscripts of this type is large, and the project is creating the kernel of
                        an envisaged much larger corpus of interrelated material. Many of the
                        subsequent contributions will be made by others; therefore we are creating a
                        framework of tools and methods that will enable researchers to add texts and
                        relationships of their own, which will be managed in distributed fashion. We
                        are also linking to existing Linked Data sources about the ancient world,
                        most notably the Pleiades gazetteer<note>Pleiades gazetteer:<ref

                            9th March 2012</note> which aims to document all the individuals
                        mentioned in textual Byzantine sources from the seventh to thirteenth
                        centuries. </p>
                    <p>Thus we will create an interactive environment that enables researchers not
                        only to search or browse this material in a variety of ways, but also to
                        process, analyse and build upon the material. This environment will provide
                        tools to browse, search and query the information in the manuscripts, as
                        well as making available SAWS-specific TEI schema and ontology files and
                        XSLTs used to extract semantic information from the structural markup and
                        metadata within the</p>
                    <p>TEI markup. We also hope to make available tools for adding and editing
                        manuscripts within the SAWS environment. The ultimate aim is to create a
                        network of information, comprising a collection of marked-up texts and
                        textual excerpts, which are linked together to allow researchers to
                        represent, identify and analyse the flow of knowledge and transmission of
                        ideas through time and across cultures.</p>
