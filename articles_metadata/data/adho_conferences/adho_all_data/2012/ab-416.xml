                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The HyperMachiavel project started with the idea of a tool that would aid
                    research communities comparing several editions of one text and in particular
                    comparing translations. </p>
                <p>The Italian studies department (Triangle laboratory) at ENS de Lyon has been
                    working for many years on fundamental texts, from Machiavelli, Guicciardini and
                    other contemporary followers, that put forward new political concepts throughout
                    Europe in the 16th century. The question addressed in the project was mainly
                    about the transfer of these concepts from one language to another, and
                    especially their reception in France. The first aligned corpora tested in our
                    tool gathers different editions of Machiavelli’s <hi rend="italic">Il
                        Principe</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">princeps edito</hi> from Blado in 1532
                    and the first four French translations of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.</p>
                <p>Inspired by machine translation and lexicographic domains, the system presented
                    in this paper proposes an annotation environment dedicated to the edition of
                    lexical correspondences and offers different views to assist humanities
                    researchers in their interpretations of the quality and the specificities of
                    translator’s work.</p>

                    <head> Synoptic View </head>
                    <p>To be able to identify lexical correspondences, machine translation tools
                        usually propose a frame of two panels, one for the source text and the other
                        for the target text. The visualized interface is meant for annotators to
                        easily revise the results obtained from automatic word alignment. In general
                        it only considers a pair of texts at a time.</p>
                    <p>In the world of digital editions, text comparison has always been of great
                        interest and the request to view diplomatic vs normalized transcriptions, or
                        simply different editions of one text increases all the more that digital
                        data become truly available. Systems such as the Versioning Machine
                        (Schreibman et al. 2007) already offers parallel views for TEI aligned
                        corpora with no constraint on the number of displayed texts. Being able to
                        take into consideration several target versions was an important starting
                        point when designing <hi rend="bold">HyperMachiavel</hi>. Therefore the main
                        panel offers a ‘Parallel view’ (see Fig. 1) to interact with processes that
                        need global context visualization (e.g. concordancer results).</p>

                    <p>To deal with text alignment, many tools working with pair of texts

                        Fleury et al. 2008) uses statistical measures of co-occurrence or combines
                        word distribution algorithm with cognates detection. Although original
                        investigation on automatic alignment has been proceeded for non modern texts
                        like in the Holinshed Project (Cummings &amp; Mittelbach 2010), our focus
                        was to fulfill the need for editing and controlling lexical correspondences.
                        Exploring these techniques will be done in a second development phase but
                        for the moment, HyperMachiavel imports aligned corpora encoded in XML-TMX or
                        XML-TEI and proposes a manual alignment feature for additional text files. </p>
                    <p>Because old edition texts usually present great variability in the lexical
                        forms, we favored a computer-aided system for bilingual search and put
                        efforts in the lexicography work environment. </p>

                <head> Lexicography and Lexical Tagging </head>
                    <p>Linguistic annotation tools make use of external dictionaries to tag texts
                        but cannot be applied on old texts per se. Combining this process with the
                        user’s analysis of the text to build its own lexical resource, either by
                        bringing corrections to the model or proposing partial tagging, is a
                        necessary condition for our study. Recent work conducted by Lay et al. 2010
                        have also emphasized the user’s interaction in the lexical exploration and
                        offers customization of lexical resources. HyperMachiavel follows that path
                        by presenting tokenizer’s choice (among which TreeTagger java implementation
                        by Helmud Schmid) and a general framework to consolidate endogenous or
                        external lexical resources that would work in harmony with the defined
                        corpora.</p>
                    <p>Information obtained from tokenization like category, lemma, word onset and
                        offset localisation in the texts are registered in XML files. A full-text
                        search engine, specially designed for the tool, uses this information, so
                        does the ‘Vocabulary view’ listing all the forms for each language in the
                        corpora. This view displays frequency information by text (see Fig. 2) and
                        brings a first impression on lexical distribution among versions, or authors
                        in our case.</p>
                    <p>The use of concordancer (Key Word In Context) that classically links
                        dictionary entries to corpora occurrences is central in the system (results
                        of monolingual search or after a selection from the ‘Vocabulary view’, e.g.
                        Fig. 3). As for equivalences detection are concerned, some authors have
                        shown that bilingual concordancers (ParaConc; Barlow et al. 2004; ConcQuest;
                        Kraif 2008) are very helpful. However viewing results of bilingual search
                        with concordancers in our case is not sufficient. As we want to compare
                        numerous source and target texts, a ‘Parallel Indexes view’ has been
                        designed and is described hereafter.</p>

                <div><head> Equivalences Detection and Validation </head>
                    
                    <p>Annotating equivalences is a long process and a semi-automatic scenario has
                        been introduced with the bilingual search. Results from that search are
                        displayed in the ‘Parallel indexes view’ (see Fig. 4). Some results will
                        show co-presence in an aligned segment of at least one source and target
                        searched items, but source or target occurrences could be found alone.</p>
                    <p>When the user is faced with empty results (source or target), the ‘Parallel
                        view’ helps detect other potential equivalence expression. In some cases, it
                        could mean that no translation has been given or that the occurrence belong
                        to another semantic group (e.g. homonyms, polysemes). </p>
                    <p>Validation of real equivalences versus suggested equivalences from the
                        bilingual search, is done by checking the lines. However manual completion
                        is often required, especially when source or target refer to specific
                        expressions or to other lexical terms that were not used in the search.</p></div>
                <div><head> Graph Visualizations </head>
                    <p>Exploring edited equivalences can be pursued in other environments like excel
                        or any data analysis programs but HyperMachiavel has developed some feature
                        to highlight thematic groups of equivalences and show stylistic differences
                        between translations.</p>
                    <p>For each dictionary entry, one can ask to see validated target equivalences.
                        Information about their frequency and distribution between versions of text
                        help the user evaluate translator’s appropriation of the source text (see
                        Fig. 5). Graph visualizations illustrate the same information but the user
                        can go further and ask to see equivalents of equivalents until no new
                        information is provided. Groups of equivalences usually appear and
                        interrogate the user on the conceptual themes exposed in the corpora. </p>
                    <p>In the current aligned corpora, we have noticed that most French translators
                        of <hi rend="italic">Il Principe</hi> depict the polysemic and complex
                        reality of new political concepts at that time by giving various lexical
                        equivalences. Yet one of the translators prefers to steadily deliver
                        concepts with almost unique translation (e.g. ‘stato’ with only ‘estat(s)’)
                        perhaps believing that the rest of the text would do the rest.</p></div></div>

                    distributed under a french open-source licence (Cecill-B). Although the
                    demonstration was done with only french-italian texts the tool was defined to
                    support manual edition of equivalences for aligned multilingual corpora and
                    lexicography work. </p>
                <p>Providing import and export formats recommended by the digital humanity community
                    ensure reuse of corpora in other environment such as text mining platform using
                    the full complexity of TEI encoded corpora (e.g. TXM<note>TXM is a collaborative, open-souce software initiated by S.Heiden and the textometrie project members (<ref target="http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/" type="external">http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/</ref>)</note> , Heiden 2010). Use of
                    automatic alignment algorithms will be tested with another aligned corpora based
                    on Machiavelli’s <hi rend="italic">The Art of War-</hi>translations. The idea is
                    to extend our tool features for comparable corpora (different texts of authors
                    highly influenced by Machiavelli’s work). </p></div>
