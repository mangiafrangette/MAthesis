            <p>The authors of this paper have been involved in preparing a series of enhanced
                    publications as part of a national initiative to introduce ‘enhanced publishing’
                    to scholars in the Netherlands. One of these publications is the scholarly
                    monograph <hi rend="italic">Virtual Knowledge,</hi> in production at MIT Press.
                    This paper reviews different approaches to enhanced publications. In particular,
                    it reports the intentions, challenges, achievements and tensions in the actual
                    workflows in preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Virtual Knowledge</hi>
                    enhanced publication version of the manuscript. An enhanced publication can
                    generally be described as scholarly text and related materials presented in a
                    Web environment with interlinking of document ‘objects’ (Jankowski et al. 2011).
                    These objects may include: research data, instrumentation, additional analyses,
                    post-publication addendums, and exchanges between book authors and readers.
                    These objects are often identified in a manner facilitating access and involving
                    utilization of uniform standards of identification. Basic enhancements to this
                    particular volume involve preparation of supplementary resources (e.g., links,
                    blogs, appendices), chapter visualizations (e.g., animations, figures, tables),
                    hyperlinks to materials in and external to the book, and opportunities for
                    conducting searches within and external to the book. The enhancements also
                    emphasize integration of informal scholarly communication (e.g., social media)
                    with traditional academic publishing. The enhanced component also emphasizes
                    integration of informal scholarly communication (e.g., social media) with
                    traditional academic publishing, and the efforts to achieve this aspect are
                    highlighted in the paper.</p>
                <p>The overall design strategy for this project was oriented toward introducing book
                    content on the web with two primary objectives in mind: 1) to facilitate
                    compatibility with contemporary Web-based discursive practices, and 2) to
                    facilitate content interoperability in both Web 2.0 and Semantic Web formats.
                    Challenges involved with the first objective are related to varied work
                    practices among participating authors. In addition to variation in skills,
                    competencies, and preferences in working with the web medium, the benefits from
                    the required additional work remain uncertain. The individual career benefit
                    from publishing a book is in most cases largely the same with or without the
                    Web-based enhancements. The second objective entails integration of two distinct
                    content structures. The resulting design is a hybrid platform that leverages Web
                    2.0 participatory modes of scholarly communication combined with formalized
                    content structures imposed by Semantic Web formats. Differences in the
                    affordances provided by these two content schemas brings into focus contemporary
                    tensions related to scholarly communication in the digital era and raises
                    interesting questions about the emerging role of digital media in scholarly
                    communication.</p>
            
            <p>The expected contribution of this approach to enhanced publications pertains to
                    consumption of the book content by both humans and machines. The platform
                    facilitates situating a published book among related scholarship, institutional
                    settings, and with regard to prior work from contributing authors. This is seen
                    as particularly useful for interdisciplinary research, and especially within a
                    still emerging field. This sort of contextualization is by itself envisioned as
                    value added from the standpoint of consumers of book content and for those
                    engaging in Web-based intertextual discourses. Another contribution is the ways
                    in which the book content is structured in the Web environment. Facilitated
                    through links, categories and tags, and the co-location of related materials,
                    contextualization of content also creates object relationships, e.g. between an
                    author and with regard to intertextual relationships, which are readable by
                    search engines. Fundamental to achieving these objectives is an understanding of
                    the Web as an environment that is dynamic and evolving, which is far removed
                    from not only the printed book, but also from the environment of digital
                    repositories.</p>
