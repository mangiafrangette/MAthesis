        <body>
            <p>This paper reports on our ongoing stylistiscs research and tool development in the
                    specific case of authorship attribution for the Middle Dutch Arthurian novel <hi
                        rend="italic">Roman van Walewein</hi> (Romance of Gawain). First we
                    introduce the use case, and we concisely recapture our prior research. We then
                    progress to the description of the re-issued improved software and algorithm we
                    developed and applied to our use case. We conclude with an overview of the first
                    results we derived from applying our tools and approach.</p><p>The <hi
                        rend="italic">Roman van Walewein</hi> (ca. 1260, Middle Dutch) was written
                    by two authors, Penninc and Vostaert. Only one manuscript containing the
                    complete text, explicitly dated as copied in the year 1350, is left to us. Some
                    fragments of another, probably somewhat younger manuscript contain about 400
                    lines. The text in the complete manuscript consists of 11,202 lines of rhyming
                    verse. The manuscript was written by two copyists. The first seems to have
                    written the lines 1-5.781 and the second the lines 5,782-11,202.</p><p>The second author, Vostaert, explicitly claims to have added about 3,300 lines to Penninc’s text.
                Several scholars of Middle Dutch have pointed out on various grounds that Vostaert
                (or the copied text) can not be correct in this claim. We decided to apply current
                state of the art authorship attribution techniques to find whether this would point
                us to a specific line in the text where the text before that line and the text after
                that line contrast the most. In prior research we have used a lexical richness
                measure, Udney Yule’s Characteristic K, and Burrows’s Delta to try to determine the
                position in the text where Vostaert may have started to complete Penninc’s text. We
                thus found that applying Burrow’s Delta indeed gives relatively strong grounds to
                assume that Vostaert simply stated a truth. Figure 1 can be read as a support of
                this finding, showing a significant change of stylistic stability occurring around
                verse line 7,882 (cf. van Dalen-Oskam &amp; van Zundert 2007). New knowledge that we
                derive from this result is that Vostaert may well have reworked the last portion of
                his predecessor’s work. However, the most surprising result was that our analysis
                pointed towards the possibility that Delta is a better indicator for a change of
                copyists than anything else (cf. the clear local maximum in the graph of figure 1,
                which is located around verse line 5,783 and reflects the change of hands that takes
                place in the manuscript).</p>

                        11,000 in Vostaert’s part of the romance was used as a subset for the
                        procedure. From this subset the top most 50 frequently used words were used
                        for comparison with the text in a ‘sliding window’ of each consecutive 1,000
                        lines. Taken from (van Dalen-Oskam &amp; van Zundert 2007)</head>

            <p>In our research until 2007 we were only able to tentatively look into this copyist
                distinguishing ability of the Delta measure, and it remains to be investigated until
                now how effective Delta is as a procedure for copyist distinction. Although
                Kestemont and van Dalen-Oskam (Kestemont &amp; van Dalen-Oskam 2009) verified the
                difference between the two scribes of the extent Walewein manuscript using a lazy
                machine learning technique on other features such as character n-grams and several
                simple rations, they did not apply a form of Delta procedure to this problem. In our
                2007 article we stated that the current application cannot easily and automatically
                generate and compare a large collection of Delta graphs based on an iterative
                subselection of a word frequency list’ (van Dalen-Oskam &amp; van Zundert 2007:
                360). This is the point where we resume our research endeavor. </p>
                <p>We have further developed our ‘sliding window’ approach to measuring the
                    stylistic consistency of texts (i.e. the ability to establish the stability of
                    the value of Delta throughout a single text). We will release the MIT licensed
                    open source Ruby code for this version of the software to Github in June 2012.
                    This version will include a REST-full interface to accommodate polling this tool
                    as a web enabled programmatically negotiable service, a web GUI for
                    human-computer based interaction with the tool, and user documentation as well
                    as format description specifics required for files to be parsed with this
                    tool.</p>
                <p>Our analyses until 2007 relied on stepping a ‘window’ through a text, computing
                    the Delta for that window of text using the complete text as a statistical
                    background and a sizeable portion of the part unanimously attributed to Vostaert
                    as a Delta comparison base. The graphs thus computed showed the consistency (or
                    non consistency) of Delta throughout the text tested. Having improved
                    scalability and performance of the algorithm we are now able to run several
                    Delta measuring windows through a text at higher speeds, enabling near instant
                    analysis (typically &lt;5s analysis time for a 65k tokens sized text, analyzed
                    through an approximately 8k token sized window). </p>
                <p>This improved approach has enabled us to return to the research question at hand:
                    how well does Delta discriminate copyists? With the current software we are able
                    to determine how stable the characteristic is for Delta that we found in our
                    first computations (see Fig. 1.) throughout the word frequency spectrum of the
                    text. Our algorithm computes the Delta characteristic of a text in an iterative
                    subselection of the word frequency list. For instance, it computes this
                    characteristic first in the top 50 highest frequency spectrum, then it does the
                    same for the top 10 to 60 highest frequencies, then for the top 20 to 70 highest
                    frequencies, then 30–80, 40–90, etc... The size and ‘pace’ of the frequency
                    subset window can in fact be chosen arbitrarily, though sensible heuristics need
                    to be applied to yield meaningful results. In essence then, the current
                    algorithm not only slides a window for Delta measurement through the text, but
                    also slides a measurement window through the frequency spectrum of the
                    vocabulary of the text. In the case of <hi rend="italic">Walewein</hi> this
                    yields typically a result as depicted in Fig. 2.</p>
            <p><figure>
                    <graphic url="img373-2.jpg" rend="left" height="256px" width="341px"

                    <head>Figure 2: Sliding the ‘walking’ Delta through a consecutive subset of
                        the full vocabulary frequency spectrum of the text of Walewein</head>
                </figure></p>
            
            <p>There are several conclusions we can draw from this result. The general
                characteristic we found in our earlier attempts to establish the stylistic
                consistency throughout the text of <hi rend="italic">Walewein</hi> holds for any
                subspectrum of high frequency vocabulary we choose. We conclude that the
                reproduceability of this characteristic in different frequency spectra, means that
                indeed this is a viable method of tracing stylistic consistency in a text. We also
                note that the value for Delta on average rises slightly when our window on the
                subset of high frequency word usage descends through the full spectrum of vocabulary
                frequencies. This in itself confirms that Delta is a valid indicator for stylistic
                similarity, or at least for similarity in high frequency word usage. But more
                important: because the peak of stylistic inconsistency around verse 5,782 is stable
                our findings also confirm our tentative assumption that ‘semi-high’ frequency word
                usage is a better indicator for copyist change than high frequency word use – at
                least in the specific case of the <hi rend="italic">Walewein</hi>. We can in the
                case of <hi rend="italic">Walewein</hi> also infer which part of the high frequency
                word use spectrum is the best indicator of copyist change: the 80 to 130 most
                frequently used words. Discussing the lexical characteristics of this part of the
                vocabulary as well as what this may indicate about copyist behavior will be part of
                our paper.</p>
            <p>Further testing on known use cases of copyist change need to establish whether this
                result is generalizable. If so, we may have found in this particular application of
                the Delta procedure an adequate identification procedure for copyist change.</p>
