        <body>
            <p>The Courtauld Gallery occupies a unique position in central London as a
                    university art museum and key facilitator for collaborative opportunities
                    between research academics and curatorial practitioners. Given the context of
                    the gallery as an institution housed within a building not purpose-built for the
                    function of exhibition, the ways in which the gallery space acts as a directive
                    on visitors’ viewing patterns is of particular interest. This paper introduces a
                    methodology of documenting and visualizing those patterns.</p>

                <p> The research is approached from the perspective of a performance specialist
                    (Guy), investigating the curated gallery as a place for performance and the
                    visitors’ role within such exhibition spaces. This has led to the generation of
                    questions vital to new methodological approaches for exploring data only
                    existent in the form of events, and to future processes of gallery operation and
                    evaluation.</p>

                <p> This paper focuses on the empirical aspects of this work, reporting on a project
                    to create digital objects, displayable in Virtual World platforms such as Google
                    Earth, from the experience of visitors to the Courtauld Gallery, London. The
                    digital objects consist of visualisations in virtual space and time of visitor
                    experiences, documented in KML, and represented using the Google Earth
                    platform.</p>
            <div>
                <head>Studying Visitor Experiences</head>

                <p>To date, the evaluation of exhibitions has largely been based on attendance
                    numbers, with very little attention given to actual visitor behaviours within
                    gallery environments. Traditionally, where visitor behaviours have been
                    observed, methods for achieving this have been based on pen and paper recording
                    using methods such as those developed by Space Syntax (Space Syntax, 2010).
                    Capturing this data in digital form will allow a more thorough and formal
                    analysis of the ‘success’ of exhibitions by permitting the replay in both time
                    and virtual space of visitors’ behaviours and their interaction with staff, other
                    visitors, and gallery exhibition materials. More specifically, we are concerned
                    with: <xmt:uList>
                        <item>patterns of movement within gallery spaces</item>
                        <item>specific pathways constructed by individual visitors through the
                            museum</item>
                        <item>duration of engagement with individual exhibits</item>
                        <item>actions and interactions of gallery visitors</item>
                    </xmt:uList></p>
                <p>This information makes possible an analysis of how visitors explore exhibitions
                    that is not preconceived but observed. Anonymous representations of visitor
                    behaviours can be offered back to the gallery prompting curatorial assumptions
                    to be validated or, where appropriate, reconsidered in light of evidential data
                    about real patterns of visitor behaviour. This, in turn, can have important
                    implications for maximizing public engagement within exhibition contexts and
                    ensuring efficiency of interaction between staff and visitors, as well as other
                    aspects of social and economic exchange. Using geovisualization techniques to
                    generate the interactive maps based on individual experience raises questions
                    about how possible it is to produce and manage the documentation of human
                    behaviour.</p>

                <head>Technological and Methodological Issues</head>

                <p>Ideally, visitors would be totally oblivious to the data capture process or at
                    least, such technological means as are necessary for capture would be
                    non-intrusive. The demands of the research problem require high fidelity of
                    location, orientation, and behaviour making the technological issues more
                    complex than simply determining approximate location. Borriello et al. (2005)
                    report that GPS systems do not work reliably inside buildings, wi-fi systems
                    require calibration and achieve accuracy of only about 3 metres, and others
                    require infrastructure installation. This is rarely possible in protected
                    buildings such as the Courtauld, especially on a temporary basis. Consequently,
                    the method described below was developed (related approaches will be discussed
                    in presentation). </p>
                <p>A pilot study was carried out prior to the main observation period in the
                    Courtauld’s Frank Auerbach exhibition (Courtauld Gallery, 2009).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Data Capture Method</head>


                <p>The method used is predominantly based on field observation in two forms. These
                    approaches are influenced by the observation methods used by Space Syntax, a
                    company with an established history of evidence-based design and evaluation for
                    buildings and urban spaces. Space Syntax observations are undertaken using pen
                    and paper.</p>

                <p> The first method involves a human observer tracking the movement pattern of
                    visitors around parts of the gallery in order to observe particularized routes
                    specific to individual visitors. This is facilitated by the use of Tablet PCs
                    and custom-developed software which displays an editable floor plan of the
                    gallery, divided into map tiles based on the gallery rooms. In the case of the
                    Courtauld, the map tiles are 610x365 pixels. The actual room size in the pilot
                    is approximately 1290.5cm x 772cm = 12.9x7.7m. By moving the digital pen around
                    the image the pathway of an individual can be recorded on the map and the
                    movement documented with an x,y pixel reference and a timestamp. Duration and
                    location are recorded both when the visitor is moving and stationary. Additional
                    coding concerning, for example, the activity undertaken at any given moment,
                    such looking at a map or signage or taking a photograph, can also be coded
                    against points on each pathway. </p>
                <p> The second method involves participants being asked to complete an exit
                    questionnaire detailing their familiarity with the specific gallery and exhibits
                    as well as more general experience of exhibition environments. This information
                    is cross-referenced to the trace of each visitor’s pathways.</p>

                <p>A screenshot from the software can be seen in Figure 1, showing a gallery
                    floorplan with a partial trace. Figure 2 shows the simple comma separated values
                    (CSV) data produced by the trace activity in realtime (the fields being <hi
                        rend="italic">X</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                        >timestamp</hi>, <hi rend="italic">visitor activity</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="italic">map file used</hi>). The system defaults to tracking movement
                    as the pen is drawn across the screen, however, the observer can simply switch
                    the “mode” of the current point by selecting one of the buttons to the right.
                    Where data about interaction with an exhibit is necessary, the point of the
                    observee’s interest can be noted by simply pointing at it on the diagram after
                    selecting either “Sign” or “Exhibit” as the object of interest. The final system
                    was developed in Borland Turbo Delphi with early prototyping undertaken in
                    Processing.</p>

                <p>For the Courtauld case study, the maps are scaled such that 1 pixel is
                    approximately 2cm2 of real gallery space. The maps are converted from
                    architectural plans and the location and size of furniture in the gallery
                    included from measurement in the galleries themselves. Visitor location is
                    recorded as a relative pixel position from the top left corner of the image.
                    After capture this data can be transformed to generate real visitor positions in
                    the room for subsequent visualisation.</p>

                    <head>Visualisation of Results</head>
                    <p>The relative positional information in the CSV file(s) is converted to
                        absolute positions and stored in KML. The timestamp stream that indicates
                        where a visitor was at a given time can be used to generate a trace of
                        movement (and speed).</p>

                    <p>For the purposes of the visualization, the floorspace of the Auerbach, as
                        defined by the map tiles in the data capture software, was rotated from its
                        SE-NW alignment (see Figure 3). This was necessary to facilitate the
                        georeferencing, or conversion of the x,y pixel data points into decimal
                        degree coordinates. It was therefore possible to make the observation that
                        the gallery room equated to 0.000118 x 0.000027 decimal degrees. The pixel
                        readings (<hi rend="italic">r</hi>)_ can therefore be converted to decimal
                        degrees (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) using the simple conversion formula d=W.
                        longitude – (0.000118/610)*r. For the latitude readings, this is repeated,
                        but substituting (0.000027/325). An arbitrary altitude value, starting at
                        0.001 at the first reading, and increasing sequentially by 0.001 throughout
                        the CSV dataset was added to the datapoints. In the visualization (see
                        Figure 4), this gives the impression of the pathway rising as the visitor
                        progresses through the gallery and through time: in this, it follows the
                        principle of the ‘space time cube’, developed elsewhere (Kraak, 2008). As
                        more data is added, this will allow us to build complex structured
                        visualizations, which will add significant support to interpreting the
                        visitors’ uses of, and interactions with, the space. These will be reported
                        in full in the full presentation of this paper.</p>

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>At the time of writing, the technology platforms are fully developed, ready
                        for use and have been tested (with subsequent enhancement) in a pilot
                        session in the gallery. The main observations will take place in November
                        and December 2009 during the Courtauld Gallery’s exhibition of <hi

                    <p>This paper has presented an approach to capturing visitor experience and
                        interactions in a gallery using methods based on tried and tested
                        approaches, but augmented by digital tools. The data generated can
                        subsequently be visualised in virtual space and time to allow questions of
                        performance practice to be addressed.</p>
