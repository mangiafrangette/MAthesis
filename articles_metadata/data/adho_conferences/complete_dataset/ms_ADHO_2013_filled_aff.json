       "abstract":"Since the middle of last the decade investments in large-scale e-infrastructures for the humanities have risen enormously. Projects such as CLARIN, DARIAH and more recently CLARIAH, received funding. But there is growing scepticism concerning the value of these big infrastructures. Some even argue that methodological innovation and the modelling of humanities data is better served by small-scale research. This paper will focus on the possibility of creating tailor made solutions for researchers or Virtual Research Environments (VREs), while at the same time connecting, using and contributing to the big infrastructures. A use case will be presented: ‘The speaking map of the Netherlands’. First of all this paper will give an overview of this project. Next it will go into detail concerning the access, sharing and storage of the data. Finally, the paper will reflect on future steps in connecting research data and tools to infrastructures.",

       "abstract":"   Technological advancement has made books available not only in printed format but also in electronic format. Bangladesh is currently experiencing the exponential growth of information and entertainment being created in a digital format. The government of Bangladesh declares ‘Digital Bangladesh’ by 2020. This steps, activities and environment are gaining importance particularly among younger people in Bangladesh (Islam & Tsuji 2011). This phenomenon may change the way people perceive about reading and how printed materials are being utilized to facilitate reading. At present this paper is the first attempt to measure reading habits and attitudes in digital environment of the students in Bangladesh. This study may trigger more such research in other developing countries.   Reading culture in Bangladesh  Based on the survey conducted Bishwa Sahitya Kendra meaning 'World Literature Center' the reading interest and habits of Bangladeshis is very low (Bishwa Sahitya Kendra, 2012). In Bangladesh, primary, secondary and higher secondary level education are completely in Bengali medium and in higher education is both in Bengali and English languages. As most of the web contents in Bangladesh are in English language, it usually reduces the reading habits in online environment. The electronic media is challenging the reading habit in the society by shifting the attention to computer, mobile phone and internet. In the last few years it has grown dramatically, although obviously from a very low base. With an estimated internet user-base of 7.5 million coming into 2012, representing a 5% user penetration by population, the local internet industry has been preparing to move into the next stage of its development (Internet World Statistics, 2012). In a recent survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), it was found that the literacy rate is only 56.8% (CIA, 2012).  Research about reading has been approached from various possible angles and from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds including literature, social science, library and information science, information systems and more recently information and communication technologies (ICT). With the growing amount of digital information available and the increasing amount of time that people spend reading electronic media, the digital environment has begun to affect people’s reading behavior. Studies on reading habits and attitude among university students has gained as much attention in recent years due to the impact of digital media made available through the internet (Liu 2005; Ramirez 2003). Several theorists in reading and literacy such as Landow (1992), Lanham (1993), O’Donnell (1998) and Murray (1997) all agree that the digital media brought through progressive development of ICT has introduced a transformative shift in reading and writing. University students have been known to be very receptive to different forms of media in their reading and writing practices. A number of scholars argue that the arrival of digital media, together with the fragmentary nature of hypertext, is threatening sustained reading (Healy 1990; Birkerts 1994). Birkerts (1994) further notes that the younger generation growing up in the digital environment lacks the ability to read deeply and to sustain a prolonged engagement in reading. Bolter (1991) states: “The shift from print to the computer does not mean the end of literacy itself, but the literacy of print, for electronic technology offers us a new kind of book and new ways to write and read”. Digital media contribute to a transformative shift in reading. They also introduce a number of powerful advantages that are traditionally absent in the printed environment, such as interactivity, non-linearity, immediacy of accessing information, and the convergence of text and images, audio and video (Landow 1992; Lanham 1993; Murray 1997; Ross 2003). Abidin, Pour-Mohammadi & Choon Lean (2011) conducted a study on Malaysian Chinese university students and it is revealed that the participants prefer the electronic media when reading for leisure but prefer the printed media to pass exams.   Methodology In this study, the researcher intends to explore the reading attitude and habits among the Dhaka University students using a survey research method.   Online survey tool An online survey tool Kwik Surveys was used for this research. The URL to the online questionnaire was sent mainly through different SNTs using personal messaging option and group post where the university students were connected via Facebook, Twitter, etc. Also, the URL was printed and provided to the students to respond to the questionnaire.   The questionnaire The survey requested basic demographic data regarding age, gender and academic status and also contained items regarding the reading attitudes and habits. Students were asked to provide answers of viz, how often do you read in a week, what types of materials do they read, resources to get the reading materials, reading materials in leisure time, times spend on reading in online and so on. The survey also included 7-point Likert scale items regarding students’ attitudes towards reading, preference of reading in online and manual (1 being the lowest and 7 being the highest). The data analysis was carried out using SPSS statistical analysis software.    Data analysis techniques In order to determine influence of students’ demographic characteristics on their opinions on reading attitudes and behaviour, Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis tests were carried out. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic characteristics of the students in relation to their reading books in digital environment. A total 192 students responded to the online survey.    Objectives of the study  This study attempts to answer the following Major Research Questions (MRQs) as formulated below: MRQ 1. What is the reading habit of the students in terms of the following?  (a) What type of reading material do they read? (b) How much time do student spend on reading? (c) Where do they get the reading material? (d) When do they read? (e) What do they read during leisure time? (f) What percentage of time reading spent on reading electronic documents, browsing and scanning, and their overall experience with online reading?  (g) What are the tools they use access to electronic resources?  MRQ2. What is the students’ attitude towards reading?  (a) Do they love to read book? (b) Do they think reading is boring? (c) Do they feel pleasure to spend money for buying book?  (d) Which medium (printed or online) do they feel comfort for reading book? (d) What is their overall reading attitudes and other relevant issues?   MRQ3. Is there any relationship between gender, age, study level with their reading habit and attitude?   Findings  This study was conducted in an attempt to enhance our understanding about reading habits and attitudes of the university students in Bangladesh focusing on a case of a public university. In this effort, students from all the faculties were chosen as the respondents. In overall analysis that include both groups, results indicates that university students spend quite a signiﬁcant amount of time reading newspapers 84.90% and second highest is the academic books 61.46%. A good number of students (50%) read also website materials. Reading has also become a major activity during their leisure time. Most of the students (57.81%) read fiction and novel in their leisure time and it is followed by newspaper 55.73%, magazine 43.75% and website materials (29.17%). The amount of time spent on reading other materials by the university students is seen as higher than their academic books and materials. This group is expected to read more due to their engagement in the academic process that requires them to read. Despite different extent in the preference among different genders and different study level, the study ﬁnds that preference for reading printed text remains strong which is 51.56%. This clearly indicates that printed media is the more used than online media due to the lack of facilities, poor online content and less availability of reading materials in online. On the other hand, students prefer reading in online environment when read short documents, casual reading and most recent information which mean score is above 4. In online environment, access to electronic resources mobile phone, laptop and desktop are the most used tools. Attitudes towards reading was high as the statements love to read books, like to read books when have free time and enjoyment from reading score was above 4. Several limitations can be found in the conduct of this study. Among them are the small sample size, the inclusion of only one university and the limited amount of variables studied. A bigger scale study need to be conducted for more reliable results, and with the inclusion of more variables such as family background, reading exposure and availability of reading materias, and variables that are related speciﬁcally with reading in the digital environment. In addition, the ﬁndings of the study should assist the university authority, especially the library and the computing department to look into service matters pertaining to accommodating the reading as well as the studying habits of the student. 24 hours of computing service may also allow students to use the internet since the day time is fully occupied with classes. This practice has been carried out in many western high academic institutions.   ",

       "abstract":"Of the qualities claimed to be normal for work in the digital humanities, $2 is perhaps the least well understood. Discussion of this quality is either dominated by the ontological question, “what is interdisciplinarity?”, or considered solely in terms of collaboration among researchers from different disciplines. Neither helps the individual researcher (whether working alone or as part of a team) understand how to think his or her way into the disciplines of others and understand what they have to offer from their own perspective. In the proposed paper I will discuss the problem and illustrate a way forward by describing a doctoral-level course in interdisciplinary research that I have taught for the last three years.",

       "abstract":"   Collation comes from the Latin confero (perfect participle collatum) meaning  ‘bring together’. There are several meanings in English, among them ‘bring together for comparison … in order to ascertain points of agreement and difference’ (OED, 2012). Even here collation may refer to a mechanical, manual or computerised process of comparing texts. My focus is on the latter, because it derives from an originally manual process as described, for example, by West (1973, 66f) and Dearing (1962, 14ff). Collation was a key part of the preparation of a critical edition because it supplied the raw differences between a chosen copy text and the other versions that aided the establishment of a single text suitable for printing.  Vinton Dearing in 1962 described what is perhaps the world’s first collation program (1962, 18-19). It compared two texts, one line at a time, within a window of 10 lines in either direction. Once a line (or later a word) was matched in the two versions being compared, the window was moved on. This allowed it to recognise insertions, deletions, substitutions and transpositions over short distances. The window was used probably because memory on the IBM 7090 for which it was written, was limited. This basic design was then followed in all subsequent collation programs. For example the collation program of Froger (1968 234), ‘EDIT’  (Silva and Bellamy 1969, 41-25),  ‘OCCULT’ (Petty and Gibson 1970), the collation program of Gilbert (1973), ‘UNITE’ (Marín 1991), ‘PC-CASE’ (Shillingsburg 1996, 144-148), ‘TUSTEP-Collate’ (1979), ‘URICA!’ (Cannon and Oakman 1989), ‘DV-Coll’ (Stringer and Vilberg 1987) and ‘Collate’ (Robinson 1989, 1994) all appear to use the same ‘sliding window’ technique. The size of the window varies, and in various programs extra features are added such as the ability to embed references, define transposed blocks and perform spelling normalisation (Collate), or the ability to merge collation output from each run (TUSTEP, PC-CASE).   One point often mentioned in these early collation programs is that they were developed to automate the manual process of producing a print edition. As Cannon explains: ‘automatic collation should proceed as it would be performed manually’ (1976, 33). Robinson also admits, when talking of the automatic treatment of variants that ‘most electronic editions do the same as book editions: they just do more of it, perhaps with marginally more convenience’ (2003). The sliding window technique has come to define what automatic collation is, but it has some serious technical limitations. For example, it cannot see alignments of words outside of the window, and this makes it prone to mistakes, which must be manually corrected. However, modern computers have no need of a window, as they can easily load into memory the entire text for comparison. One may also ask whether a print-based collation technique is really suited to a modern fluid medium like the Web. Differences discovered by a machine are not always suitable for display on a screen. As Robinson points out: ‘Some differences will be just, well, noise: only a few ... are real variants, of real interest to real scholars.’ (2009, 349). Hence all the early collation programs employ filtering, whether some kind of fuzzy matching, or a normalisation table to discount minor spelling variants. However, an apparatus generated in this way cannot subsequently be recombined with the base text to produce the faithful text of another version, because after filtering it contains only a tiny fraction of the true differences. It thus can only be attached to a base version as a series of notes, which limits the possibilities for display and interaction between user and text.  Another problem arises from the use of embedded markup. When SGML and then XML became popular from around 1990, there was a notable decrease of interest in collation programs. Existing programs were not updated, and replacements that fully handle XML have not yet emerged. The reason seems to be that if the computed differences between two texts contain disconnected start or end-tags, how does one supply the missing tags? In the case of an apparatus entry generated from TEI-XML such as: ‘word</hi>’, what is the format of ‘word’? It could be anything because the start-tag and its attributes have been lost. So markup must be stripped out before collation can take place, as is done, for example, in Juxta Commons (2012). But stripping out markup is prone to error: how, for example, does one deal with embedded notes, and interpretations, or alternatives like ‘sic’ and ‘corr’ or embedded variants? (Schmidt 2012a). It also makes it difficult to compare formatting differences, and to later restore the markup, because the differences only refer to the stripped text. A further problem is whether people really want to see a print apparatus on the screen. Although it may be defended as a traditional form of variant display, what the modern user ultimately wants is interactivity. The essence of the modern Web is animation or the ability to edit and contribute in real time, not statically formatted data.    From collation to merging What is needed for the medium of the Web is a thorough reassessment of the collation process. As a first step the difficulties in comparing embedded markup can be avoided by separating the text from its properties. ‘Standoff properties’ (Schmidt 2012a), which are modelled on LMNL (Piez, 2010), can be used in place of embedded XML, and may be generated from plain text or XML files. For each version this produces one version of the text and one or more markup files. The text and markup can then be merged separately, using the nmerge program (Schmidt 2009), into multi-version documents, which record the differences between all the versions globally – not merely between the base version and the rest. Because it doesn’t use a sliding window, but looks for differences over the entire text, nmerge doesn’t lose its way. The separately computed differences in the markup and the text are merged with the text’s own structural properties and then formatted into HTML, without the need for XML. This new platform for digital editions facilitates various techniques for displaying variation (Figure 1). Each display is generated as a partial web-page so it can be incorporated into any kind of Web-delivery system: Figure 1: Collation workflow using MVD+standoff properties The most popular of these is the side-by-side display. Examples include MEDITE (Bourdaillet and Ganascia 2006), the MVD-GUI (Schmidt et al. 2008), Juxta Commons (2012), the Trein der Traagheid electronic edition (Roelens et al. 2012), the Versioning Machine (Schriebman 2011), etc. Some of these programs have synchronised scrolling, which helps keep compared versions in alignment. Side by side view is more suited to programs like MEDITE or nmerge that compute character-level differences as opposed to word-level differences, because the user can see at a glance how two similar words differ. And multi-version documents already contain all the differences between versions, which don’t need to be recomputed each time, resulting in a much faster response, as can be seen in the AustESE (Australian electronic scholarly editions) test web interface (Schmidt 2012b).  Another popular type of variant display is the table, as found in CollateX (Dekker et al. 2011), and in the Cervantes hypertext edition (Urbina 2008). This is particularly useful in textual criticism because it presents much the same information as the old apparatus, but in a native digital form. In the AustESE test interface, table view (Figure 2) offers several options to reduce variant clutter without resorting to filtering. Character-level granularity can be easily extended to word-level, which is more useful for this type of display. Table view has the advantage over side-by-side in that it allows the user to explore the differences between a larger set of versions. Combining a horizontally scrolling table of variants with a synchronised vertically scrolling main text even produces a credible replacement for the print critical edition in digital form (Schmidt 2012b).  Figure 2: Table view   Conclusion The goal of collation on the Web is to provide the user with a variety of display options for exploring variation in a work. Collation conceived as a process for producing an apparatus or a filtered set of differences external to the text is too limited a technique to satisfy the flexible delivery options of the Web. Merging variant versions into a single digital object, on the other hand, provides a more efficient and direct way to query differences between versions, and to present the results through various views. Embedding markup into the text also creates problems for collation, and its removal allows differences between versions of text and markup to be merged as separate layers into the final result. The medium of the Web thus offers more than just new ways to display old data. It challenges us to rethink fundamentally the way we create the modern edition.   ",

       "abstract":"  Given that the nature of the research work involves computers and a variety of skills and expertise, Digital Humanities (DH) researchers are working in teams with Humanists, Computer Scientists, other academics, undergraduate and graduate students, computer programmers and developers, librarians and others within their institutions and beyond (Williford et al., 2012).  These projects’ scope and scale also requires larger budgets than is typically associated with Humanities research (Siemens, 2009, Siemens et al., 2011a).  As a result, Digital Humanists must developed meta-methodological skills, including teamwork and project management, to support the important and necessary methodological and technological ones in order to achieve project success.  Programs such as the University of Victoria’s Digital Humanities Summer Institute’s Large Project Management Workshop (www.dhsi.org), MITH’s Digital Humanities Winter Institute (MITH 2012), University of Virginia’s Praxis Program (Scholars' Lab, 2011) and internships with libraries and DH centres (Conway et al. 2010) are contributing to the formal skill development in these meta-methodological areas while DH teams themselves are reflecting on the importance and nature of collaboration skills developed directly through experience (Liu, et al. 2007; Ruecker, et al. 2007; Ruecker, et al. 2008; Siemens, et al. 2010). While McCarty (2005) articulates a “intellectual and disciplinary map” for DH (118), which has become an important and agreed upon description of the discipline, no corresponding framework of these necessary meta-methodological skills exists that can guide the preparation of Digital Humanists to be as “comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets” (Scholars' Lab 2011), either within a traditional academic post or an alternative academic one (The Praxis Program at the Scholars' Lab 2012).  By drawing upon exemplary DH projects which exhibit individual components of this framework, this paper contributes to larger discussions by suggesting those important meta-methodological skills, knowledge and tasks, whose absences may impact a digital project’s success and long-term sustainability.  It ties together the many discussions about undergraduate and graduate DH training and education happening simultaneously across many various forums.  As can be seen in Figure 1, these meta-methodological skills involve more than collaboration and project management skills and include those typically associated with academic entrepreneurship.  In their recent report on DH project sustainability, Maron and Loy (2011b) characterize digital resource projects as “small start-up businesses” (32) and use entrepreneurial language, such as empowered leadership, creation of a strong value proposition, cost management, revenue strategies and others to describe the ways in which case study DH projects have managed the impact of the current economic crisis on them.  Further, their definition of sustainability, “the ability to generate or gain access to the resources — financial or otherwise — needed to protect and increase the value of the content or service for those who use it” draws further attention to skills, such as management, leadership, budget management, creation of alternative revenue streams, knowledge about users and their needs, and others (Maron, et al. 2011b, 10; Shane 2004).  This view has been reinforced in a recent report that reviewed the Digging into Data program.  Using the table metaphor, the authors likened project management expertise as the fourth leg, along side data management, domain, and analytical expertise (Williford, et al. 2012).  Many digital projects are incorporating aspects of these skills, knowledge and tasks already.  For example, several projects are taking active steps to identify and understand users and their needs and then to ensure that the digital resources address these and allow the user to do more or do it faster or differently than before, while ensuring that knowledge of these resources reach the users (Warwick, et al. 2006; Siemens, et al. 2011b; Ithaka S&R, 2009; Shane 2004; Cohen, et al. 2005).  To this end, the LARIAH report (2006) recommends that digital projects consult users widely, often, in a variety of forms and at the different development stages to ensure that a digital resource is in fact used consistently show “a deep understanding and respect for the value their resource contributes to those who use it” (Maron et al., 2009, pg. 7).  One way to approach this is have users directly involved in the resource’s development as is the case with TEI-C (nd-b) and Zotero (nd).  In other cases, a digital resource can identified new users and extended its services to them, as can be seen with NINES’ move beyond the 19th century to develop a supporting resource for the 18th (18thConnect; Bromley 2011).  Alternatively, the digital resource may broaden offerings with new value added services, such as community websites, discussion lists, book and journal distributions and others, in response to users’ requests (Iter 2011).  Social media, such as twitter, youtube, and Wikipedia, can also be used to both gather information about users and promote the resource itself.  For example, The Modernist Versions project combined an #yearofulysses, webpage, digital version release of Ulysses, and Ulysses Art Competition as a way to generate knowledge (and perhaps even excitement) about the initiative (The Modernist Versions Project).  Alternatively, the TEI-C used a viral marketing experiment to understand the size and geographical distribution of its community of practice as it increased awareness of the guidelines (Siemens, et al. 2011b).  Digital resource logos embedded in other projects can be important for generating awareness of a resource and its potential uses (TEI-C, nd-a; Zotero).  At a basic level, projects must be pro-active in planning effective ways to promote themselves (Guiliano 2012). As various granting agencies are increasingly prioritizing funding for project development rather than the maintenance and ongoing operations and resource improvements (National Endowment for the Humanities, 2010, Maron et al., 2009), digital projects must develop alternative revenue and funding models that allow them to move from grant funding to “a longer term plan for ongoing growth and development” and to even survive changes in the funding environment (Maron, et al. 2011a, 4; 2011b).  These models might include cooperative advertising and click-through ads (Internet Shakespeare Editions, 2010), subscriptions (Iter 2011) and smart phone apps (iHistory Tours 2010b).  In order to ensure appropriate levels of resources can be gathered, digital projects must also understand methods to budget the costs need to “cover the costs of the tasks essential to the development, support, maintenance and growth of their projects” (Maron, et al. 2009, 15; Guthrie, et al. 2008; Scholars' Lab, 2011).  The latter becomes particularly important since there are expectations that digital resources will continue and be updated and improved with changes in scholarship and technology (Kretzschmar Jr. 2009; Ithaka S&R 2009).  Digital projects can then combine both revenue and cost management into long term sustainability plans, often required by funders (National Endowment for the Humanities 2010).   While financial resources are important, long term sustainability and development of digital projects also relies heavily on leadership (Maron, et al. 2011a; Maron, et al. 2009; Shane 2004; Siemens, 2009).  These leaders have “a certain passion and tireless attention to setting and achieving goals” (Maron, et al. 2009, 7).  This leadership is multifaceted and includes the supervision of human resources, such as paid staff, volunteers and collaborators, and cost and revenue management as well as strategic planning (Ithaka S&R 2009; Shane 2004; National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities 2010).  As an example, Transcribe Bentham publishes regular project updates as motivators to its volunteer transcribers (Transcribe Bentham 2011).  In addition, these project leaders need to continue to educate colleagues, administration and granting agencies so that these individuals understand the value of DH and the level of support needed for continued growth and development, including financial, in-kind and human resources, recognition and others (Ithaka S&R 2009; Siemens, 2010).   The project leader for the 40-year old Thesaurus Linguae Graecae considers “it her job to ‘educate’ current and incoming administrators about her project” (Ithaka S&R 2009, 2).  Finally, a strong leader understands when outside expertise and partnerships are necessary to ensure project success (Maron, et al. 2009).  The Niagara 1812 iphone app development team included not only writers, researchers, and software developers, but also the nGen-Niagara Interactive media Generator and Brock Business Consulting Group, providing expertise that is not typically available in a History department (iHistory Tours, 2010a). Figure 1: Meta-methodological Commons1 Given the nature of digital projects, academics, particularly those from the Humanities, need to adopt these important meta-methodological skills and knowledge in addition to content and methodological ones to ensure project success (Ithaka S&R 2009; Cohen, et al. 2009; Cohen, et al. 2005).  By outlining the range of meta-methodological skills, this framework has the potential to strengthen the positive work already ongoing to develop these skills and knowledge and to contribute to the discussion about the important skills that Digital Humanists need to create successful, useful and used projects (LeBlanc 2011; Leon 2011; McCarty 2011; Rovira 2011; Spiro 2011; Cohen, et al. 2005; Scholars' Lab 2011).  This paper also contributes to the larger discussion of regarding undergraduate and graduate training and education in Humanities, DH, and beyond and provides a context for thinking about the additional skills needed for both faculty and alternative academic positions (Thaller, et al. 2012; Scholarly Communication Institute 2012; The Praxis Program at the Scholars' Lab 2012; Sample 2012; Pannapacker 2012; Williford, et al. 2012).  Finally, it is designed to enable those who work in such teams or who work to support these individuals to recognise and develop the necessary meta-methodological skills and knowledge that lead to project success.

       "abstract":"The modern digital edition is a collection of text and facsimile images of sources. But what we lack currently are better ways to integrate these forms of digital surrogate. Image-based electronic editions were proposed some years ago as a way to link sections of images to sections of corresponding text. The AustESE (Australian electronic scholarly editing) project aims - among other things - to develop interoperable tools for viewing, editing and storing such links in a reusable and shareable way. The TILT tool is a Java applet that can create text-image links and automate the process on several levels: by auto-recognising lines and words on print and manuscript pages even when they are tilted or wavy, and by auto-selecting the corresponding text simultaneously. This would enable the rapid creation of text-image link data and make image-based electronic editions more practical.",

The ensemble of narratives explores how personal experiences of migration overlap and/or vary, and how migration impacts teaching and learning on trans/national scales. Putting first-hand accounts into dialogue with research on academic migration and migration more generally, the project’s designer asks: How does the collection of digital narratives from the Nazarbayev University campus community contribute to current research on migration? What do the narratives reveal about the formation of individual and national identities in an era of increased migration and information technology? And, how does the project’s digital storytelling platform promote transnational discussion, thereby impacting trends in higher education?",

       "abstract":"Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) is one of the most influential female authors of the Middle Ages. From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to her is fascinating, because of the complex authorship underlying it. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language which she did not completely master. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. The extent to which these 'copyeditors' have interfered with Hildegard’s style has been the subject of intense debate. In this paper we will quantitatively assess whether Hildegard's oeuvre is still a stylistically coherent corpus, distinguishable from that of contemporary authors, in particular her last secretary, Guibert of Gembloux. This paper carries wider relevance for stylometry: stylometrists typically focus on high-frequency function words, carrying only grammatical meanings. In the case of Hildegard, it were exactly these grammatical words that were often corrected by her scribes.",

To address these questions, we have collated relevant evidence in a detailed catalogue of one-hundred digital editions, which will be further developed into a large, scholarly online resource for the Digital Humanities and Digital Classicist communities. The catalogue records project features, scope, philological as well as technological aspects and, once all the data we have collected has been analysed, it will help establish the state of the art and draw a 'digital edition best practice' profile. Furthermore, the creators of each project have been contacted to access back-end information, such as project goals, budgets, achievements, user enquiries and user statistics, all of which will help to clearly define both the production needs and end-user requirements for digital editions.",

       "abstract":"  In order to use geographic information systems (GIS) to understand any aspect of human systems, researchers and teachers require a GIS capable of dealing with temporal information. Recognition of this need among historians, the humanities disciplines, and the historical social scientists extends back at least as far as the initial development of TimeMap (not maintained after 2007) in conjunction with the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) in the late 1990s. The project presented in this abstract represents a portion of a larger effort to improve spatio-temporal GIS by developing a database management system, Intentionally-Linked Entities (ILE), consisting of a data structure of direct linking via pointers, rather than storing data in tables, as in a relational database management system (RDBMS). We have taken advantage of linking information entities/objects directly to other entities/objects to create a better exploratory GIS viewer for those seeking to evaluate a large historical database. When fully implemented the fully-linked data model such as ILE offers many advantages for spatio-temporal GIS. The model permits relationships with unlimited arity (number of roles) that are represented by direct links.  Currently the RDBMS permits unlimited arity but relationships are not represented by direct links, whereas network/graph databases (such as the increasingly popular Neo4J (Anonymous, 2013) represent relationships with direct links but are limited in arity to 2.  Additionally, network/graph databases have no means of representing entity sets, making them unsuitable for ontological inferences.  High arity, direct representation of arity sets, and direct linking are all important attributes for representing and analyzing complex systems often found in the Humanities. However, for purposes of designing a better temporal GIS exploratory viewer, the major technical innovation relates to quick, effortless searches through large amounts of data. The current standard GIS represent temporal data by means of time-stamping within an RDBMS, leading to much redundant data (Yuan and Hornsby, 2008).  The RDBMS is inefficient for temporal applications because all queries require a database search, which is inefficient even with indices because temporal applications require frequent searches as the user moves from one time period to another. We have employed a direct-linking data structure with pointers so that NO searches are required during the display of data. No special work-around in data modeling or indexing is necessary to enhance data exploration. We used CHGIS (China Historical GIS) V. 4 (current version) time-series database as our test bed. This database is a good test bed because of the amount of data involved, especially when all seven input files are used at once. Moreover, CHGIS is the most accessible and logically designed of all current historical GIS (HGIS) databases available. Bol (Bol, 2007), director of Harvard’s Center for Geographic Analysis and CHGIS founder, wrote that the CHGIS database can be used as an authoritative historical database. Therefore it should be of great interest to be able to find and hopefully correct the errors or note the irregularities. CHGIS’ metadata indicates that the database is established on the datum North American Datum of 1927 (NAD-27), and we have used the Xian 1980, Transverse Mercator projection, which is the correct projection, for examining the relative positions of the provincial capitals and their boundaries. We explored some of the available options for viewing temporal GIS data by starting with Google Earth. Berman (Berman, 1999), who engineered the pioneering data model and software for CHGIS, wrote, “Now we can browse through hundreds, or thousands of years of Historical GIS objects .... Interestingly, the temporal browsing functionality is only possible using a free software application, Google Earth ..., but cannot be done with any of the major commercial GIS packages.” We found Google Earth to be awkward and confusing. When used with the two time-series provincial data files of CHGIS, the display was often too messy to comprehend precisely. The labeling is very poor, with the names of the capitals showing only in Chinese characters unless we place the mouse over the placemark. Surprisingly, even though the time resolution of the CHGIS time series database is one year, Google Earth only seems to be able to display data sometimes every seven years (such as 373, 380, 387,...) and sometimes every eight years (there is a gap between 1490 and 1498). There are temporal points in the database itself that lie on years that Google Earth apparently cannot display. We attempted to set software preferences and to look in the database files, in vain, to see if there are instructions telling Google Earth to skip or not to skip years. We can only guess that the Google Earth designers skipped years in order to reduce the data handling load. Finally, when asked to animate the map by running through the years, Google Earth animates the map at a speed that is far too rapid for the eyes to comprehend, even at the slowest speed setting [1]. This is not too surprising since Google Earth was probably not created specifically for Historical GIS, and also because of the year skipping mentioned earlier. We also tested ESRI ArcGIS Explorer on the time-series CHGIS data. Explorer behaves very strangely, however.  When sliding the time slider to the right, the time did not always progress in the forward direction! For instance, starting from year 778, the progression in years for the ArcGIS Explorer was 778 - 780 - 786 - 784 - 786 (That's right, another 786!) - 864 - 804 - followed by a crash, which is something that occurs often, even on a powerful PC. After these unsatisfactory experiences, the first author wrote his own HGIS viewer, Clearview, which displays the provincial boundaries and capital locations clearly. Clearview is also capable of displaying the data at every temporal point for which there is data. Additionally, Clearview’s automated display has a widely adjustable speed that allows slow enough settings for viewing comfortably by a user.  Clearview also mines the html data in the place marks to display Pinyin names, and it can be modified to display whatever the user wants. Due to the clarity of Clearview’s display, the user can clearly visualize the relative locations of provincial capitals relative to their boundaries. As soon as the user animates Clearview through time, it is immediately obvious that there are many instances of provincial capitals that are outside the respective provincial boundaries.  Subsequently the first author wrote another piece of software, which goes through the entire CHGIS time-series provincial dataset and computes how many instances there are where a provincial capital lies outside the same province's boundary. This software found the following: 124 instances of the provincial capitals lying outside the same province's boundary, an irregularity (perhaps an error since normally a capital lies inside (or on) the boundary) compared to 420 instances in which the provincial capitals lies inside the same province's boundary. (An instance is a province together with a maximal period during which there are no changes in that province.) There are also three instances in which the provincial capital exists but there is no polygon for the corresponding province, which is not an error. There are also seven curious irregular instances where a province has two capitals the same year. In each case these two locations appear to be so widely separated, sometimes in different polygons. These may not errors since some are military governorships not provinces, but this fact should be in the database. Getting Clearview to work on large amounts of data requires technical innovation. One way to achieve direct linkage from each time step in the database to all the objects to be displayed at that time step was covered in Kantabutra, et al. (2010). However, with the large amount of data in CHGIS, the number of links can be very large. Suppose a geographical object is valid for 1000 years, then the pointer scheme in Kantabutra, et al. requires 1000 links from the time objects corresponding to those 1000 years to the graphical object.  For this viewer, we ameliorate the situation by using a data structure call the Tree of Time. This structure is similar to the Time Tree used for multiresolution video (Finkelstein, et al., 1996), but used differently. The Tree of Time is a binary tree structure (Cormen, et al, 2007). The Tree of Time is indeed a search tree, but the only searching that occurs is done during the tree construction. When Clearview is running, no searching takes place because each time-object already has pointers to the tree nodes, whose time intervals contain the time represented by the time-object. Because CHGIS intervals are one year, that is the setting for this demonstration, but the Tree of Time can be used for any time resolution in a data set. The Tree of Time is used internally and the user doesn’t have to deal with its complexity. The software for discovering data errors or irregularities also employs complex data structures in order to ensure correct and efficient enumeration of such situations.

The technique technique presented in this proposal is based on Delta and extended with the general concept of bootstrap. The method relies on the author’s empirical observation that the distance between samples similar to each other is quite stable despite different features tested, while the distance between heterogeneous samples usually displays some unsteadiness. The core of the procedure is to perform a series of attribution tests in 1,000 iterations, where the number of features to be analyzed is chosen randomly; in each iteration, the nearest neighbor classification is performed. The presented procedure displays an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art methods used in stylometry, but it is far more sensitive to fake candidates.",

       "abstract":"   1 Introduction For more than forty years now, modern theories of literature insist on the role of paraphrases, rewritings, citations, reciprocal borrowings and mutual contributions of any kinds. The notion of intertextuality was introduced in the sixties to approach these phenomena. PHOEBUS is collaborative project that makes computer scientists from the University Pierre and Marie Curie (LIP6-UPMC) collaborate with the literary teams of Paris-Sorbonne University with the aim to develop efficient tools for literary studies that take advantage of modern computer science techniques.  In this context, we have developed a piece of software that automatically detects and explores networks of textual reuses in classical literature. Written in PROLOG this program has been extensively tested on Isidore Ducasse texts (Lautréamont, 2009) that are known to contain many reuses and on “La comédie humaine” (Balzac, 1976-1981) from Honoré de Balzac, which, according to (Duclos, 2012), reuses some texts of his friend Théophile Gautier (Gautier, 2002). We claim that our approach is more efficient than comparable ones, e.g. (Roe, 2012) (Büchler, Crane, Mueller, Burns, & Heyer, 2011). This abstract describes the principles on which is based this program, the significant results that have already been obtained and the perspectives for the near future.   2 Distinctions between Plagiarism, Pastiches, Citations and Textual Reuses Before going into the detail of the description of the techniques that are used, let us note that the notions of literary textual reuse and citation, which we aim to automatically detect, have to be distinguished from two similar notions: the plagiarism and the pastiche. The plagiarism consists in robbing the work of another, i.e. in fraudulently appropriating his/her texts, without mentioning explicitly their origin. As such, the plagiarism is considered as an unethical practice that has to be tracked and prosecuted. Many techniques have been developed to detect plagiarism that is considered as some plague, because intellectual work is stolen. By contrast, the pastiche is an artistic practice that imitates an artist, a style or a period. There is nothing wrong with it, except that it mocks well-known authors. Many great writers, for instance Marcel Proust, began by pastiches for the fun and to improve their style. Their detection is close to the identification of literary style (Dinu, Niculae, & Sulea, 2012), which requires capturing the essence of an artist’s style or of a period. Halfway from detection of plagiarisms and identification of pastiches, the recognition of textual reuses and citations helps to track the literary influences and the spirit of the epoch. Some of the textual reuses and citations are conscious, other not. They may correspond to explicit — or implicit — and more or less distorted quotations. Usually, textual reuses proceed by transforming a piece of text, while citations are verbatim, but it’s not always the case. When a sufficient part of the original text is kept, the fragments can be recognized. This is exactly what we attempt to do automatically here. Reuses and approximate citations are far more difficult to detect than plagiarisms, because the original fragments of text may be distorted, but far less than pastiches. Anyway, their detection could be of great interest for scholars interested in intertextuality.   3 Criteria As previously said, text reuse and citation discovery is inspired from plagiarism detection, but it has to take into account all the alterations that may have transformed the initial text. To precise the type of distortions that affect a text, we started from a hand made study realized by Tania Duclos who shows in (Duclos, 2013) [cf. figure 1] how some parts of the Human Comedy (Balzac, 1976-1981) reuse fragments of texts from Théophile Gautier. For instance, some of the passages highlighted in figure 1 are identical, while others are somehow different. For instance “en brocatelle à plis soutenus et puissants, s’entouraient de fraises godronnées” becomes “de brocatelle aux plis soutenus et puissants, les hautes fraises godronnées” and “des manches à crevés et à sabots de dentelles d’où la main sortait comme une fleur de sa capsule” becomes “les manches à crevés et à sabots de dentelles, dont la main sort comme le pistil du calice d’une fleur”. Lastly, some fragments look far more difficult to identify, because they are composed of isolated words or even different words (e.g. “diamants” and “pierreries” or “tableau” and “gravures”) of which meanings are closed. Here, we try to detect string homologies where some words may be missing, especially stop words, i.e. articles, pronouns or prepositions. It may also happen that the number and the genre of nouns, adjectives or verbs change as when “d’une main mignonne frappée de fossettes” is transformed in “des mains mignonnes frappées de fossettes”.   Figure 1: example of hand coded comparison (Duclos, 2013) between a fragment of Béatrix (Balzac, 1976-1981) on the left and a fragment of Théophile Gautier (Gautier, Portraits contemporains, 1874) on the right.   4 Detection of Fragments with Holes Among the more efficient existing plagiarism detection techniques, many are based on fingerprints built with the hash coding of character strings (Potthast, Eiselt, Barron-Cedeño, Stein, & Rosso, 2011), (Potthast, Stein, Barron-Cedeño, & Rosso, 2010), (Burrows, Tahaghoghi, & Zobel, 2006). Other techniques evaluate the statistical distribution of vocabulary with a vector space model of the texts and a cosine similarity measure that evaluate their closeness, however they don’t seem to be appropriate to our purpose, even if we use the distribution of words. We have implemented and adapted the fingerprint method and we have evaluated it on the reuses isolated by Tania Duclos. It helped us to optimize the values of the different parameters. To do this, we have first eliminated the “stop words”, i.e. article, preposition, pronoun, auxiliary verbs, etc. We have also used the Snowball (Porter, 2001) (Tomlinson, 2004) stemmer to reduce the words to their root, which allows being independent from the inflected forms used in the text. For instance, the words  “fishing”, “fished”, “fish”, “fishes” and “fisher” are reduced to the same root word “fish”.  The second part consists in extracting sequences of words characterized by their minimal size, i.e. by the minimal number of consecutive non-“stop words” they contain, which we call the window size. In addition, because we want to allow missing words, we also introduce possible holes. This means that a window of size 4 does not necessarily correspond to 4 consecutive words. Once the similar fragments are discovered, they are adjoined end to end, which build blocs. Lastly, we have manually defined what we call “weak words”, which are not very significant, and we filter the blocs of similar words of which number of non-“weak words” is bigger than a minimal threshold, for instance 4. This allows eliminating noise, without loosing a lot of information.    5 Obtained Results The program has been implemented in SWI-Prolog (cf. (SWI-Prolog's home)) using an external table to store hash-coded texts. It is quite efficient, for instance it took less than 10 minutes to index all the Balzac’s Human Comedy (Balzac, 1976-1981) that contains more than 25 millions of characters on a 2GHz MacPro. Then, it takes a couple of minutes to discover text reuses on entire novels. Using this program, we were able to retrieve all the handed coded reuses of (Duclos, 2013), except the “yellow” one (see figure 1). We have also detected many interesting citations and reuses, for instance a reuse of the Gautier’s Novel entitled “Mademoiselle de Maupin” (Gautier, Romans, contes et nouvelles, 2002) in the Balzac’s Novel “Modeste Mignon” (Balzac, 1976-1981), which has not been mentioned before, or a citation of Lyttleton both in “Delphine” (de Staël, 1869) and in “Ursule Mirouët” (Balzac, 1976-1981). We also tested the system between Lautréamont’s work (Lautréamont, 2009) and Buffon one the one hand and the French moralists like Pascal, La Rochefoucauld or La Bruyère on the other. We have retrieved many text reuses among which some interesting distortions like, for instance the Pascal aphorism “Nous naissons injustes; car chacun tend à soi: cela est contre tout ordre.” that has been rewritten in “Nous naissons justes. Chacun tend à soi. C'est envers l'ordre.”  6 Perspectives For the near future, we plan to extensively use our system in many fields of literature, especially on the 19th century French literature, with Balzac’s work, which is the aim of the PHOEBUS project funded by the CNRS. More precisely, PHOEBUS is intended to investigate the textual reuses between the Balzac’s youth novels and the Human Comedy, and between Balzac’s work and his contemporaries’ work like Théophile Gautier, Benjamin Constant, George Sand etc. We also plan to digitalize the journals where many authors published either under their own names, or anonymously and to compare them with the Human Comedy. Lastly, we will conduct a thorough comparison with similar approaches.  ",

       "abstract":"Though humanities graduates have long engaged in a wide range of stimulating careers, very little data has been collected on humanities scholars working outside the professoriate. Consequently, discussions about alternative academic careers—those within the orbit of universities and cultural heritage institutions, but off the tenure track—have been largely anecdotal. In order to ground the conversation, the Scholarly Communication Institute (SCI) initiated a study in 2012 to investigate perceptions about career preparation provided by graduate programs. The main goal of the study, which focused primarily on the context of North American higher education, was to establish a body of data that can serve as a foundation on which to base recommendations for new and revised methodological training. The results of the study reveal clear patterns that highlight the current strengths of graduate education relative to non-professorial employment, as well as significant opportunities for improvement.",

While the use of crowdsourcing is increasing, little work has been done to understand ways to organize the work to ensure that this crowd’s contribution is delivered within an academic’s project’s schedule, budget and other resources and to the required quality standard. This paper will contribute to this discussion by reviewing the literature to suggest a crowdsourcing process framework explore the range of decisions that must be addressed in advance to ensure quality and successful project outcomes. In addition, it will report on interviews with several crowdsourcing projects with regards to their workflow organization. The paper will conclude with recommendations for projects contemplating this tool as a way to reach project outcomes with limited project funds.",

Prior to copyright legislation and enforcement, literary texts as well as other non-fiction prose texts circulated promiscuously among newspapers as editors freely reprinted materials borrowed from other venues. What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences? By employing and developing computational linguistics tools to analyze the large textual databases of nineteenth-century newspapers newly available to scholars, this project will generate new knowledge of the nineteenth-century print public sphere.",

       "abstract":"Algorithmic text generators, Oulipo forms, and collaborative art practice has created “authorless” texts that deliberately reject the unity and “sensefulness” of single-author works. I explore the opposite question: Is it possible to create an authorless text that looks and acts exactly like a conventional, authored work? I present Exquisite Haiku, a real-time web application that makes it possible for groups to work together to compose short poems. Drawing inspiration from the Exquisite Corpse, a classic Surrealist parlor game, the software pushes the collaborative process down to the level of individual word selections. I argue that this creates “unattributable” texts that lack authors and yet cannot be distinguished from “normal” texts. Far from being without origin, though, the game that produces them can be understood as a real-world enactment, at the level of artistic praxis, of 20th century critical frameworks that formulate meaning as something produced by readers and their communities.",

With over 500 participants, the web project aims to collate archaeological experiences and connect archaeologists across the world, using a variety of digital technologies. The participants record and share their Day on the Wordpress-based DoA website: www.dayofarchaeology.com, alongside photo-sharing sites, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This paper will explore how the Day of Digital Humanities model has translated into a more defined discipline; what the DoA has learned from Day of Digital Humanities; the difficulties and benefits of the web-based model when applied to archaeology; how social media has been used; and what impact the DoA has had, and will have as it develops, for participants, the archaeology community and the wider public.",

It argues that the emergence of DH in its newly prominent forms during the past decade is closely connected to this larger shift in the collective imagination of the network. This context helps us understand the public role that DH might play in exploring multiple connections between digital and physical materialities out in the world. After summarizing he eversion and connected developments in DH, in conclusion I’ll suggest that games offer ways to think about the active role of DH in the ongoing eversion of the network, and about the engagement of humanities research with developments in the wider world.",

       "abstract":"Dream of the Red Chamber (DRC), written in the 18th century, is among the greatest Chinese classic novels. DRC has 120 chapters. In 1921, Hu Shi (胡適) provided solid evidence to show that the first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin (曹雪芹) based on his life. He also attributed the remaining 40 chapters to Gao E (高鶚). While the first conclusion is commonly accepted, the second is still not settled. In this paper we propose a text-mining approach to the DRC author attribution problem. We define a mining function to find terms that clearly show discrepancies between the two corpuses (Chapters 1-80 and Chapters 81-120). Some of the terms are semantic in nature, thus avoiding the pitfalls with the more syntactic function words approach. Our result supports the claim that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 were written by different authors.",

This paper demonstrates that although many literary texts published post-1922 are not deeply embedded within the Digital Humanities tradition due to their copyright status, these texts have a clear future as an object of study in the Digital Humanities. These amateur projects start without funding or faculty blessing and are thus free to explore the possibilities of connecting with these texts. The variety of amateur approaches and their usefulness reveals the need for careful decisions of how to interface with these print texts rather than rushing in to the most obvious approach.",

The main aim is to find out whether the characters in the novels are distinguishable as to their writing style. An additional question is whether the two co-authors of three of the novels can be identified in the letters of certain fictional characters. The method used is stylometric authorship attribution by means of an R-script developed by Eder, Rybicki and added to by Kestemont.",

Finding the next installment is also a manual process, and there are always problems with the OCR quality.

AfA is written in the functional language Clojure and builds on purely functional data structures. It heavily parallelizes computations, using agents for asynchronous processing. Per default AfA stores its results in an XML linking file and uses Neo4j for the visualization of networks of intertextuality, but other visualization components and comparison algorithms can be plugged in.

Nevertheless, because it is defined formally and generically, it is possible to build generic processing pipelines for LMNL, to support operations such as filtering, indexing, renaming and transformation.

       "abstract":"  From the middle ages to the early 20th century, a bewildering variety of calendars and dating methods was in use across Europe. This presentation will address issues involved in encoding historical dates during the early modern period, and look at strategies for enhancing computability and interoperability in date-encoding. Although other calendars are in use across the world, nearly all societies have adopted the Gregorian calendar to some degree; wherever you go in the modern world, the date and time are generally uncontroversial. In past centuries, this was far from true. Jardine (2009) cites the case of William of Orange, whose invasion fleet left the Netherlands on November 11, 1688, but landed in England on November 5, having negotiated not only the English Channel but also the ten-day discrepancy between the Gregorian calendar in use in the Netherlands and the Julian still used in England. The complicated history of the adoption of the new Gregorian calendar across Europe, between its introduction by Pope Gregory in 1582 and its final consolidation in the early part of the 20th century, is familiar to scholars (see for instance Cheney 2000 and Duncan 1998).  Our project, the Map of Early Modern London (MoEML), falls squarely within the period of maximum calendar confusion for England. The two principle sources of difficulty are the discrepancy between the Gregorian and Julian calendars (ten days during most of the period) and the change in New Year's Day, which from the 12th century onward was March 25 rather than January 1. The resulting ambiguity in actual dating is compounded by the ways in which writers, both in the period and after it, have chosen to deal with the difficulty. The terms \"Old Style\" and \"New Style\" (O.S. and N.S.) have been variously used to indicate the start-of-year convention in use, the leap-day adjustment between Julian and Gregorian calendars, or both; so if we see, for instance, \"February 11 1650 New Style\", it is by no means clear whether the date referred to would have been viewed by contemporaries as February 1 1650 (calendar adjustment), February 11 1649 (start-of-year adjustment), or February 1 1649 (both).  These issues of dating have been a major challenge for MoEML's encoders. Our collection of TEI born-digital documents and historical texts includes dates from many calendars. When we encode dates in historical texts, we first must determine which dating method was used by the clerk or author. Dates are given in terms of many possible systems: regnal years, papal years, mayoral years, legal terms, years calculated from a particular feast day, and even Anno Mundi figures (years since the creation of the world); we follow Cheney (2000) and Fryde (1986) in parsing these references and converting them to Julian dates. We give a few examples.  Julian date from primary source: \"Alfred king of the weſt Saxons, in the yere 886...\" (Stow 1598 8)  regnal date: “a par[l]iament being holden at Carlile in the [...] 35. of Edwarde the firſt\" (Stow 1598 11)  Anno Mundi dates, combined with proleptic Julian: \"[...] Eneas, the ſonne of Venus, daughter of Iupiter, aboute the yeare of the world 2855. the yeare before Chriſtes natiuitie, 1108. builded a Citie [...]\" (Stow 1598 1)  We also use a wide variety of modern sources such as the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The ODNB has precise methods of expressing uncertainties in dates and date ranges, but does not specify how uncertainties arise, which means we can determine precision from the ODNB but not accuracy. We have attempted to discover whether other projects are concerned with calendar issues, and if so, whether they have adopted similar encoding methods. A brief survey of the projects listed on the TEI Projects page (http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/) shows, at the time of writing, 152 projects in total. Of those, 68 projects could be expected to contain materials in the historical range that concerns us. We were able to retrieve XML from 19, 16 of which contained encoded dates that would be subject to calendar issues. Only three of those projects appear to have taken account of calendars in their encoding. The prevalent view is well expressed by Godfried Croenen (personal communication, 2012-10-05):  \"All medievalists use Julian dates to refer to any date before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, and so all the dates before the 16th century I have ever encoded into XML TEI documents are in Julian dates. I never felt it would be useful to convert these dates to Gregorian dates, as nobody would know what I was referring to.\"  Croenen also expresses doubt as to whether it is practical or useful to attempt date conversion between calendars. Others have pointed out that, where date encoding involves only the year, there is no reason to worry about the calendar, and one might as well encode using @when (whose datatype is explicitly Gregorian) with a Julian date. However, in the case of England between the 12th century and 1752, assuming Julian years amounts to an allowance that nearly one in four dates is likely to be wrong, because of the New Year issue. Another objection to regularizing all date-encoding to use Gregorian is that it is unconventional to use the Gregorian calendar proleptically. However, it is a long-standing practice to use the Julian calendar proleptically, referring to dates in antiquity — in fact, Stow does this in one of the examples above, in which he glosses the Anno Mundi date 2855 as 1108 BC.  In our encoding of dates for the MoEML project, we have two major concerns: that dates be as accurate as possible so that we know when an event occurred (or at least that the source and scope of inaccuracy be clearly expressed), and that they be computable. We are constructing an eventography, and we want to be able to plot event sequences on timelines. We would also like to be able to integrate our data with that of other early modern projects, many of which will have data from countries whose calendar usage varies substantially from English practice. As a result of these concerns, we are early adopters of some recently-added features of TEI that are intended to formalize accurate encoding of dates from differing calendars.  The original P5 attributes for encoding dates included two distinct classes: att.datable.w3c, and att.datable.iso. These two classes allow slightly different forms of date encoding (derived from XML Schema datatypes, and ISO 8601 respectively), but both are explicitly based on the Gregorian calendar. In other words, it is clearly wrong to encode a Julian date using one of these attributes:  *<birth when=\"1566\" calendar=\"#julianEngland\">1566</birth>  The recently-added att.datable.custom class remedies this deficiency by providing a full suite of dating attributes designed for non-Gregorian calendars, along with the @datingMethod attribute through which the calendar used can be specified (@calendar refers to the calendar used in the text content of a dating element, not its attributes). We can now encode a date with these attributes and Julian dates :  <birth when-custom=\"1566\" datingMethod=\"#julianEngland\" calendar=\"#julianEngland\">1566</birth> These tags show that both the attribute value and the text date use the Julian calendar. Given that our purpose is computability, though, the question arises: why not simply convert all our dates to (proleptic) Gregorian before encoding them? If we take the example above, this conversion would be the result:  <birth notBefore=\"1566-04-04\" notAfter=\"1567-04-03\" calendar=\"#julianEngland\">1566</birth>  The conversion, in accounting for the New Year issue and the leap day discrepancy, becomes a rather unwieldy range. Moreover, this conversion is itself computable, so it is unnecessary to impose this burden on our encoders. Instead, we encode Julian dates using @when-custom. On the website, we generate tooltips for all such dates showing the equivalent date or date-range in Gregorian. For the purposes of interoperability, the same conversion could be used to insert Gregorian dating attributes.  Until now, the encoding of historical dates in TEI projects appears to have been haphazard, for a variety of reasons, including the lack of adequate encoding mechanisms, academic convention, and historical practice. However, we now have a set of attributes that enable us to be more precise, and we can easily create conversion functions between (for instance) Julian and Gregorian dating systems. Moreover, as we begin to integrate data from different projects, and create timelines and event sequences that require accurate dating, there is more reason than ever for developing and propagating good practice in date encoding; we do not want to end up creating inter-project timelines in which (for example) the invasion force of William of Orange arrives in England several days before it sets off from the Netherlands. In presenting our date-encoding practices and the issues we have encountered, we hope to stimulate a discussion on accurate date encoding that will encourage those working on projects involving non-Gregorian calendars to be aware of the issues, and to collaborate in creating methods for encoding and interchange that will obviate these problems.

The approach uses named entity recognition and similarity metrics, and will result in a new dataset which enables each project to integrate information from the other.",

Together, these three projects aim to use digital technology to transform the field of Film and Media Studies, a discipline that has lagged English and History in the creation of high impact DH work. I would also like to suggest that the three interrelated projects demonstrate a productive model for scaffolding work in the Digital Humanities. The three sides of my work—enabling access, building tools, and text analysis—support and enhance one another.",

       "abstract":"The study of narrative is an essential part of understanding not only literature, but its appeal. So far, machine analysis of plot has been based on either mark-up based systems or formal models of plot, both of which rely extensively on models or experience found outside the corpus under review. This paper presents a new approach that learns the structure and details of plot directly from the corpus itself in an unsupervised fashion. This technique, adapted from stylometry, is demonstrated with a corpus of romance novels, showing that while the genre is somewhat formulaic, several discrete narrative strategies emerge as important - showing the genre is, in fact, composed of several formulas. This novel approach to observing, rather than preconceiving, plot structure opens a new horizon for stylometric tools.",

The book argues that Platonic writing, like Socratic speaking, is designed to turn us towards ideals of speaking and acting capable of transforming our lives and the community in which we live. In this short paper, I propose to offer a brief overview of the basic philosophical argument of the book in order then to turn in more detail to the logistics of how the enhanced digital book will be designed to further cultivate a community of readers capable of performing the politics of reading and writing for which the book itself argues. Conclusions will be drawn about the affordances and limitations of using digital media, particularly social media, to perform rigorous and public scholarly research in philosophy.",

Depicting uncertainty has been the object of study of many scholars, however, its application to cultural heritage visualizations, whose shapes are dictated by those of the objects being represented, poses particular issues and constraints. This is even more problematic in the case of automatically generated visualizations. This presentation will address this problem and consider what possible steps can be taken to depict uncertainty and imprecision within automated visualizations of bookbinding structures. This presentation is intended to serve as an example of the kind of perceptually salient graphical variables that can be used to successfully depict uncertainty and imprecision within cultural heritage prototypical diagrams.",

       "abstract":"In Computational Linguistics, language identification of text is generally considered a solved problem—but these methods assume that a text is monolingual, and at least 100 characters long. However, such methods cannot be used for multilingual texts in which the author switches between languages within a sentence, as in the “Chymistry of Isaac Newton”, a collection of writings on alchemy by Newton. In these documents, Newton often switches between English, Latin, and French, even within sentences. For this reason, we have developed a new method for automatically identifying the language for single words rather than for complete texts.",

Recent research trends in the Humanities in general and in Digital Humanities in particular are no exception in this respect. The goal of the present paper is threefold: (i) to survey different types of scientific visualizations needed for language data, (ii) to describe a set of web applications that have been implemented in the context of the CLARIN-D project , and (iii) to demonstrate the added value of visualization.",

This DH2013 presentation on the Slave Biographies project will not only give a comprehensive overview of the project but will outline the challenges of dealing with large historical datasets. However, what is most exciting about the project is that by bringing together large sets of data, we cannot only do large calculations and visualizations about the historical practices of slavery, but we can drill down to find rich representations of individuals and families, giving life to the individual biographies of slaves and their relations and contexts.",

Against the backdrop of the on-going sesquicentennial commemorations, we examine the intersection of humanities, social media, and computing to probe enduring questions around the legacy of the Civil War. We illustrate how an ongoing study that uses the Civil War serves as a testbed for examining and developing techniques to conduct traditional types of humanistic inquiry in the context of the social web. Our results demonstrate how careful analysis of the online discourse that occurs across the social web enables deeper understanding of how the Lost Cause Ideology continues to recast the origins of the war and minimize the role of slavery.",

In this paper we focus on the key findings of the pilot stage of the ‘Hidden Histories’ project. We will demonstrate that Oral History is an important and productive methodology in such research and that it has resulted in the creation of primary sources that not only offer new information and interpretations of the field but that can also be used for further historical research.",

       "abstract":"  This paper describes an experimental approach to designing and teaching an introductory digital humanities course for graduate students. In 2011 Kevin Kee was asked to create and teach a class as part of a new interdisciplinary Humanities Ph.D. program. The graduate students taking the course would be largely unfamiliar with the digital humanities. Kee began his preparation for the course by asking several questions. The first was \"what should an introductory digital humanities course attempt to accomplish\"? As he searched for answers, another important question emerged: \"How could digital methods be used to design and deliver the course?\" In this paper, Kee and Spencer Roberts, a Research Assistant who worked with Kee, describe first their method for researching and designing the course. They then sketch the structure and content of the course that resulted from their research. Finally, they provide examples of student responses to the material and methods covered in the course (including Roberts's perspective as a graduate student). The collected responses and their reflections on the process suggest particular ways in which future courses of this kind might be designed, implemented, and improved. Most importantly, they found that an effective way to design and teach an introductory digital humanities course is to think about the discipline through discussions about its topics and to think with the discipline by using digital tools and methods in the classroom. Overviews of digital humanities course offerings have been conducted throughout the past fifteen years. In 1999, Willard McCarty and Matthew Kirschenbaum identified only fourteen institutions that offered courses in humanities computing. In 2006, Melissa Terras conducted another survey of digital humanities curriculum, and in 2011, Lisa Spiro undertook to collect and analyze syllabi from digital humanities courses. Of these previous surveys, Spiro’s was the most comprehensive; she collected over 134 syllabi from various levels of study in the digital humanities. Although Spiro’s work parallels and was helpful to that of Kee and Roberts, the latter were unaware of her project when they began, and had no way to replicate her research method. As a result, Kee and Roberts drew on the results of their own analyses while designing the course. For Kee and Roberts' research, Roberts designed a method by which syllabi were converted into sets of data representing reading lists, assignments, assessment methods, and digital tools used. Commonly occurring items from within those sets were highlighted and identified as items deemed important by the statistical consensus of instructors represented in their sample. For example, their results showed that seven authors of digital humanities-related articles and books appeared on reading lists at a significantly higher frequency than others; the data also showed that other instructors found these authors most useful. Kee drew on these results when deciding on readings for his course list. Topics covered in the course included text encoding and markup, distant reading, building, mapping, modelling and simulating, playing and gaming, teaching, and collaborating. Each of these was paired with a practical application, usually drawn from a modified version of William Turkel’s \"Method\". For example, students learned the theory of text markup and were asked to create pages on the course wiki using the basic wiki standard markup. Franco Moretti’s theory of distant reading made more sense for students once they experimented with text mining and analysis tools such as Voyant. Kee’s assessment strategy required students to use blogs and Twitter to comment on the theories and tools they encountered; Kee also encouraged them to participate in scholarly discourse that occurs on the Web. Although most of the students studied history, Kee aimed to create an environment in which the digital humanities were understood as both theory and practice that could be incorporated into any humanities discipline. Because Kee and Roberts hoped to learn from the experiences of graduate students new to the digital humanities, Kee built feedback mechanisms into the course assignments, and asked students to reflect on the course before and after completion. Nearly all of the students were challenged by the dual responsibility of learning theory and skills simultaneously. Although some students were relieved to finish experimenting, others were pleased with their progress and the opportunities for future research. One student commented, “Not only do I now have some new tools to use while I’m doing research… I’m also more open-minded towards using them in the first place and really trying to engage with them, rather than brushing them off.” While students readily adopted some of the tools, such as Zotero and Evernote, they found more complex tools such as DevonThink or Voyant required a level of commitment and time they did not want to make. In short, these students were not willing to commit to a new, digital research method at a time when they were simultaneously taking graduate courses rooted in conventional research methods. For some students, however, patience led to late or accidental discoveries that improved their methods; in at least one case, a student who was skeptical throughout the course became an enthusiastic supporter of digital methods and now avidly attends DH conferences and events. At the conclusion of the course, most students were open to the various theories and approaches used in the digital humanities, and were enthusiastic about trying new tools and experimenting with new methods that might improve their research and scholarship. From the outset of the project, Kee and Roberts understood that they were asking questions for which there were several feasible answers. Some graduate level digital humanities courses focus on topics within the digital humanities; others primarily train students to develop digital skills using computational tools. Kee's approach was to combine these two approaches into one course that provided opportunity for theoretical discussion while also showcasing practical applications, so that students could see the potential beneDits of digital humanities methods without having to master sophisticated tools. The research method used to build the course syllabus employed the same theories and tools that were later discussed in the course, creating an iterative loop through which student feedback and developments in the discipline can be incorporated into future versions. Already there are new tools to improve the collection and analysis of digital humanities syllabi, and new methods being explored by instructors. Through the experimental approach described in this paper, Kee and Roberts have found that thinking about and thinking with the discipline, a method that many digital scholars employ in their research, is also an effective way to design a course, and appeals to students who are new to the discipline, fostering enthusiasm for its use in their own often conventional humanities scholarship. The authors hope that this approach contributes to the growing conversation about teaching digital humanities, while also reflecting and adapting to the dynamic topics within the field.   ",

Dyadic pulsations correspond to new communication exchanges occurring between two participants in a discussion group. A group that continuously integrates new participants in the on-going conversation is characterized by a steady dyadic pulsation rhythm. On the contrary, groups that either pursue close conversation or unilateral communication have no or very little dyadic pulsations. We show on two examples taken from Usenet discussion groups, that dyadic pulsations permit to anticipate future bursts in response delay time which are signs of group discussion collapses. We discuss ways of making this measure resilient to spam and other common algorithmic production that pollutes real discussions.",

       "abstract":"  Who is represented within digital humanities and how? This question guides our paper, which focuses on dynamics of representation and exclusion within digital humanities. The field has been subject to a range of criticisms, from its very definition to its relationship to data, building, and hacking. Yet, only recently have scholars begun to raise questions about raced, gendered, and heterosexist assumptions within digital humanities. By exploring these assumptions, we take up the question of how to define digital humanities in ways that are not radically reductive.  Authors Peter Lunenfeld, Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Todd Presner and Jeffrey Schnapp write the following in their new book from MIT Press, Digital_Humanities: Perhaps, then, the utopian impulse of the Digital Humanities can be characterized as a modality of radically opening discourse to participation for everyone. What if there were no conditions on participation? What if utterances were neither admitted nor denied based on gender, sex, race, ethnicity, language, location, nationality, class, or access to technology? We are not saying that these facticities do not matter or cease to matter in the digital world; instead, we are saying that the utopian element of the Digital Humanities is to at least posit, if not fully enable, a future in which participation is possible for everyone, anywhere, anytime. It would be as if it were possible to bring about a public sphere in which no one was excluded. This is a core human value of the Digital Humanities. (95) The authors present DH as a “work around” for the issues of race, class, and gender as they have been posited in the “zero-sum game” of the culture wars that have been taking place in the humanities (and elsewhere) for more than 50 years (23-24). We contend that in order for us to even approach the Utopian future of creating a public sphere in which no one is excluded, we cannot work around these issues, but instead confront them head on. The inequities are still too great to ignore. At the heart of this question is the very definition of “digital humanist.” Ernesto Priego has outlined what he calls the new “super-humanist” who can quote literary theory and create DH interfaces from scratch. Are these super-humanists, armed with large research grants, hardware, and human capital, becoming the “face” of not just DH but the humanities in general? If this is, in fact, the presumptive definition of “digital humanist,” what roles are available to academics and aspiring academics without access to the resources, support, and training that seem to be necessary to be a successful digital humanist? How are gendered, racialized, and queer bodies represented or not represented in such an articulation of DH? How can we begin to address multiple forms of privilege that proliferate in DH? Does DH challenge existing authority structures that define in-group and out-group status? Is it a tool for dismantling those structures? With these questions in mind, this paper draws attention to the fraught relationship between DH and those who have been marginalized and silenced within traditional power structures both within and outside of academia. As illustrated by Amy Earhart, in her essay in Debates in the Digital Humanities, the promise of open and egalitarian access to materials has largely turned into a funding arms race prioritizing the same texts and projects long favored by academia. In the same collection, Tara McPherson raises questions about the historical separation of technology from studies of race. Accounting for these concerns, who has access and the ability to really do digital humanities? Is digital humanities egalitarian, or is it opening the door to a new elite? Cherie Ann Turpin recently investigate the National Endowment of the Humanities funding numbers to understand who was being funded and found that the vast majority of them went to large, R1 institutions and not HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), Primarily Hispanic Institutions, or regional public college, which are often located in rural and/or economically depressed areas. Not only are the kinds of projects being funded not representative, neither are the kinds of institutions, limiting the size, scope, and reach of DH.  The questions of representation within digital humanities that we raise take many forms but center around the tension between macro and microscales of legibility and labor that emerge as scholars define digital humanities. For example, if big data repositories or significant digital archives translated into visualization platforms come to symbolize the work of digital humanities, who is counted and uncounted by absences in big data and silences in the archive? If we foreground technologies and metaphors of visualization and mapping, how do we navigate the imperialist histories that will inevitably be encoded in the structures of digital humanities? We are arguing, as have scholars like Alan Liu, that the collaboration sequence, and its implied hierarchy, needs to be questioned. To borrow and repurpose some phrases from Gayatri Spivak, the active ideology of imperialism provides the discursive field from which the Digital Humanities emerges as both a discipline and a signifier. Through such definitions of digital humanities, we examine the likely effects on labor, particularly labor performed by women and people of color, who are already plagued with disproportionate service demands in the name of diversity. We will examine where digital humanities fits in with demands on our time made by academic institutions and how we render digital humanities work visible and legible within the broader trajectories of our careers. As put by Julie Flanders, the time and effort that staff who work in DH centers is measured in fundamentally different ways than a “normal” academic. We will discuss further whether digital humanities labor “counts” as teaching, research, or service and propose how those of us in marginal spaces within the academy might best advocate for how digital work is evaluated in our professional portfolios. As such, this paper outlines the issues faced by individuals whose identities render their work marginal or invisible within stringent definitions of digital humanities, identifying solutions for redressing these inequalities.

In this presentation, we will discuss how working within such a radically interdisciplinary context has already led us to new insights about poetry, its features, and its operations. Our focus in this short paper will be not on the technology, but on how working collaboratively with visualization scientists has _in itself, independently_ of the technology, led us to new insights about poetry. For this reason, we argue, the practice of collaboration across the boundaries of very different disciplines has its own inherent value, even to a discipline like ours in which work and the “freedom to explore” has most traditionally been associated with solitude.",

Using a corpus of 19th Century British novels as a case study, the author begins with a descriptive quantitative analysis of character names, developing a set of stylized facts about the way narratives allocate attention to their characters. The author shows that narrative attention in many novels appears to follow a “long tail” distribution. The author then constructs an explanatory model in NetLogo, demonstrating that basic assumptions about plot structure are sufficient to generate output consistent with the real novels in the corpus.",

       "abstract":"Google's linguistic prosthesis have become common mediators between our intended queries and their actual expressions. By correcting a mistyped word or extending a small string of letters into a statistically plausible continuation, Google offers a valuable service to users. However, Google might also be transforming a keyword with no or little value into a keyword for which bids are more likely. Since Google's word bidding algorithm accounts for most of the company's revenues, it is reasonable to ask whether linguistic prosthesis are biased towards commercially more interesting expressions. This study describes a method allowing for progressing in this understanding. Based on an optimal experiment design algorithm, we are reconstructing a model of Google's autocompletion and value assignment functions. We can then explore and question the various possible correlations between the two functions. This is a first step towards the larger goal of understanding how Google's linguistic economy impacts natural language.",

       "abstract":"  A key challenge facing professional researchers in the domain of cultural heritage across Europe and worldwide is the interrogation of growing digital humanities collections. However, the full value of these heritage treasures is not being realised. After digitisation, these collections are typically monolithic, difficult to navigate and can contain text which is highly variable in terms of language, spelling, punctuation, and consistency of terminology. These difficulties are compounded by a lack of normalised spelling in most European languages before the eighteenth century. This means that search across these digital collections tends to return sub-par results as multiple spellings for many common words are treated as independent document keywords. CULTURA is a corpus agnostic environment with a suite of services, including personalisation, annotation, and recommendation, providing necessary supports and features for a diverse range of professional researchers. In order to empower communities of researchers with personalised mechanisms which support the collaborative exploration, interrogation and interpretation of complex digital cultural artefacts, the adaptivity provided in CULTURA is required to be integrated and intelligent. The next generation adaptivity provided by CULTURA supports the dynamic composition and presentation of digital cultural heritage resources. Automated adaptivity however, is not enough on its own. Ensuring that the user is in control of the personalisation process is essential. Such user-centred control is enhanced through correlating usage patterns with self-expressed user goals; pre-defined strategies (e.g. research strategies, investigation strategies, discovery strategies, explanatory strategies etc.); and the provision of appropriate tools for users to explore and navigate large cultural heritage information spaces. A central aspect of the CULTURA environment is its use of rich metadata (user generated, computer generated and expert generated) coupled with natural language processing, entity extraction and social network analysis techniques, in order to support collaborative exploration, interrogation and interpretation of the underlying cultural resources. The Qviz (http://www.qviz.eu) project has some similarities in approach to the CULTURA project in that it makes explicit recognition of the value of users as members of communities, and as contributors to digital cultural heritage collections, however Qviz, however, does not incorporate a personalised or adaptive aspect. The manual determination of descriptive metadata across a large corpus is too time-consuming to be practical. For example, the process of metadata identification for the 8,000 1641 depositions took a research assistant 12 months (http://1641.tcd.ie). An automated entity extraction process is used by the CULTURA project (Carmel et al. 2012). This process interprets words and combinations of words to identify entities in the corpus such as people, places, events, and dates. Complex entities are then constructed from these entities and the corpus allowing the identification of events, such as WHO did WHAT on such a DATE at a specific LOCATION.  Entity extraction is most powerful on a corpus in which all the content has been normalised as entities can be matched across multiple documents. To enable normalisation a ground-truth is manually generated across a proportion of the corpus, approximately 10% in the case of the 1641 depositions (Hampson et al. 2012). The ground-truth assigns non-normalised terms in the corpus to normalised terms. The ground-truth is applied in the generation of a statistical model that is then utilised on the entire corpus outputting a normalised corpus. It is this normalised content from which entities are identified and extracted. The linguistic model used in the normalisation of the 1641 Depositions has proved highly reusable, and provides robust results when applied to a range of other material contemporary to the corpus used to generate the model, enabling the re-use of the model on additional content collections. The output of these processes ensures each individual piece of content from the corpus has descriptive metadata in the form of individual entities such as a person or place, and complex entities such as where a person lived (i.e. compound entities) as well as a normalised variant. This enables a simple keyword search to provide results that cover the entire corpus and all variants of spelling of the terms entered. Additionally, and more significantly, individual pieces of content from within the corpus can be linked to other content that contains information on the same event or similar events, based on the date, location, people, and type of event. These links enable professional researchers to quickly identify content that is related to their current research topic, by way of visualisations of these links (Hampson et.al. 2012). While the automated tools are providing useful results for professional researchers, these state-of-the-art tools cannot replace the insight and experience of a professional researcher. These insights can be captured via an annotation tool that can be used to annotate specific aspects of any piece of content, both textual and visual. Annotations can be at any level, from a single word up to the entire document, or any user-identified region of an image. Annotations also allow the researcher to link the identified content to any other document within the corpus. Links such as this feed a professional researcher’s knowledge into the system, and can be used to aid in the adaptivity and personalisation of the system for all users. Collaboration between professional researchers occurs in an implicit manner via the use of annotations as link generation between content, which feeds into recommendations and personalisation. Explicit collaboration is also present in CULTURA. Researchers can share annotations with other users, enabling the propagation of insights and discoveries in the content. As annotations are anchored to specific elements of a document they provide a powerful mechanism for inserting detailed and relevant knowledge. This knowledge can be made available to either groups of researchers or all researchers thus enabling a greater collaboration across all users of the environment. The CULTURA environment has already been used by professional researchers in the course of their research. Services including annotations, document level notes, and multi-dimensional recommendations of content were enabled within the environment. A number of the professional researchers involved in trials of the CULTURA environment were initially wary of the potential impact of adaptivity on their research. They expressed concern that the recommendation system would create a ‘filter bubble’, distorting the appearance of the collection. As they engaged with the environment, however, these concerns were abated. Research into the user requirements of these end-users had identified this concern, and a concomitant need for a high level of scrutability. In line with this, recommendations made by the CULTURA engine were very explicitly presented in a way that made it easy for researchers to decide whether to use them, or to ignore their suggestions. In addition, the interface made it clear why a given user was being recommended a particular piece of content. After some initial caution, professional researchers agreed that the adaptive recommendations provided by CULTURA were genuinely useful. This was especially true of researchers who were previously unfamiliar with the CULTURA corpora. These users reported that the recommendations facilitated their mastery of the collection. Researchers who had greater familiarity with the collection rated the utility of the recommendations less highly, but still expressed an appreciation of their potential usefulness. In particular, they suggested that the recommendations were valuable in encouraging them to look at the collection in new ways. The user model for the professional researchers was evaluated and determined to be an accurate reflection of the researcher’s interests and topics under research. While some anomalies were identified in the user model, the areas of interest that were weighted most highly correlated with the topics of the research. The CULTURA environment is currently engaged in additional evaluations with trainee researchers utilising a broader set of documents, tools, and adaptivity.  ",

       "abstract":"*Noh* is a classical Japanese stage art involving singing and dancing accompanied by music. It is natural that the author’s preference is considerably revealed in the play, both in the texts and songs. The standard rhythm in Noh is _“Hira-nori,”_ in which the seven-and-five syllable meter, that is, 7+5=12 characters will correspond to eight beats(16 half-beats). A sentence is called _“Haritsu”_(broken rhythmically) if many phrases have extra syllables or have insufficient number of syllables compared with standard meter. In particular, the _“Kuse”_ part is the most important part in a Noh play and should be composed of _Haritsu_ sentences. We prepared more than 3000 phrases of the _Kuse_ data from over 70 Noh plays, and analyzed the data. We mainly studied the distribution of *Zeami’s Noh* plays among other plays. As we expected, the authorship was *well revealed* in the _Kuse_ part, and validated the power of multivaliate analysis.",

       "abstract":"   Introduction The role of annotations in digital humanities is well known and documented (Agosti et al., 2004, 2007) (Bélanger, 2010). Subsequently, many different tools which allow for the annotation of digital humanities content have been developed. Unfortunately, tools designed specifically for an individual portal are typically only compatible with that system. More general solutions, which can be easily distributed across various sites, have been produced, but these systems often have limited functionality (only annotating a single content type, no sharing features etc.) (Okfn) (TILE, 2011).  FAST-CAT (Flexible Annotation Semantic Tool — Content Annotation Tool) is a generic annotation system that directly addresses this challenge by implementing a convenient and powerful means of annotating digital content. It provides a reliable, portable manner of annotating both textual and image content in documents. The annotations are stored remotely by the FAST service which means that they may be shared across different sites maintaining the same data without the need for modification. FAST-CAT has been developed as a module for the Drupal 7 content management system making it extremely easy to add to an existing Drupal site.  This paper introduces FAST, the backend service providing powerful annotation functionalities, and CAT, the frontend Web annotation tool, and discusses how its features are tackling important challenges within the Digital Humanities field.   Features of FAST The FAST annotation service adopts and implements the formal model for annotations proposed by (Agosti and Ferro, 2008). Since then, FAST has been completely reengineered with added functionality such as provenance, logging and extended searching. According to this model, an annotation is a compound multimedia object which is constituted by different signs of annotation. Each sign materializes part of the annotation itself; for example, a textual sign would contain the textual content of the annotation, an image sign would contain images, etc. Each sign is characterized by one or more meanings of annotation, which specify the semantics of the sign, e.g. a sign whose meaning corresponds to the “title” field in the Dublin Core (DC) metadata schema or a sign carrying a question from the author whose meaning may be “question” or similar. The flexibility inherent in the annotation model allows us to create a connective structure, which is superimposed to the underlying documents managed by digital libraries. This can span and cross the boundaries of different digital libraries and the Web, allowing the users to create new paths and connections among resources at a global scale. FAST defines three different scopes which determine the visibility of an annotation — private, public and group. With FAST-CAT, the scope of an annotation is set to private by default, meaning that only the person who created the annotation can see it. These annotations may serve as reminders or notes within the document for the user, akin to writing in the margin of a page.  The user can choose to make an annotation public, allowing other users to read their comments on a document. This has numerous applications for users of all levels of expertise. For instance, experienced users may choose to create public notes and annotations which can expand on the text of the document, helping less experienced users to comprehend the content. Less experienced users may indicate parts of the document which they would like to be explained further.  Group annotations allow users to provide viewing and editing permissions on an annotation to specific users. This means that a team of people working towards a similar goal could communicate directly through the medium of annotation. In this way, it can be seen that FAST-CAT can play a crucial role in collaboration.   Features of CAT CAT is a web annotation tool whose development began in July 2012. It has been developed with the goal of being able to annotate multiple forms of document content and assist in collaboration in the field of digital humanities. At present, CAT allows for the annotation of both text and images. The current granularity for annotation of text is at the level of the letter. For image annotations, the granularity is at the level of the pixel. This allows for extremely precise document annotation, which is very relevant to the Digital Humanities domain due to the variety of different assets that prevail.  There are two types of annotation which may be created using CAT; a targeted annotation and a note. A targeted annotation is a comment which is associated with a specific part of the document. This may be a paragraph, a picture or an individual word, but the defining feature is that the text is directly associated with a specific entity. Conversely, a note is simply attached to the document. It is not associated with a specific item therein. Typically, this serves as a general comment or remark about the document as a whole. Further to allowing a user to comment on document text, the annotations created using CAT allow a user to link their annotations to other, external sources. Hence CAT can be used to construct a narrative through a number of documents. This is hugely beneficial for teachers using digital cultural collections and for students from primary to university level. For example, using these links a teacher can construct a predetermined path for their students to follow through a series of sites relevant to their chosen topic. Importantly, each link has comment text associated with it, allowing an educator to explain why this specific link is important or what the student should seek to gain from following this particular path. While CAT is beneficial for researchers and educators, it is also being used as an important source of user data for the content provider. Websites such as Amazon and YouTube are able to provide increasingly accurate recommendations for their individual users. These recommendations are facilitated by a user model which is driven by a combination of ratings, recently viewed items and numerous other factors. For a digital humanities site, annotations provide an insight into which entities are of interest to a user. If a user is frequently annotating a document, it is likely that this document is of interest to them. Furthermore, if the text being annotated is analysed, it may be possible to discern specific items of interest within the document. A digital humanities site which can determine what a user is attempting to study, then anticipate and recommend sources that may be of use to them in the future is profoundly useful. If well implemented, curators of digital humanities portals will see a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness with which researchers interact with their domain.   FAST-CAT and CULTURA At present, FAST-CAT is being developed as part of the CULTURA project (Hampson et al., 2012a, 2012b). A key aspect of CULTURA is the production of an online environment that empowers users, of various levels of expertise, to investigate, comprehend and contribute to digital cultural collections. FAST-CAT is a key component of this environment and is currently being trialled with the help of three different user groups. A team of MPhil students and professional researchers will use the tool as part of their teaching, collaboration and research into the 1641 depositions. These users will be testing FAST-CAT in a free form manner. How they choose to annotate and what content they label is entirely determined by their own needs. The 1641 depositions are text only content, so these students will serve only to evaluate the text annotation aspect of the tool. Providing an alternative insight is a group of secondary school students from Lancaster whose teacher will use the annotations to guide them through a lesson. These students will also be working with the 1641 depositions. Masters students in Padua will test the image annotation functionality of FAST-CAT as part of their research into the IPSA collections of illuminated manuscripts. Similarly to the MPhil students, their approach to annotating documents will be determined by their own research methodology. The various features offered by FAST-CAT and its user interface will be evaluated in detail and comparisons will be drawn between the manner in which different user groups availed of annotations depending on their level of expertise and document content. Furthermore, FAST-CAT will also help to drive CULTURA’s comprehensive user model by providing the site with updates on the user’s behaviour regarding document annotation.   Future Work Much of the further enhancement of FAST-CAT will be based on the feedback given by the user groups mentioned in the previous section. However there are already plans to expand and improve the system for future versions. While FAST-CAT is supported by modern browsers, to improve portability, implementations for older web browsers will be developed. FAST-CAT is a Drupal 7 module which means that, at present, it is only available for the annotation of websites which are built using the Drupal content management system. However, it only utilises a small amount of Drupal functionality to relay messages from the client computer to FAST. This dependency is easily removed as the majority of functionality is either client side or independent of Drupal. Designing and implementing a more server agnostic php script will allow FAST-CAT to be deployed on any website. This is one of the main items for future development of the system and will help to ensure that FAST-CAT can be utilised by as wide a range of content based websites as possible.   ",

The present work, funded by an NEH Digital Start-up Grant and an ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship, addresses this lack by developing methodologies for computer identification of dance movements in 3-D, through initial work towards the ability to have computer analysis and tagging of 2-D dance film. In addition we have developed an ontology and identified movement patterns relative to natural language ‘terms’ (conceptual metaphor). Finally, we have conducted a “deep reading” of the dance texts to classify movement into metaphoric concepts.",

Unlike the sciences - who have an established tradition of public advocacy and media communication - the humanities have no consistent, planned tradition of advocacy. This paper argues for planned humanities advocacy using the affordances of the digital humanities. In particular, it discusses how the 4Humanities initiative is leveraging DH for next-generation advocacy through text analysis of pubic discourse about the humanities and crowd-sourced generation of arguments for the humanities; by showing how statistics and other evidence about the contribution of the humanities to society can be analyzed and visualized; and by discussing how DH can provide special tools for humanities advocacy, while humanities advocacy can in return incentivize the creation of next-generation DH research and teaching tools.",

       "abstract":"Renear (2000) introduces the term \"transcriptional markup\" with a general and loose sense of pertaining to the reproduction of an existing text, and he does not attempt to define transcription per se. In recent years Huitfeldt and Sperberg-McQueen (2008), and Huitfeldt, Marcoux, and Sperberg-McQueen (2009, 2010) have developed a model of transcription (hereafter the HMS model) that they believe \"provides a sort of greatest common denominator for markup systems\" (2010, p. 15). But an awkward gap exists between the HMS model's abstract components and the realities of, for example, the TEI markup language and its typical usage. Here I make the case for a kind of markup — perfectly possible though in practice improbable — which bridges that gap. I call it pure transcriptional markup because it refines the sense of Renear's term and grounds it in an actual, formally specified model of transcription.",

It supports unformatted data entry of the names of the senders and addressees by auto-completion based on external catalogues, e.g., the Deutsche Nationalbibliografie. Additional information which is automatically extracted from the catalogues helps the philologist identify uniquely the scholars. Moreover, the platform allows the philologist input the date of the letter in various formats, e.g., \"early January 1798\", \"Eastern 1770\", \"mid-April 1770\", \"15.-20.04.1770\". The conversion of the entry to an exact date or a period is automatically done by the system. After the date is entered, the system provides additional historical information on historical events (extracted from chronicals) that took place immediately before or immediately after that date.",

It is applied in various disciplines within the humanities, with linguistics, sign language and gesture research represented most prominently in its user base. This paper highlights new developments in ELAN with an emphasis on those features that introduced new technological and methodological approaches to analysing both audio/video and derived textual data. We focus on improvements to the workflow of researchers as a result of the introduction of task oriented modes and on how the scope of the program has been expanded by implementing a framework for computational annotation creation modules and by connecting to web services that apply computational techniques for the same purpose.",

       "abstract":"We present work in jointly inferring the unique individuals as well as their social rank within a collection of letters from an Old Assyrian trade colony settled by merchants from the ancient city of Assur for approximately 200 years between 1950-1750 BCE, the height of the Middle Bronze Age. Using a probabilistic latent-variable model, we leverage pairwise social differences between names in cuneiform tablets to infer a single underlying social order that best explains the data we observe. Evaluating our output with published judgments by domain experts suggests that our method may be used for building informed hypotheses that are driven by data, and that may offer promising avenues for directed research by Assyriologists.",

       "abstract":"Bibliopedia, which recently completed an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant, performs data-mining and cross-referencing of scholarly literature to create a humanities-centered collaboratory. It uses semantic web technology to enable automated textual analysis, data extraction, cross-referencing, and visualizations of the relationships among texts and authors. Using existing open source software, it extracts citation data from existing plain text resources and transforms them into linked open data. This process makes the information easily accessible to the wider scholarly and linked data communities, enables network visualizations of the scholarly landscape. This short paper uses the lessons learned from Bibliopedia to argue for the necessity and usefulness of adopting semantic web technologies in digital humanities research projects. This paper also argues for the benefit of deploying open source technologies whenever possible, a method that has enabled a small team to construct a working prototype of a complex system in a short time.",

We extract and build character interaction networks in the form of weighted graphs from a database of scripts, compute various informative properties from the resulting networks (e.g. clustering coefficient), and construct logistic regression and decision tree classifiers based on these properties that distinguish between a multitude of characteristics that define movies and plays, such as media type, publication date, and genre. Finally, we discuss the successes and failures of using automated classification for specific characteristics on such limited input and strive to formulate intuitive explanations of the results.",

VizOR is built on top of a MySQL database comprised of the complete text of Only Revolutions and is programmed in Python to produce a dynamic, database-driven visualization of the novel. In this paper, we discuss the methods and procedures we are currently developing to create this visualization and highlight the implications of these methods and procedures for theoretical concerns in both digital humanities and media studies. This project, we propose, is both a re-reading of and an exploration of the process of reading Danielewski’s novel: as such, it joins the novel in examining the interrelation of human and machine “reading” and “authorship,” pointing to a procedural understanding of reading and writing and suggesting that both activities occur across a wide variety of actors and platforms.",

How do we engage knowledge-building communities and capture process, dialogue and connections in and around the electronic scholarly edition? NewRadial is a prototype scholarly edition environment developed to address such queries. However, its unification of primary texts, secondary scholarship and related knowledge communities, and its re-presentation of the digital scholarly edition as a social edition, an open work and a shared space where users collaboratively explore, sort, group, annotate and contribute to secondary scholarship creation, makes it both a model and prototype for alternative ways of working with and contributing to data-centric humanities research online. Its unique lens — through which a diverse collection of digital humanities objects can be re-imagined, freely explored and iteratively prototyped — is also an argument advocating for evolutions in humanities theory and praxis.",

One of the fundamental challenges faced by the project is the development of an interoperable data model. In this paper we describe the project’s overall objectives and the ontology that we are using to support the AustESE Workbench. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of an integrated workbench as it relates to several case studies.",

The system integrated with the new achievements in audio-video recognition will allow querying media files with predefined gesture phases (or motion primitives) and speech characteristics as well as combinations of both. For the purpose of this work the predefined motions and speech characteristics are called patterns for atomic elements and actions for a sequence of patterns. The main assumption is that a user-customized library of patterns and actions and automated media annotation with LMQI will reduce annotation time, hence decreasing costs of creation of annotated corpora. Increase of the number of annotated data should influence the speed and number of possible research in disciplines in which human multi-modal interaction is a subject of interest and where annotated corpora are required.",

Using data gathered from web analytics and user surveys, it will show that, although digitization has clearly benefitted users who operate in an information-rich environment, these benefits do not extend evenly across society, or even academia. As a result, I have created an alternative geographical visualization to demonstrate this problem, based upon the location of subscribing institutions rather than individual users. In combination, these will back up the main argument of this paper: that the subscription-based model of digitization does not ensure universal access to valuable content, but instead reinforces the divide between information-rich and information-poor communities.",

This paper describes the use of cellular automata to model feature diffusion as the adaptive aspect of the complex system of speech. Throughout hundreds of iterations that correspond to the daily interaction of speakers across time, we can watch regional distributional patterns emerge as a consequence of simple update rules. The key feature of our simulations is validation with respect to distributions known to occur in survey data. We also apply a GIS-aware method for combining the effect of geographical proximity with social characteristics. Our successful simulation confirms our complex systems approach, and also suggests how we can simulate features among different social groups.",

The multidisciplinary nature of the text, its encyclopedic references and citations, its many sources, ancient and modern, explicit and implicit, make the Contradicentia a significant case study for the methodology adopted. Our aims are:   making available online the digital edition of the Contradicentia and its transcription together with other texts related to it  providing a collaborative environment for editing, reading, studying, researching, and posting annotations and comments. An ontology has been designed to tackle the complexity of the Contradicentia, reconstructing Cardano’s ideas in medicine and philosophy of nature, and capturing knowledge about significant contextual information.",

The aim is to enable curators to situate their collection expertise in the realm of facilitating digital scholarship and to provide them with the practical skills to do so. The ambitious two-year initiative will deliver a core set of fifteen bespoke one-day courses twice a year, covering topics such as basics of the web, data visualisation for analysis in scholarly research and the use of linked data, API’s and the semantic web in libraries. This short paper will discuss the programme's design and report on the first quarter’s progress, outcomes, best practices and lessons learned in the hopes this model may be useful for similar institutions.",

Findings from this study suggest that meaning making for both writers and readers of personal digital bibliographies inheres to some degree within the abilities of the bibliographic environment to enact framing devices that clarify the system of relations between items as the primary focus of the text.",

This proposal suggests a place for the semantic web in conventional humanities research by exploring a model for structuring traditional scholarship — based on methodologies in use for the managing and organising of notetaking — that introduces a personal space that can support conventional scholarship activities, but that is sufficiently structured to bridge the gap between the nature of personal scholarship and the formal, public, context of the semantic web.",

LEXUS does not enforce any pre-described schema structure to the user, however it supports the creation of lexicon within the structure of the proposed ISO-LMF standard and promotes the usage of concept names proposed by the ISO data categories. LEXUS has distinct possibilities for visualization. Its support for multimedia allows for local or archived images/movie clips to be attached to different elements of a lexical entry. Its support for customizable views allows for different ways of styling lexicon. Finally LEXUS allows shared access to a given lexicon, suitable for collaboration among researchers as it facilitates concurrent work on a given language by allowing multiple users access to the lexicon. These features make LEXUS a promising online shared-access multimedia encyclopedic lexicon tool for language documentation projects.",

It reports on ongoing investigations into parameter setting and its impact on classification of such texts by author, genre, or form, using Eder & Rybicky's stylometric scripts for R. Based on an investigation into the Corneille-Molière controversy, several methodological issues standing in the way of reliable results have been identified. One issue concerns the degree to which such authorship classification tasks are influenced by genre (here, comedy or tragedy) and form (here, verse or prose). Investigations into this issue show that input parameters have indeed systematic effects on the relative influence of authorship, genre and form in the classification of plays. Being able to take such effects into account may increase the reliability of authorship attribution results.",

IC is intended to frame discussion around peripheral and non-critical system design choices. One place of value for IC is in generating augmented metadata about digital resources. There are two parts to the proposed paper. First, a provisional definition is offered. Examples that fit the definition are considered and used to refine the definition. This allows us to explore the robustness and feasibility of IC, looking at its uses and implications in representing digital objects in virtual spaces. In the second part, this paper shares an example study comparing the participation habits of users in two system features - one which is representative of IC properties and one which is not. This study find difference in user engagement between the two systems.",

Our VisualPage application will enable the large-scale identification and analysis of the graphical elements of digitized printed books, such as margin space, line indentation, and typeface attributes. This application will enable researchers to identify unique or representative examples across very large data sets of digitized texts. Such computational analysis will reveal new ways of thinking about both the printed book and its digitized forms. This paper presents the current development of our proof-of-concept VisualPage software and some findings from the analysis of our initial data set of 300 single-author books of poetry published between 1860-1880.",

In the latter case, this means moving beyond the emulation of traditional methods of scholarship tied to the page (albeit with linking metaphors as in the first generation document-centric WWW), to new ways anchored in the web of Linked Data.",

       "abstract":"“Counting Words with Henry James” undertakes text analysis and topic modelling to demonstrate how the digital humanities participates in the recent turn in literary theory from the “hermeneutics of suspicion” to what Rita Felski calls post-critical or “reflective reading.” I argue that critiques of the digital humanities as being anti- or even non-theoretical fundamentally misrecognize its alliance with such recent theoretical initiatives. Instead, the self-critical methodologies of digital humanities also manifest the “the intricate play of perception, interpretation, and affective orientation” that characterizes critical reading after suspicion. Thus, I ultimately hope to move beyond the unfortunate associations of quantitative literary analysis with “not reading” or data crunching by offering a different theoretical vocabulary for its continuing work in partnership with literary theory. At the same time, I propose that the emerging theoretical program of “reflective reading” can address methodological insufficiencies in how quantitative analysts move from data to interpretation or from signal to concept.",

However, for various good reasons, different teams doing prosopographical work have taken different approaches to the creation of their data. In the same way that CIDOC-CRM has been developed to allow connections between different cultural heritage data collections to be made, an Ontology for Historical Persons would allow prosopographical information from different projects to connect more effectively. In this presentation, I would present our current thoughts on the subject, and start a conversation with other projects with an interest in shared, structured, prosopographical data.",

It takes as case studies three JISC funded projects at University College London (including DHOER: Digital Humanities Open Educational Resources) where each seeks to push the boundaries of open educational practice. To encourage open education requires a change in academic culture, the building of user communities to ensure sustainability, and importantly institutional support. By making our teaching resources openly and freely available to all, we spread our ideas and methodologies to the wider academic and research communities beyond DH. This paper will present the results of these projects, show why these issues are important, particularly to overcome possible skepticism of what we in DH do, and point the way forward to future initiatives and research possibilities.",

       "abstract":"This paper provides a description and analysis of the trajectory of Project Bamboo, a major humanities cyberinfrastructure initiative in the United States. While previous work has addressed the opportunities, consequences and form of humanities cyberinfrastructure, very little has been written about Project Bamboo, and how it does and does not reflect visions put forth for humanities cyberinfrastructure. In addition, there has been little discussion of the precipitous drop in community enthusiasm and even awareness of Bamboo, despite its considerable amount of funding. This paper will elucidate the evolution of Project Bamboo’s goals and scope from its inception to the present, the factors that have contributed to its increasingly negative public perception (including an assessment of which form inherent problems for cyberinfrastructure initiatives vs. avoidable tactical missteps), and how Bamboo is working to overcome those issues as it moves forward.",

       "abstract":"This short paper presents new capabilities of Collective Biographies of Women (CBW), a UVA/IATH project with a database of over 1200 volumes, comprising more than 13,000 biographies of more than 8000 women. We introduce the phrase, “documentary social network,” to refer to prosopographical representations rather than actual social networks; the books published 1830-1940 collect short versions of many persons and types, documenting trends in representation across periods and nations. The paper examines various radial and columnar graphs of \"siblings\" and \"cousins\" (degrees of separation among 1,2, or more books) of famous and obscure women of differing roles. CBW's documentary networks, along with our innovative markup schema, open a field of ramifying versions of female biography defying gender norms; our findings enrich studies in biography, model new approaches to \"personography,\" and display on both micro and macro scales a digital historiography beyond time and period, place and nationality.",

       "abstract":"LEXUS is a flexible web-based lexicon tool tailored for documenting endangered languages but can be used as a lexicographical tool for any other language. LEXUS does not enforce any pre-described schema structure to the user, however it supports the creation of lexicon within the structure of the proposed ISO-LMF standard and promotes the usage of concept names proposed by the ISO data categories. LEXUS has distinct possibilities for visualization. Its support for multimedia allows for local or archived images/movie clips to be attached to different elements of a lexical entry. Its support for customizable views allows for different ways of styling lexicon. Finally LEXUS allows shared access to a given lexicon, suitable for collaboration among researchers as it facilitates concurrent work on a given language by allowing multiple users access to the lexicon. These features make LEXUS a promising online shared-access multimedia encyclopedic lexicon tool for language documentation projects.",

Anthony Papers, and by curators of the the Joseph A. Labadie Collection of radical history. Our experiences building and using Editors' Notes illustrate both the challenges and potential of \"open notebook humanities.\" We report on the design and implementation of the platform, how it has been used so far, and plans for future development.",

This paper examines informal and formal communication channels used by members of the DH community to diffuse information and build communities. We analyze data from these communications to determine how these interactions connect DH community members at the individual, group, and institutional levels and across the DH landscape and helps answer the question: How does the socio-technical ecology connect or partition the landscape of the DH community? This work will apply multi-dimensional network analysis to data from Twitter, LLC and DHQ journals, DH-related NEH grants awards, the TEI-L and Humanist listservs, DH syllabi, and other sources, to paint a wider view of the connections among people, teams, institutions, and communication channels that make up the DH landscape.",

We have run years-long experiment to see how one might build an edition which is scholarly in a traditional sense, but which extends the editorial conversation into multiple pre-existing social media platforms including blogs, wiki discussion pages, dedicated Renaissance and early modern online community spaces, Skype-enabled interviews with our advisory group, and Twitter. The past two years of work suggests that some blend of intensive oversight and engagement with defined communities, along with a receptivity to spontaneously formed communities of affinity is necessary to effectively implement social scholarly production.",

However, there is a need to develop theory and technology for incorporating gestural technologies into expressive digital humanities systems applications. Toward addressing this need, we have developed new interdisciplinary theory and technology for expressive gestural interfaces based on insights from media studies, semiotics, psychology, human-computer interaction. In particular, we produced a platform for building interactive narrative systems that change emotional tone, theme, perspective, and other content elements in response to embodied user input on multi-touch devices. We have also produced scholarship that examines the philosophical implications and impacts of the use of these emerging technologies.",

A key challenge, given any system of descriptors, is that of attribute repeatability among documents of the same category. A descriptor that is marked as existing in a document is likely to exist; However, a descriptor might be unmarked due to an omission or simply because it is not present in the part of the manuscript that is available for inspection. In order to overcome this challenge, we suggest a new statistical tool that allows us to hypothesize which attributes should be turned-on and then perform classification on the augmented data.",

This work has emerged from from integrated research and pedagogy aims that are based upon an integrated sociology and cognitive science framework for classification/categorization and present early results with applications to computer gaming and educational software (with foci upon critique of disempowering social identity constructions). As I develop theory and platforms, those are then used in the classroom resulting in new projects each term that have been accepted into peer-reviewed conferences with students and co-authors.",

This ambitious project is in the process of digitizing around four million handwritten letters dating from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries which are part of the Medici Granducal Archive, 1537-1743. Eventually MAP will publish digital images of these historical documents on BIA, which were formerly accessible only onsite in Florence. Along with each image, BIA will also provide a transcription of each document in its original language, accompanied by an English-language synopsis, which places the document within a historical context. The completion of this vast undertaking has become a real possibility by using crowdsourcing and digital editing techniques.",

       "abstract":"Data modeling is one of the main tasks of digital humanists. They engage in it creating databases, corpora, digital editions, geographical information systems, research collections, digital libraries, project-specific markup and also crosswalks for heterogenous data collections. In light of this variety of activities it is interesting to note that there is no general theory of data modeling in the digital humanities. This paper seeks to ask, in a very preliminary way, what ideas could be part of a first outline of a general theory of data modeling in the humanities.",

All materials should be available independent of any one interface; 5. All materials should be held in a sustainable long-term storage system, such as an institutional repository.

       "abstract":"  The emergence of the Linked Data movement offers music collections with the potential to change how they structure and share their data1. The ability to use Linked Data to combine music metadata with other information sources offers rich semantic possibilities for both access to and promotion of music, and provides considerable scope for music collections to remodel their data in a way which makes a significant contribution to the growing web of data2. Previously, collections have focused on building and maintaining relational database models and have used, where possible, common metadata schemas to help build interoperability into their collections. While this has achieved a degree of interchange of structured data between collections, much of this approach has been limited by the type of data structure, the standards used, and above all the development of customised solutions such as APIs for sharing such data3. The technologies associated with Linked Data hold the promise of enabling music collections to achieve a high level of semantic interchange with other information resources, and examples of such interchange might include the combining of music metadata with geospatial, historical or biographical data4. The advantage of such an approach would allow music archives to focus on their core data collection (i.e. music metadata) and achieve a streamlining of their workflow. The publishing of algorithmic data related to musical form and content as linked data also offers the possibility of developing new applications for music information retrieval5, and allows exciting possibilities for music searching and recommendation. This paper will investigate a number of approaches to the publication of music collections as Linked Open Data. It will explore the motivations for, and benefits of, taking this approach to encoding and exposing musical data. A critical appraisal of the state of the art technology will be outlined and its suitability with relation to music collections discussed. The paper will also explore some of the key changes in maintaining a digital collection and will attempt to address how the notion of a centralised collection has changed as a result of this emerging technology. This impending paradigm shift is one which challenges the notion of data ownership and places organisations and collections in a different position when it comes to managing data. The paper uses the development of a database system for the Contemporary Music Centre (CMC), a national archive and resource centre for Irish composer’s music, to illustrate the design and theoretical processes involved in enabling some of the Linked Data technologies. This database tracks the metadata on Irish composers’ compositions and associated materials and is currently being redesigned as part of a new web site which is under development. In addition to replacing the current structure and underlying technologies which power the database, the project also wishes to futureproof the system for the medium-term and take advantage of the emerging trends in digital collection management. In deciding upon the particular approach to follow to deploy Linked Data in this system, a series of interviews examining the different user groups’ attitudes and views on the linking of CMC’s content to external data was carried out. The feedback received from these interviews, when combined with the in-depth review of the state of the art, was a key input into developing an approach for the CMC’s content. The results of this user-based research also helped to inform the design of a road map of how an approach to Linked Data for a music data source might be taken. The research also illustrates some of the potential problems with the technology and suggests some ways in which these problems might be overcome. The user research reveals a number of notable findings in relation to attitudes towards the linking of external data to music information. While many identify with the idea of a distributed music collection, users are cautious about exposing and linking music-related data and content to external non-musicrelated content. Key among users is the need for such a Linked Data-driven system to ensure accuracy of data and maintain the trust of its users. There was also a strong view that such external links needed to be curated by both CMC and the users, and that the Linked Data provided should balance with and enhance the core collection data rather than overshadow it. The solution proposed as a result of this user research involves the restructuring and mapping of CMC’s database to Music Ontology classes and concepts and presents a number of approaches involving the presentation of the remodelled data.

Specifically, we will attach personal name data provided by authoritative personal name information to the iconographic parts of people featured in old photographs. Then, for these photos, we will interpret that “the higher level of frequency with which certain members appear together in group photographs, the stronger the interrelationship between the members”, and will analyze the network relationship of the ties between each member. We will then compare the data by decade and generation, thereby clarifying the transitions in personal networks between family members.",

In this scenario, new software tools are required that could integrate in the Web environment, i.e. where data is available, and support users in their basic activities — the so-called scholarly primitives — such as annotation, augmentation and contextualization. Finally, the result of these activities that constitutes itself valuable knowledge, should be externalized, i.e. made available not only other researchers and to entire mankind. This paper briefly introduces Pundit: a novel Web-based annotation tool that allows scholars to augment Web page contents with semantically structured data. In this way, user-created knowledge can not only be easily made available to other researches, enabling collaboration, but also further recombined with other data in external applications and used beyond the context they originated from.",

Therefore, the present study explores a method of displaying textual information of experiences and detecting narratives to learn lessons. We conducted two visualizations of database on the Great earthquakes and considered the outcome of each. We found that the outcome of one of the visualization was gaining factual information on phenomena, whereas the other that was designed to have future perspectives allowed to find the demands or views for the future as well as the facts in the past. If taking the perspective for extracting narratives and learning lessons, the outcome having future views is more contributing to gaining meaningful story. The future-oriented perspective would be recommended to add into the process of designing archive to learn lessons on natural disaster.",

Toward that end, I discuss the affinities between digital textual studies and SI. I present a case study of an early project in the history of humanities computing, Bessinger and Smith’s A Concordance to the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, as a demonstration of the joint analytical power of textual studies and SI. The team formed various alliances with colleagues, vendors, publishers, and others during their project. Their collaboration cannot be explained without discussing such alliances, specifically the ways in which the ICTs used and made by the collaborators shaped and were shaped by disciplinary cultures and institutional contexts. Furthermore, by paying attention to the concordances linguistic and bibliographic codes, we can see evidence of a program of extreme automatization at work in their production.",

Our study focuses on paratexts that resemble a citation, i.e., those paratexts that explicitly reference one or more bibliographic elements, such as author, title, date, or quotation. We find such references in the paratexual elements such as titles, subtitles, epigraphs, dedications, and authorial notes. Our analysis of these referential paratexts will provide different views of these poets as seen through their paratexts and the diverse collection of authors, artists, and works referenced by those paratexts. We will present the findings from a thorough analysis of paratextual reference in Swinburne, Rossetti, and Tennyson, and based on those findings, we will make some preliminary observations about Swinburnian and Victorian paratextual poetics.",

We begin by presenting an overview of bibliometric analysis, noting several barriers to applying this method in the humanities. Following that, we present a novel online tool for extracting and classifying citations in the humanities. This tool uses both document layout recognition and natural language processing techniques to classify citations in three ways: frequency, location-in-document, and polarity (each described below). We compare these results with previous studies of humanities citations, as well as our own qualitative analysis of the documents, and explore further directions for this tool.",

Our case study is SAWS (Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project). SAWS produces TEI editions with semantic annotations in RDF to investigate links as Linked Data. This has the potential to be used widely to link and describe related texts. Links can be extracted and transformed for manipulation and searching using alternative methods, illustrated by our TEI-to-RDF XSLT. The TEI-editing process may present barriers for non-technical users. Islandora repository management software helps create and manage documents through intuitive, GUI-driven interactions with Fedora repositories. Within Islandora, the Digital Humanities Solution Pack provides a WYSIWIG interface to create, edit and annotate TEI documents. We demonstrate how TEI can be developed using Linked Data and RDF, and how Linked-Data-enhanced TEI documents can be facilitated using the DH Solution Pack.",

The metadata-based OpenEmblem Portal prototype was built to provide access to these digital contents and demonstrate the feasibility of international repository interoperability. Experimentation has begun to leverage Linked Open Data services to facilitate discovery and use of digitized emblem resources. This paper reports on progress to date and describes next steps in leveraging Linked Open Data to improve the utility of the OpenEmblem Portal for research and pedagogy.

The testbed for the research is the HathiTrust Digital Library, an international repository collaborative that is preserving and providing access to the output of large-scale book digitization projects, including those by Google, the Internet Archive, and a host of localized digitization programs. This paper is an explicit effort to foster a conversation on the impact of digital imaging at scale on humanities scholarship by marshaling empirical research data related to digitization error to characterize the strengths and limitations of digital surrogacy. The findings on page-image and volume-level error provide a foundation for assessing the impact of massive collections of digital book surrogates on the readability and hence the usefulness of digitized books in an online environment.",

In our research, we are attempting to challenge the already established notions about how poetry is visualized. For this purpose, we are building Ambiances: an interactive framework to write and visualize poetry. The main goal of our framework is to create a tool that makes a symbiotic relationship between writing and visualizing a poem. The contribution of our research is to explore the advantages, issues and challenges that a framework for writing and visualizing poetry interactively and can provide. Additionally, we will also address the multiple authorship issues and the implications that will surface from the use of our framework. In the end, our research aims to implement, analyze and study new interactive methods for creating and visualizing poetry.",

As part of the _Knowledge Management_ process, _Knowledge Socialization_ is a critical step during which the community experiences a decisive interchange of ideas. In this work, we present *a new model for _Knowledge Management_* based on the classic Nonaka and Takeuchi's one but adapted to the Web 2.0 by using wiki technologies to support _Knowledge Socialization_, and we propose *to apply this model to the case of _elBulli_*. _elBulli_, voted by _Restaurant_ magazine as the best restaurant in the world for five years, has now become a foundation for creativity and innovation in high cuisine. It incorporates disciplines such as technology, science, and the arts in its research, and it publishes its results in conferences, books or journal articles. Therefore, elBulli is an appropriate case to apply a _Knowledge Management_ model that makes maximum use of its knowledge.",

The tool provides aerial views of the collection’s structure and features rendered from metadata extracted, classified, and aggregated at different directory levels and presented as a treemap. Features such as data classes, directory and file names, dates and checksums can be analyzed to study the collection’s formation processes and establish priorities for archiving. While analysis of formation processes, viewed from a variety of scales and perspectives, is especially intuitive for archaeologists, these tools have wide application for any data collection both active and archived. Preliminary results and ongoing work as well as the wider implications for organizing humanities data are discussed.",

Using the metadata provided in the preliminaries sections of these texts, we have constructed a series of graph databases that allow us to organize this information in a custom tailored and meaningful way. The data is exported to Gephi graph visualization software for analysis to discover patterns, key communities, and structures not apparent in traditional humanistic studies. We then use traditional humanistic techniques to study important points located in the graph. This study demonstrates the utility of social network analysis in understanding Early Modern publication in the Spanish Empire. By using modern tools to analyze large data sets, we show the effectiveness of digital humanities as a tool to locate previously overlooked areas for further study using a more traditional humanistic approach.",

       "abstract":"Our project seeks to uncover formal and semantic artifacts of poetic tropes within eighteenth-century literature. It is our contention that the specific, trope-based genres of eighteenth-century poetic satire and allegory operate within the mediation of specific semantic fields by the formal constraints of poetic diction. Using a multi-pronged approach, that combines frequency analysis and topic modeling with an automated recognition of poetic form (including meter and rhyme scheme), we seek to test our ability to computationally identify figurative language at the level of genre within a corpus of eighteenth-century poems (~1500). This project not only expands our definition of the \"context\" that is necessary to identify satiric or allegoric writing (replacing knowledge of specific socio-cultural phenomenon with knowledge of form) but also serves as a pilot study into the possibility of automating the recognition of figurative language and thereby opening the field of poetry for analysis by the Digital Humanities.",

In this study, we use the database with 578,617 words $2 as being processed for morphological analysis to all sentences of Saikaku's 24 works on the basis of \"Shinpen Saikaku Zenshu\". This database was developed in cooperation with the editor of \"Yorozu no fumihougu \" at the affiliate laboratory. The database is the only database to be able to analyze Saikaku's works at present and has a high degree of reliability from a viewpoint of Japanese language and literature. The analysis uses an appearance ratio of word class as a basic data.",

A new generation of textometric open-source software called TXM is currently developped since 2007. This article presents the design of the import environment being developed to allow the platform to analyze various kind of TEI encoded sources. The TXM platform “translates” the TEI source document structure into the terms relevant for textometric analysis: “text units”, “text metadata”, “lexical units”, “word properties”, “text divisions”, primary and secondary “text surface”, “out-of-text”, “pagination”, etc. We will describe how that approach has been validated on a comprehensive set of completely unrelated TEI encoded corpora: “Bibliothèques Virtuelles Humanistes” corpus (16th century books), Flaubert’s “Bouvard et Pécuchet” 19th century novel, corpus of the “DISCOURS” linguistic journal and the TEI version of the Brown 1 million words corpus from the NLTK project.",

In this paper, I explore computational techniques for studying phonological parallelism in a single, sizable corpus of Biblical Hebrew poetry, namely the Book of Psalms. A technique for evaluating whether a given poem or section thereof contains a statistically anomalous clustering of a consonantal phoneme or group of consonantal phonemes is presented. This technique can be used to evaluate the legitimacy of a proposal concerning the artistic use of sound identified by a critical eye/ear, and it also forms the basis of software designed to analyze the entire corpus and present passages for the researcher to consider as possible examples of the artistic use of sound.",

Co-occurrences are considered as relations between characters appearing in theses memories under certain constraints. Then a network is generated, and social network analysis tools are applied. We present different methods to construct the network of co-occurrences, and describe features of this social network as degree and cluster distributions, small-world property and negative assortativity. We also observe a separation into two clusters due to the writing of the book in two times, with an important number of characters appearing in both volumes. Methods to determine a minimum number of co-occurrences to generate social networks close to the situation that occurred at the time (18th century) are also proposed and studied. Finally, we discuss the opportunity to consider this object as a realist social network of its era.",

As an integrated hybrid edition, it will provide scholars with an up-to-date, philologically dependable textual basis.

Based upon a unified data model, it will support all editorial steps from entering the meta data through transcribing the textual witnesses to preparing the online and print publication. This paper shall outline the philological challenges of the project and show how the projected platform is to meet them.",

       "abstract":"Bowker and Star (1999) warn of the shaping force of classification systems, of the power of their apparent naturalization as part of infrastructures and the consequences thereof. The rise of the semantic web and its grounding in the use of ontologies threatens to explode the scale of this issue. This paper explores the practical implications and theoretical limits of using ontologies, offering a survey of best practices and ongoing areas of active research. The survey shows that the process of ontology construction and integration in the semantic web does have the potential to restrict human thought. It is then argued that certain features of the semantic web make it possible to avoid this detrimental outcome but only if a critical mass of people---the community of humanists might be enough---actively use these features to keep the web a place of flexible ontologies and humane classification.",

The primary motivation for the creation of SDFB is to make possible a new way to reconstruct, represent, and study the complex relations between authors, texts, publishers, and readers in the early modern period. It combines computational and statistical methods, which can explore the relationships of thousands of historical figures using hundreds of thousands of source documents, with the local expertise of a growing number of humanities scholars.",

       "abstract":"Over the past decade humanities scholars have begun to seriously explore the potential of using 3D modeling software to reconstruct historic spaces and architecture. However, because of technological and design limitations, their works have tended either to feature visually rich environments that were closed and static, or more interactive and data driven spatial projects that failed to seize upon the potential of realistic 3D imaging. But now as 3D gaming engines are making it easier to display visually sophisticated virtual environments in browser windows in real-time, and to access and interface with large data sets, new possibilities exist for 3D reconstructions. Using both demos of historical reconstructions running live in the Unity 3D engine and mockups of future plug-ins, my presentation will present a model for the future of 3D historical reconstructions that bring a variety of data together, arguing for projects that are persistent, historical, collaborative, and curated.",

       "abstract":"The Book of Hours is perhaps the most ubiquitous type of surviving medieval manuscripts. Each unique book contains a wealth of information about liturgical practices, social and private use of books, manuscript production and decoration, and personal and local choices for the creation of private devotional collections. Each Book of Hours contains a Kalendar that lists feast days for the entire year. These document the standard days for liturgical celebration, but are filled with local and temporal variants that paint a picture of the ways in which practices change according to regional interests over the centuries. This paper describes the design and implementation of a comparative Kalendar built from distributed resources served from multiple participating tools and repositories.",

The main results regard the difficulties to involve non specialist in using targeted cultural heritage collections, which are likely due to a marginal interest towards the collection content. On the other hand, users showed a higher interest towards the research activities carried out on the digital content, including all the research process (sources, measurements, analyses). Thus we propose a shift in the focus of systems for managing cultural heritage digital collections: from tools for disseminating cultural content to tools for involving general users in goals, methods and results of scientific research on the cultural content.",

       "abstract":"   Summary The ChartEx (Charter Excavator) Project is developing and evaluating an innovative collection of computational methods to assist researchers in searching, extracting, analyzing, linking and understanding the content of medieval charters. The project is using both natural language processing and data mining techniques to establish entities such as locations (location in this context refers to a specific building or piece of land) and actors, events and dates related to those locations. The project is also developing a “virtual workbench” to support historians in working with large corpora of digital charters and the vast amounts of information that can now be extracted from them. These methods could subsequently be applied to other corpora of digitized texts, be they historical or contemporary.   The ChartEx Project Researchers now have access to a deluge of data in the form of digitized historical records.  One example is medieval charters or title deeds which record transfers of land ownership and are a major source for the study of people and places in the past, including the topography, economy and social relationships of pre-modern communities. However, current digital search aids are not sufficiently sensitive to the needs of researchers seeking to exploit the wealth of detail available within this type of record. The ChartEx (Charter Excavator) Project is developing and evaluating an innovative collection of computational methods to assist researchers in searching, extracting, analyzing, linking and understanding the content of medieval charters. These methods could subsequently be applied to other corpora of digitized texts, be they historical or contemporary. The ChartEx Project is extracting information from charters, using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and data mining (DM) components to establish entities such as locations (location in this context refers to a specific building or piece of land) and actors, events and dates related to those locations. The NLP component uses rules derived from the knowledge of experienced researchers, in combination with the semantic meaning of the written language of the charters, to extract these entities.  In order to inform these rules a new markup schema was defined for use in the project.  From a sample of manually marked up charters, the NLP component generates automatic markup of entities in a larger corpus of charters. The DM component then uses the output of the NLP component, as refined by researchers if needed, to extract relationships between entities.   However, the rules used by the NLP component and the relationships found by the DM component cannot reflect all the knowledge of experienced researchers. Therefore, the third crucial component of the ChartEx Project is the use of novel instrumental interaction techniques which will allow researchers to both refine the processing of the NLP and DM, and to directly manipulate (visualise, confirm, correct, refine, augment) relationships extracted from the charters to gain new insights of interest about the entities within them. Instrumental interaction emphasizes that both the computational system and human users have knowledge and must work together to achieve the users’ goals. ChartEx is developing a highly usable “virtual workbench” for researchers to support this instrumental interaction. The ChartEx Workbench has interactive visualizations of large amounts of data and a range of tools to manipulate data and their relationships. The ChartEx project is demonstrating its approach by analysing five corpora of charters from the 10th to 16th centuries originating from both the UK and other European countries. Two corpora contain full Latin texts and three contain Latin texts that have been provided with English summaries within digital archival catalogues. The collections derive from The National Archives of the United Kingdom, the Borthwick Institute for Archives in York (United Kingdom), the deeds collected as part of the DEEDS project at the University of Toronto (Canada), and deeds originating from the archive at Cluny (France). Charters are an abundant and fundamental source for the study of many aspects of medieval societies.  While recent scholarship has expanded the range of charter studies to such fields as the history of emotions and performativity, their core usefulness remains their provision of basic data: personal names, place names, and dates. In particular, they help us to trace the ownership and occupation of houses and parcels of land over centuries, providing the basis for many further studies from history to tourism and conservation. Initially in the project we assumed that the formulaic nature of the language in medieval charters would make the NLP quite straightforward.  However, the high level formulaic nature of expressions revealed considerable variability when subjected to fine-grained analysis.  Nonetheless, by developing a detailed markup schema for the initial hand coding of a set of charters, it was possible to train the NLP component to identify personal names, place names and locations. The Latin (and after c.1300, vernacular) phrases that describe, for example, the location of a property (e.g., ‘the tenement in Petergate lying between the tenement once held by John the apothecary and now held by Richard of Huntington on one side, and the church of St Michael on the other’), were the pre-cursors to street-numbers and scientific spatial referencing developed from the 19th century.  When researching a particular historical lived environment, the researcher needs to establish links between actors, events, and locations, by recovering and reconstructing the relationships between hundreds, even thousands, of data points, included in different charters and even in different archives. Most current systems for searching digital charters depend on manual markup systems which identify entities such as place-names and personal-names in the text and include such entities in catalogue metadata. One example of such a project would be ‘Paradox of Medieval Scotland’ which uses metadata in just this way and then provides full text transcriptions of the locational data within the charter. Another example is the WARD 2 data in The National Archives. ChartEx is using NLP to go beyond the metadata and to explore the actual content of charters, thus enabling researchers to explore the discursive descriptions of locations, actors and events within those locations.  The ChartEx Project has designed a detailed markup scheme that adequately represents the ways in which historians currently read charters and extract spatial means from them. This new markup schema was created through a collaborative process involving researchers from 3 different institutions.  This schema includes a set of entities and relationships that are at a level of abstraction above traditional diplomatic markup and specifically identifies actors, locations and events in a way that can be used by the NLP component.  This new markup schema is documented in a detailed set of guidelines that have been used annotate a set of 250 charters from across the five different data archival data sets.  These manually marked up charters provide act as a set training data for the technical components of the project. The ChartEx Project has also developed the ChartEx Virtual Workbench to allow historians to work with the large amounts of data becoming available to them. For this we haven taken a highly user-centric approach, using the latest methodologies from human-computer interaction. Eight historians participated in contextual interviews, in which they described in considerable detail how they work with charters on a range of different historic problems and recreated actual pieces of research they had undertaken with charters.  These sessions were recorded and analysed in detail to understand the specific tasks that historians are undertaking with charters and how to support them most effectively in doing the same tasks in a purely digital environment, as well as provide them with new functionality that they have not had before.  In particular, we also considered the additional information that historians will have available from the results of the NLP and DM components in the project.  On the basis of all this information, a number of “low fidelity” prototypes of possible workbench configurations and functionalities have been developed and two co-design workshops have been held with the six historians and two archivist advisors to the to discuss the different possibilities.  As a result of these workshops, a more detailed prototype has been developed and is being evaluated by the original set of historians and archivists and a number of newly recruited historians and archivists, who are testing it with realistic research tasks. This will undoubtedly lead to a further iteration of refinement of the Virtual Workbench before the final prototype is developed by the end of the ChartEx Project. The ChartEx Project is funded under the Digging into Data challenge (www.diggingintodata.org). The research consortium includes, historians and linguists as well as experts in human computer interaction, natural language processing and data mining from six institutions in four countries: Universities of York and Brighton (United Kingdom), University of Toronto (Canada), University of Washington and Columbia University (USA) and University of Leiden (Netherlands).

The MVP’s primary mission is to enable new critical insights that are difficult without digital or computational approaches. We begin by understanding “versioning” as the process through which scholars examine multiple “witnesses” of a text in order to gain critical insight into its creation and transmission. Moreover, we need to compare both textual and conceptual variants identified by editors. Before building its own tool, the MVP surveyed and assessed an array of existing tools, including the following: Juxta, oXygen, CollateX, nMerge, Git, TEI-Comparator, DiffDog, ExamDiff, XMLStarlet, Versioning Machine, XMLUnit, and XOM. This paper presents the methodologies of the survey and assessment, the MVP’s findings, and the conclusions it has drawn.",

The paper does so by offering focused case studies of two specific data visualization environments: IBM’s Many Eyes platform and Alan Liu’s NEH-funded Research-oriented Social Environment. It examines the corporate lineage of Many Eyes, while constructing a parallel genealogy for RoSE, one rooted more in scholarship, new media art practice, and collaborative knowledge production. The goal is not to critique the corporate affiliation of Many Eyes as such, but to ask what might be at stake in the implementation of a technology that has its ideological roots and disciplinary methodologies outside of the humanities.",

However social scientists and, more obviously, humanist scholars have questions concerning human experience of space and space-time. In recent years, GIScience has increasingly been adding methods more directly supporting qualitative analysis. I present an example from my own work integrating remote sensing imagery with demographic variables to create a measure of \"nature-ness\" —the human sense of being in a natural place, as a step towards explaining the enormous variation of the experience of nature within and across US cities.",

       "abstract":"  Scholars have often maintained a critical distance between their own forms of knowledge making and those of fans, a distance that we find worth interrogating in the setting of digital humanities. After all, the kind of mapping and charting of vast amounts of cultural data that digital humanists are beginning to do seems closely tied to fan practices of collective textual analysis (and production). We argue against a general academic hesitation to seriously incorporate or interrogate fannish intellectual production as compatible with academic work, and we see digital humanities as a promising site for cooperation between fans and academics. Indeed, digital humanities appear indebted to the intellectual productions of fan communities in an age of media convergence.  Specifically, this paper engages with fan material in a way that acknowledges how it may inform and work alongside academic work in television studies. Fan communities’ collective work analyzing and producing digital work around television shows, including mapping characters and their affective relationships, has heavily influenced our own television analysis method, which involves graphing and analyzing social networks of television characters. This method also draws on the academic work of Franco Moretti and other digital humanities scholars who have demonstrated the usefulness of social network analysis of various texts, but who have not discussed the relationships between their analysis and that of fans. We use digital graphing tools to investigate affective relationships, as defined primarily by fans, between television characters across lines of racial or sexual “difference” in ensemble character-driven dramas. Our data sets have in some cases been gleaned from fan forums, from which we have constructed affective social network graphs using tools like Gephi, ManyEyes, and Mathematica. Analysis of these graphs, we found, illuminates trends and “underlying structures” that might otherwise be difficult to notice (Moretti). To explore the usefulness of graphing social networks, we demonstrated the absence of queer characters and relationships in the television series Lost, a show with a sizable multi-ethnic cast that draws heavily on the sexual, affective, and familial tension of its characters for dramatic effect. First establishing the overwhelming preponderance of heterosexual pairings, we reorganized the nodes so that the most frequently appearing characters gravitate towards the center of the field, and the less frequently appearing characters radiate outwards.  As we might expect, characters who appear most frequently have multiple lines of (heterosexual) relationships, while less frequently appearing characters are likelier to be unattached or to have only one relationship over the course of the series.  The suggestion of an undergirding heterosexual matrix, visible here, is borne out in the conclusion of the show. In a \"flash-sideways,\" the storyline in a parallel timeline where Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 never crashes, characters recall the moments on the island when they make contact with their principal love interests. This forces a heteronormative pairing as an organizing force (possibly queering the pair of John Locke and Ben Linus, who recall their past lives but without the benefit of a significant other). The graph also makes legible the outliers, exceptions, and outsiders that relate to the frequently appearing characters in ways that support the structuring heterosexual matrix (See Figure 1). One interesting cluster that the graph brings to our attention, for instance, is the set of characters who are positioned as paternal figures to specific nodes.    Fig. 1: Affective and Parental Relations in Lost (Nodal size indicates relative frequency of character’s appearance). Constructed using Gephi.  The lines of paternity as a special category that our graphing highlights, and the general heteronormative drift of the show, also invites us to consider the separateness of maternity as a category with a unique valence. Apart from the running theme of pregnancy dramatized by repeated attempts to capture or rescue the visibly pregnant character, maternity we uncover is an organizing type distinct from paternity. While the characters Kate and Jack both co-parent a child, only Kate’s status as a mother symbolically revokes her candidacy as protector of the island in the finale. Along similar lines, social network graphs of Friday Night Lights reveal the extent of the characters’ racial segregation in the early seasons.1  We chose this show to analyze because race is a central theme as characters negotiate racial tensions in a small Texas town. In the case of Friday Night Lights, segregation is apparent through conventional modes of analysis, but a graph makes it more starkly visible. This graph of a Friday Night Lights episode, for example, shows a notable degree of segregation between black and white characters. The mix of such characters on the television screen hides the fact that there are very few interracial conversations, which this graph depicting all interactions in the episode maps clearly. Here we see that the majority of white characters are only connected to other white characters, and, importantly, that the white characters tend to be more strongly socially connected than black characters—they are given more social power (See Figure 2). This graph then provides in one image a sense of how racial interaction plays out across a whole episode.    Fig. 2: Interactions in Friday Night Lights Season 2 Episode 8. Constructed using ManyEyes.  One way we have used social network graphs to heighten visibility of character segregation (or commonality) is through “deformance,” a playful textual reimagining that in some ways resembles remix culture. Deformance is described by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann in reference to poetry analysis, as a kind of “reading backwards,” a reconsideration of a text by undoing it, upsetting its order, revealing its gaps (30). In the context of this project, deforming graphs has entailed removing certain networked nodes—and thus removing certain characters from the plot—to see what new connections come to the fore, as well as to reveal the role of those removed nodes in the networked system. If a network falls apart when one node is removed, that often speaks more to the significance of that character than does looking at the graph before he or she is removed from the network. In our analysis of Friday Night Lights, for instance, deforming social networks created from fan-generated relationship information (or from our own fannish data generation) revealed that interactions across race hinged on just one or two key characters. Deforming the episode graph above, for example, by removing the central black character Smash and all those characters who interact exclusively with him, revealed the extent to which he functioned as a “bridge” node connecting two otherwise largely distinct communities of characters (See Figure 3).   Fig. 3: Interactions in Friday Night Lights Season 2 Episode 8, with Smash and characters who speak only to him removed. Constructed using ManyEyes. As this work demonstrates, we are not interested in fan labor solely as sources for data, but also as rich and challenging sites for methodological exchanges. The intellectual production of fans has been acknowledged and celebrated; indeed Henry Jenkins’s now-classic text on fan cultures, Textual Poachers, highlights the intelligence of audiences and the seriousness of their responses, which engage in familiar practices of literary criticism. Yet to Jenkins, while fans do work that is critical and interpretive, their criticism “is playful, speculative, subjective” and directed to the fan community (284). We see our methodology as a gesture toward the possibility of digital humanities to engage this playful approach seriously, and to consider the importance of the relationships between fans and other interpretive communities.  With academics and fans less strictly monitoring their boundaries in this era of convergence, and with scholars using digital techniques that may formerly have been dismissed as too “playful” or not seriously analytical, a reconsideration of the fan/scholar relationship and possibilities of exchange (or poaching) is called for. Visualization and mapping are widely circulated by fans broaching similar themes to those we explored. In toggling between an episodic mode of analysis and a mode that exceeds the episode, we rely on the community and labor of fans, appropriating their knowledge as the basis of our inquiry. What this suggests is that the digital humanities can anticipate not just a new kind of appreciation of the fan but an acknowledgement of the rich, intellectually productive, and rigorous strategies of knowledge making that new scholarship exploits in its interpenetrative incursions into the terrain of fandom.

       "abstract":"This paper will review the structure and development philosophy of Heurist, a database abstraction which hides the complexity of richly structured databases from the end-user, allowing them to build complex databases without programmer assistance. It will address the opposition between serendipitous development by scholar-programmers and structured development by software engineers, using two mobile applications developed within Heurist as case studies. I argue that serendipitous development is important at both levels — in the development of databases as in the development of the software. The paper aims to stimulate debate on software development methodologies and the role of the scholar-programmer.",

Users can explore historic events by geo-location, time, venues, people, organizations and theme related media. Also they would be able to leave their own memories using text, audio, photos and even video in order to leave messages to future generations.
