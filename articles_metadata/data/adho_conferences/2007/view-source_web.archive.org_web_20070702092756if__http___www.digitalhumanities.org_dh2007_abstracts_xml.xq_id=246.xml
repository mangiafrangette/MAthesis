                    to work with visualizations that rely on XML data at different levels of
                    granularity. For these visualizations, we propose using a single interface that
                    draws on the underlying structural information at both the collection level and
                    the level of the contents of the individual documents. We compare two models of
                    this kind of interactivity that are the subjects of our current interface design
                    and prototyping activities. One of these systems is predicated on displays
                    relying on sequence, and the other on visualizing the structure of items and
                    facilitating their traversal.</p></div0><div0><head>Discussion</head><p>The common goal of these interface systems is to provide researchers with
                    experimental means of combining overviews of a document with tools for
                    manipulating the display. First is our multilevel document visualization system
                    (Ruecker et al. 2005) that combines three or more simultaneous displays,
                    including a microtext column showing collection items, a separate microtext
                    column showing the contents of a particular document, and a reading view of the
                    document. These different levels of display are combined with tools for
                    selecting and manipulating a portion of the text in a subsequent display.</p><p>The purpose of the multilevel system is to allow the user to work with a digital
                    document within the visual context of related material. We have currently
                    installed it as a feature in the prototype for watching digital scripts, where
                    the standard reading view is supplemented with a digital stage that allows the
                    reader to see both the dynamic text playback and the blocking of the characters
                    as they move around the stage. We are currently carrying out a user study of
                    actors using the system to learn their lines.</p><p>In addition to the dynamic text, we have recently begun to consider the
                    possibilities of using the microtext columns as opportunities for providing
                    overviews that can provide further data. For example, they might be colour-coded
                    and re-organized according to some useful principle. In the Watching the Script
                    demo, one form of colour-coding currently available – for plays that have been
                    encoded in XML that marks the character names – is to help the reader
                    differentiate between characters.</p><p>For purposes of a director planning the play, this overview allows exploration of
                    the various relationships of the characters on the stage. It can be use to
                    address questions such as who is on stage when, and with who, and how many lines
                    does each actor have? By selectively applying colour only to the character or
                    characters of interest, and having the remainder display in regular black text,
                    the director has a tool for studying the entire play from the perspective of the
                    staging.</p><p>Another overview panel in the prototype provides a list of the characters. As a
                    simple display it does not provide many affordances, but with the addition of
                    some further information and the ability to sort, this list also has potential
                    benefits. For example, if we give the user the opportunity of adding next to
                    each character the number of lines that character speaks, or a total of time
                    spent on stage, or both, and then rearranging the characters according to those
                    numbers, we have another tool for use in understanding the play at an overview
                    level, and for planning production. Combined with the blocking tool, these
                    overviews and their related tools begin to create a tool suite that we hope will
                    prove useful to actors, directors, and students of theatre.</p><p>The second prototype produces what we are calling a Document Blueprint: a compact
                    visual representation of the markup in a document. This blueprint can be used to
                    suggest encoding particularities of a document by colour-coding tags and
                    attributes in flexible ways. The identity – and therefore colour-coding – of
                    sections can be defined in ways that ignore certain nodes in an XML tree,
                    including elements, attributes, and text.</p><p>Our first application of this system is to generate a document view where the
                    table of contents is initially displayed in a legible font size and the markup
                    of sections are displayed in small, blueprint mode (where visual cues from the
                    text emerge but the text itself is too small to be legible). The Document
                    Blueprint system allows the user to define which elements to toggle between
                    legible and blueprinting modes. Depending on which elements the user chooses,
                    the system provides a variety of overviews that can help both in understanding
                    and navigating the document, much as the conventional table of contents has
                    always done, but with the important differences of dynamic display and
                    interactivity (Ruecker 2005).</p></div0><div0><head>Future Directions</head><p>For the multilevel display, we are currently working to extend the affordances of
                    the various overview items. It may be useful, for instance, to allow the entire
                    surface to be temporarily subsumed by the overview that currently only occupies
                    one column. The more complex display would show the data, still not at a reading
                    view, but at a smaller level of granularity. Colour-coding and reorganizing this
                    form of display could prove both interesting and useful.</p><p>The document blueprinting project is the youngest of our prototype projects and
                    will likely evolve the most in the coming year. We are developing this system in
                    collaboration with the Orlando Project, which in its next phase will be
                    producing literary critical material in volume form. The dynamic table of
                    contents in this case will be used as a navigation aide for readers interested
                    in browsing through the extended prose of the three volumes. As has been the
                    case with each of the prototypes, we will pursue an iterative cycle of design,
                    prototyping, and development, with user study and experiment at each stage of
                    the cycle.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Ruecker, Stan">Stan Ruecker</name></author><title level="a">The Electronic Book Table of Contents as a Research
