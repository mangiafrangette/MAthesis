                        as a set of critical practices—there will be an increasing desire to measure
                        milestones, achievements, completion, and closure. While one instinct might
                        be to bristle at such tendencies, and the traditional print-based
                        scholarship they seem to imply or infer, being pushed to formulate a more
                        fully realized set of responses can be a healthy exercise for a rapidly
                        expanding field. “Done,” as a shorthand convention that has quickly become
                        ubiquitous in the culture of professional knowledge work, is emblematic in
                        this regard, on the one hand unequivocal and absolute, on the other hand
                        useful only in the context of low-level tasks that accumulate, often without
                        finite bounds or comprehensive structure, in the service of some larger,
                        less-defined endeavor. A server-side PHP upgrade may be “done,” but what
                        about the thematic research collection it exists to support?</p><p>So how do we decide when we’re done? What does it mean to finish something?
                        How does the “open ended nature of the medium” (a phrase we all pay lip
                        service to) jibe with the reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables?
                        What can we learn from finished projects, both successful and unsuccessful?
                        For that matter, how do we define success and failure? Are “we” the ones who
                        ought to be defining it? If not, who? This panel attempts to begin
                        formulating responses to such questions, by bringing together practitioners
                        and project leaders from multiple institutional settings and contexts.
                        William A. Kretzschmar’s paper traces the local history of one particular
                        project, grafting milestones and markers of what its gotten “done” to
                        various versions and releases, a common enough convention in software and
                        information and technology. His remarks raise issues not only for how one
                        assesses closure, but also digital preservation and version control. David
                        Sewell addresses the questions I’ve posed from the perspective of a
                        publisher. His work at the University of Virginia Press’s Rotunda digital
                        imprint, itself unique in the field, offers a very different context, one
                        where finding some measure of “done” is a financial and professional
                        necessity. Finally, the team from the Orlando project offers the
                        perspectives of one of the largest and longest running undertakings in the
                        digital humanities, at the moment when the project has gone to press. The
                        co-authors discuss not only what is done, but also what will stay done (and
                        relevant) only by virtue of the ongoing expenditure of effort and resources,
                        in the form of continual upgrades.</p></div1><div1><head>Large-Scale Humanities Computing Projects: Snakes Chasing Tails, or Every
                        End is a New Beginning?</head><p rend="Presenter">William A. Kretzschmar, Jr.</p><p>One of the motivating questions for this session is “What does it mean to
                        finish something?” As it happens, the word “finish” can mean two things that
                        have quite different implications for large-scale humanities computing
                        projects. On one hand, according to the OED (sv) “finish” can mean ‘To bring
                        to completion; to make or perform completely; to complete.’ On the other
                        hand, the word can also mean ‘To perfect finally or in detail; to put the
                        final and completing touches to (a thing).’ In my own work of this kind, the
                        American Linguistic Atlas project (<xptr to="http://www.lap.uga.edu" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), we do neither of these things. We cannot
                        come to an end of the work because we are witnesses and archivists of how
                        Americans talk, and they keep talking differently across time and space.
                        Neither do we think that our humanities-computing representation of our
                        research is capable of being finally perfected, of achieving some perfect
                        state, because the demands placed upon our research keep changing. If we
                        view the entirety of the Linguistic Atlas Project as a “large-scale
                        humanities computing project,” the word “finish” is just not part of the
                        deal. However, it is quite reasonable to ask, as our granting agencies must
                        ask, “what do you want money for this time?” or “did you accomplish what we
                        gave you money to do?” From this viewpoint, the Atlas Project consists of a
                        series of particular tasks or experiments, each one of which is capable of
                        being “finished” in both senses of the word. In this paper, I would like to
                        discuss the reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate
                        to the sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. In so doing,
                        I hope to show the special character of work done deliberately as part of a
                        sequence for a large-scale project, as opposed to work proposed as a
                        singular task. The contextualization of the separate tasks leads to special
                        cases of what it means to “finish” the work in either sense. The point of
                        what follows is not the Atlas Project itself, but instead the way that
                        individual tasks respond to the technical and academic situation at the
                        time, and how our work and thinking over the years must change so that we
                        can avoid the charge of being the snake that chases its own tail.</p><p>The Linguistic Atlas Project Web site has been notable over many years for
                        its twin goals of interactivity for research (including the use of GIS) and
                        making its data sets accessible and available to the public. I first
                        programmed a GIS system on the Mac platform for our Linguistic Atlas data in
                        1990 (Kirk and Kretzschmar 1991, 1992; Kretzschmar 1992). It was widely used
                        for teaching and research on American English in the early 1990s, and it
                        immediately led to breakthroughs in how we were able to think about language
                        variation data (Kretzschmar 1994, 1996; Kretzschmar and Lee 1992). The
                        immediate task was “finished” in both senses, but the larger Atlas Project
                        required more developments. While the Mac system was widely used, it was
                        limited by restricted storage available to distribute data sets (at that
                        time, chiefly through diskettes).</p><p>As the next task in the sequence, we then ported the system to the Web, which
                        I first demonstrated at a conference in 1996 (Kretzschmar 1996b). We had
                        been working on an interactive ftp/gopher system as early as 1994, but when
                        Web technology became available we saw that it enabled perfectly what we had
                        been attempting from another direction. The Web allowed us to make all of
                        our textual data available, with many additional GIS features for locating
                        speakers and information. The Atlas Web was a significant advance for both
                        teaching and research (Kretzschmar 1997, 2002a), in line with the goals for
                        an electronic atlas first set forth nearly a decade earlier (Kretzschmar
                        1988). After a while, we wanted to do new things, so we began work on a
                        major revision of the Web site that finally came on line in 2003, which
                        added even more interactive choices such as more flexible searches and
                        tallies of the speakers and language data set. However, we kept "The Old
                        Site" as a link on the new one, so that long-time users would find what was
                        familiar to them, and also for users who did not want the greater complexity
                        that came with greater flexibility of use. We could not just move it,
                        however, because “The Old Site” had to run on a new platform and had to be
                        compatible with the extensive Python scripting that ran functions on the New
                        Site. The task of importing the Mac-based GIS system to the Web was complete
                        by 1996, but not finished until 2003 with the platform change and the final
                        touches of the more flexible site.</p><p>Still, the larger Atlas Project is nowhere near at an end. We are now
                        rethinking what the site should do, from a text-based system to one that
                        features audio and stored images along with text and GIS. This change has
                        become possible only in the last two years, as much greater network-attached
                        storage has become available (measured in Tb, before long Pb). We are now
                        the one of the largest clients at the U of Georgia institutional storage
                        array (which we share with bio-informaticists, physicists, and others
                        usually considered to be power users) because of our archival audio files,
                        and we are just at the beginning for audio and images. We now conceive of
                        our new interviews as conversational corpora, in which text transcriptions
                        serve as time-linked indices to audio files (Kretzschmar, Barry, and Kong
                        2005; Kretzschmar, Anderson, Beal, Corrigan, Opas-Hanninen, and Plichta
                        2006). While many users will want to listen to our speakers, others will
                        want to perform acoustical analyses, now a strong trend in language
                        variation research, as we ourselves now perform them (Kretzschmar, Lanehart,
                        Barry, Osiapem, and Kim 2004; Kretzschmar, Kim, and Kong 2005). Our next
                        task is to integrate sound with text and to enable acoustical research
                        functions, while maintaining our interactive GIS functions—a whole new set
                        of tools and problems from the previous task (Kretzschmar 2002b). New
                        options for both hardware and for text encoding make it possible to consider
                        the new site, just as the Web was a new option for the previous task.</p><p>So, are we "finished"? Yes, with the GIS Mark 2 of "The Old Site," but never
                        finished either with keeping that site and its successors available or with
                        new approaches to the information we keep as new technical possibilities and
                        research demands appear. We can complete particular tasks, and often we can
                        even “finish” particular tasks in the sense of polishing them for improved
                        use. Yet one experiment does not make the whole line of research. One
                        research proposal does not make the whole research program. While we can
                        succeed with each task, we must always see tasks as part of the larger
                        process that must continue if future users are still going to be able to
                        take advantage of our resources. We would be the snake chasing its tail if
                        all we did was keep polishing a single task, but we do well to make every
                        end a new beginning as new possibilities become available.</p><p>The implications of the Atlas Project situation for other projects are
                        definite and important. First of all, each project needs to consider whether
                        it wants to be a single task, or whether it will be one of those continuing
                        efforts for which any particular site or tool is just a single stage in a
                        larger, longer process. The reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables
                        makes it easier to propose and defend the single tasks, but in many cases we
                        will be more honest, and better off in the long term, if we recognize that
                        what we are doing is evolutionary rather than singular. We may have to work
                        harder to convince funding agencies to support long-term work like the Atlas
                        Project, but we must do that nonetheless. At the same time, our experience
                        shows that we can indeed identify separate stages in our work that have
                        independent value, and are thus fundable under the demands of deadlines and
                        deliverables. Indeed, the demands of funding agencies can help those of us
                        with long-term projects to organize our overall effort so that we keep it
                        vital, interesting, and in the forefront of what new technology and
                        standards can offer.</p></div1><div1><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Kirk, John">John Kirk</name></author><author><name reg="Kretzschmar, William A. Jr.">William A. Kretzschmar,

                        Publishing World</head><p rend="Presenter">David Sewell</p><p>Since late 2004, the University of Virginia Press has been offering as part
                        of its catalog a group of scholarly publications that exist in online format
                        only. Distributed under our Rotunda imprint (<xptr to="http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>),
                        these publications are a mix of born-digital, digitized print, and hybrid
                        creations in digital humanities and social sciences. Some of them began
                        independently as self-published projects, usually under the auspices of one
                        or another digital center such as the Maryland Institute for Technology in
                        the Humanities or the Electronic Text Center at the University of Virginia;
                        others were initiated by the Press. Whatever their origins, once accepted as
                        Rotunda publications they have all been subject to conditions of production
                        similar to those for our printed books, namely contracts, peer review,
                        marketing campaigns, and agreed-upon scope and deadlines. Clearly the
                        academic marketplace offers an extrinsic definition of a finished digital
                        project: if it’s for sale it must be done. </p><p>From this point of view, there is nothing inherently different between print
                        and digital scholarship. Academic publishers have long been in the business
                        of imposing admittedly arbitrary conventions, limitations, and deadlines on
                        masses of scholarly discourse in the interest of presenting them as discrete
                        units that can be offered in the marketplace as completed products (not just
                        for purchase, but also for authoritative review and citation). And this
                        always entails negotiation between the author’s ideal creation (which may
                        well be both theoretically unbounded and technically unachievable) and the
                        publisher’s available time and resources. The result is a pragmatic
                        compromise, one that has worked reasonably well for both authors and
                        readers. I would argue that the yoking of digital humanities projects to
                        theories of the open-ended text is in many ways an unfortunate by-product of
                        their initial emergence during the ascendancy of postmodernist theory, with
                        a glorification of the unfinished that may harm their credibility. When a
                        publisher issues a scholarly article, book, or digital publication, its
                        status as “finished” represents a social contract that the necessary stages
                        of peer review, editing and design, and quality assurance (proofreading,
                        plus user testing for digital work) have been performed.</p><p>Here is one possible typology of digital projects according to their degree
                        of completion at the time of publication: <list type="ordered"><item>Self-contained monograph-like objects. All
                                content and functionality that is ever intended to be part of the
                                project is present at first publication. Future updates are expected
                                only for corrections and migration as required to new software
                                environments</item><item>“Version 1.0” digital projects. All substantive
                                content is complete at first publication, but not all planned
                                aspects of the user interface. Future updates are expected to add
                                functionality that was not originally available.</item><item>Series-like projects. Content is added in
                                discrete stages; it may be quite large in extent, but is definable.
                                All intended functionality may be present in the first installment,
                                or may expand as in category #2. Print analogues would include
                                literary or documentary editions published in multiple volumes over
                                a number of years or decades, and ongoing reference works where new
                                and updated entries are added periodically.</item><item>Truly open-ended projects. The nature of the
                                content, subject matter, and/or authorship is such that no
                                particular state of the project could ever be meaningfully said to
                                represent “completion.”</item></list></p><p>To date, Rotunda has published digital projects that fit into each of the
                        first three categories. Their work flows and timetables have been more fluid
                        and sometimes more tentative than for the Press’s printed books, but not
                        different in their basic nature. It has always been possible to define what
                        will constitute a finished project, outline the steps necessary to arrive at
                        it, and establish reasonably solid deadlines for the process.</p><p>I will provide concrete examples for several Rotunda publications of
                        decisions we have made in conjunction with authors about what could or could
                        not be accomplished by a deadline, the distinctions between Version 1.0 and
                        Version 2.0 features, and the kinds of updates we have found ourselves
                        needing to make to finished publications. I will also discuss why the truly
                        open-ended projects of category 4 are more problematic for traditional
                        scholarly publishers; our experience suggests that they are the most likely
                        to require new mechanisms and/or institutions for quality control and
                        sustainability.</p></div1></div0><div0 type="EmbeddedDoc"><div1><head>Orlando Done! The Tension Between Projection and Completion in Digital
                        Scholarly Research</head><p rend="Presenter">Susan Brown</p><p rend="Presenter">Patricia Clements</p><p rend="Presenter">Isobel Grundy</p><p><emph>Orlando: Women Writers in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the
                            Present</emph> was published on the world wide web, by subscription, by
                        Cambridge University Press in June 2006 (Brown, Clements and Grundy). Its
                        freshly researched, scholarly, literary-historical prose is encoded in an
                        XML application designed for this purpose by the Orlando research team and
                        repeatedly revised and tweaked during the course of research and writing.
                        The searching functionality and the production architecture were created at
                        a later stage but largely by the same team.</p><p>The project’s cofounders were new to digital humanities research, so our
                        notions of scholarly process and completion related to conventional print
                        publications. As Claire Warwick has noted, the idea of what is “complete” or
                        “publication-ready” in academic culture has emerged from a complex set of
                        human factors relating to such matters as the attribution of credit by
                        institutions and funding structures, as well as the conception of what is
                        required intellectually for a product to be done (Warwick 368). Such factors
                        undoubtedly entered into how <emph>Orlando</emph> got done. Although our
                        projected milestones for the project broke out a number of steps, our
                        research plan and our proposal to our funding agency had projected a single
                        moment of completion when the planned electronic history would be ready
                        alongside several related print volumes of scholarship. Once underway, we
                        found getting done more challenging than anticipated, as the enormity of
                        what we had undertaken on the technical side became evident. This is clearly
                        a risk of methodologically experimental research of any kind, and
                        particularly relevant to digital humanities work. One thing that seems
                        crucial in the design of digital humanities projects is to design projects
                        modularly, with a number of discrete and in some way publishable
                        deliverables. <emph>Orlando</emph> struggled for funding in later stages as
                        a result, we believe, of research design that end-loaded deliverables,
                        combined with a funding environment that was not attuned to digital
                        humanities work.</p><p>It soon became clear that it would be necessary to stage the completion of
                        the project. We uncoupled the electronic from the print publication in terms
                        of timing, so that the former stands alone initially, even though we will
                        integrate the print volume material, now being written, with the existing
                        published textbase. Although over the course of <emph>Orlando</emph>’s
                        development we felt some pressure from both prospective users and from the
                        digital humanities community to publish at an interim stage a small portion
                        of the electronic materials, we held back for two major reasons. First, we
                        had a strong sense that there were intellectual demands for a critical mass
                        of materials with a certain degree of coverage. We wouldn’t be “done”, for
                        instance, without having completed the materials on Virginia Woolf and,
                        because much feminist work has resisted the establishment of a small canon
                        of female writers at the expense of others, Woolf needed to be situated in
                        relation to her less prominent contemporaries. Staging releases of material
                        is increasingly common for digital electronic projects, but we would contend
                        that a certain critical mass remains necessary to establish scholarly
                        confidence in quality of a resource, although what that critical mass is
                        will differ from project to project. Secondly, because our customized tagset
                        required us to build a fairly complex XML delivery system, we felt we needed
                        a relatively “complete” interface, with some usability testing, that could
                        demonstrate to users some strengths of the markup into which the project
                        invested so much time and intellectual labour. For these strengths of the
                        system to be apparent, we again needed a critical mass of materials for
                        hyperlinking and search results. Research conceptualization and publication
                        options are thus both crucial determinants of what “done” will mean for a
                        particular project.</p><p><emph>Orlando</emph>’s decision to publish with an online press, in one sense
                        made it easy to know when the textbase was done. Published is traditionally
                        done (though even then, glitches in getting the textbase up and running on
                        the publisher’s server meant that we actually celebrated the publication
                        some days before it happened). But published electronic projects don’t get
                        put on a shelf in a library. Being unconstrained by the materiality of print
                        reinforces the arbitrariness of deciding that something is done in the sense
                        of complete, defined in the <title level="m">Oxford English
                        Dictionary</title> as “Having all its parts or members; comprising the full
                        number or amount; embracing all the requisite items, details, topics, etc.;
                        entire, full.” In this sense, <emph>Orlando</emph> remains undone, and our
                        contract with our publisher recognises this fact by stipulating for updates. </p><p>Regular updating of content (more entries, expansion of existing entries,
                        more contextual material) has already, therefore, begun with an update
                        adding new material in January 2007. This is an obvious publicity tool.
                        Enhancement of functionality (quite apart from action rendered necessary by,
                        for instance, the advent of a new version of Internet Explorer), though it
                        may be less productive of instant, visible returns than enhancement of
                        content for most users, is nevertheless going to be vital for achieving the
                        status of a first-stop general reference work, and for retaining its
                        currency in the evolving electronic environment.</p><p>This continuing updating of both content and functionality means that the
                        core team must be held together and the project must continue to find
                        funding. As part of its strategy of sustainability, and with the purpose of
                        giving <emph>Orlando</emph> a continuing institutional identity, the
                        textbase has been licensed to the University of Alberta. This gives a much
                        broader constituency an interest in the project’s success, and ensures that
                        the team of this moment forms a continuity with the future as well as the
                        past. It would be easy to cast all of this proliferating responsibility
                        somewhat negatively, as though continuing work on an already-published
                        project were a burden, but the fact is that all of the previous research,
                        writing and encoding that has been done towards publication will work
                        together with user feedback to enable new and newly informed research. Both
                        expansion of content (even into new areas) and enhancement of functionality
                        represent continuing research potential, even while they ensure that “done”
                        can – need? -- never be anything but a figure of speech.</p><p>Apart from the issues of sustainability, the degree of <emph>Orlando</emph>’s
                        long-term success still hangs in the balance. Publication is, potentially,
                        the beginning of the road to success, not its end. We would define success
                        not merely as the selling of subscriptions (though obviously
                        <emph>Orlando</emph> needs to do well in the marketplace if a substantial
                        portion of its funding needs are to be met from royalties), but also as the
                        establishing and maintaining of a pattern of heavy use of the textbase by
                        its subscribers: indeed, a pattern of reliance on it as the first stop for
                        either specialist or general information. We would further define it as
                        having users exploit the broad range of possibilities represented by the
                        encoding. </p><p>This abstract, written four months after publication, is in every way
                        provisional, but it is clear from early (and so far highly encouraging) user
                        feedback in the form of emails and a single brief review that for most of
                        our users the electronic side of the textbase is ancillary to the content.
                        They comment on content, apparently assuming that the new resource should
                        stand or fall on content alone. Nevertheless, those who built the textbase
                        understand that this feedback must be to a large extent influenced by the
                        users’ responses, not directly articulated and perhaps not even consciously
                        formulated, to <emph>Orlando</emph>’s functionality. </p><p>At this early stage most user messages come from the literary-specialist part
                        of an audience which will hopefully also take in computing specialists and
                        general readers. Most messages comment on the coverage of individual authors
                        (or very particular groups of authors), on whom the commenting user tends to
                        be an expert, so that feedback is skewed both towards the literary and
                        towards the individual author entries, which are in electronic terms the
                        least sophisticated part of the text. Several user messages have praised the
                        “links”. This likely means the hyperlinking of words tagged as names,
                        organization names, titles, or places. Such linking is an obvious and
                        elementary feature of myriad electronic texts. It seems therefore that users
                        who said they appreciated the links probably had in mind the way that the
                        encoding sorts and organises the contexts in which linked words are used,
                        and the very particular design of the links screen to convey this
                        information. Messages which praise the searching, or the navigation, are
                        even harder to decode.</p><p>We look forward to more comment on functionality and production, and further
                        reports from general-interest users who have begun, for instance, by looking
                        at coverage of gardening, as well as to a breakdown of statistics about
                        kinds of use. In addition, we want to undertake standard usability testing.
                        Log analysis would also be invaluable if we could overcome some technical
                        hurdles. This sense in which work on <emph>Orlando</emph> remains “undone”
                        should be common to most digital humanities projects: if we are to evolve
                        useful tools and resources, both our own and those to come, we need
                        carefully to assess how people approach and use them.</p><p>This project directs its research towards two practically inexhaustible
                        fields (women’s literary history and the capacity of computing, and
                        specifically of extensive XML markup, to serve the needs of this humanities
                        topic). Neither of those fields becomes closed to further investigation by
                        the fact that the project is “done” in the sense that it has reached the
                        public. For this project, so closely focused on its major deliverable, the
                        new, post-publication phase has simply opened a third area of enquiry: that
                        of the relations between <emph>Orlando</emph> and its users.</p></div1><div1><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><monogr><author><name reg="Brown, Susan">Susan Brown</name></author><author><name reg="Clements, Patricia">Patricia Clements</name></author><author><name reg="Grundy, Isobel">Isobel Grundy</name></author><title level="m">Orlando: Women’s Writing in the British Isles from
