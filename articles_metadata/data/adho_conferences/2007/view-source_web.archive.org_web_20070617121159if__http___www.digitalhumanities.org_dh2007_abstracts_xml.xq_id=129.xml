                    applies to a study of dance writing.</p></div0><div0><head>Argument/Premise</head><p>Linguists and Computational Linguistic
                    Engineers who have studied language for special purposes (LSP) generally agree
                    that the lexicon used by those in a specialist discipline offers insight into
                    the concepts and ideologies of that discipline. As Dance is a specialist
                    discipline, it should then follow that the lexicon of dance writing can
                    demonstrate aesthetic concepts and theoretical approaches and beliefs through
                    generalized language patterns detected using KWIC methods. This research
                    supports that contention in that the empirical approach (specifically key words
                    in context), when used against a corpus of 1.4 million words from written dance
                    texts, does offer a means to develop an ontology of the discipline of dance. One
                    ontological example supported by the empirical data is that of both hierarchical
                    and rhizomatic structures of relationships between participants in the dance
                    event. Through this example, this paper will demonstrate both the process and
                    analytical product of using corpus linguistics methods and models to develop an
                    ontology of Dance.</p></div0><div0><head>Analytical Method</head><p>Due to a dearth of research into dance
                    writing, especially in the area of corpus linguistics, there were no tested,
                    dance-specific models on which to base this study. Therefore, this research
                    contains a variety of methodologies and approaches in the disciplines of corpus
                    linguistics and dance analysis. The corpus methodologies are based on the work
                    of Sinclair (2003), Ahmad (2002), and Biber (1998). Linguistic analyses based on
                    KWIC (key words in context) such as word frequencies, collocations,
                    concordances, and POS tagging were performed on the data generated by computing
                    tools (e.g. System Quirk, Unitex, CLAWS). Additional methods proposed by
                    Traboulsi et al (2003) for identifying a local grammar were used against samples
                    of critical texts (i.e. dance performance reviews). Finally, through a
                    two-pronged approach, the data was analysed using the analytical modes of
                    description, interpretation, and evaluation proposed for dance by Adshead et al
                    (1988).</p><p>After establishing the written language of Dance as a specialist language (or
                    language for special purposes) through the frequency of open class words in the
                    top 100 most frequently used words, weirdness factors, and Z-scores, the data
                    was analysed in a variety of ways. For example, for the purposes of this
                    particular study into ontological relationships between participants, general
                    concepts were identified by focusing on those open class words (OCWs) within the
                    top 100 most frequently used words in a general dance corpus (the Surrey Dance
                    Corpus, or SDC). Finding that the OCWs included several conceptual possibilities
                    which appeared at times to cross conceptual boundaries, it became apparent that
                    a method for categorisation was required to provide distinctions between the
                    concepts. Therefore, the analytical model introduced by Adshead et al (1988) was
                    used for the categorisation. This model calls for a deconstruction of a dance
                    work via description, interpretation, and evaluation based upon identifiable
                    characteristics of the individual work. The identified distinctions include not
                    only the movement and production components, but also concepts of form, concepts
                    through which we view a dance, and concepts particular to a dance. After
                    determining the conceptual categories, the analysis went beyond the top 100 most
                    frequently used words, and considered the relative frequencies of the concept
                    words in the subsequent groups of most frequently used words (top 200, 300,
                    etc.). Word counts also were performed on personal pronouns and conceptual
                    metaphor (using Charteris-Black’s method). Finally, collocations and
                    concordances using the concept words as target words were generated and
                    analysed.</p><p>Each step was repeated using additional corpora: a group of sub-corpora defined
                    by content of the texts and/or writers’ particular activity within the
                    discipline (e.g. critic, scholar, choreographer); and a corpus focused on one
                    choreographer (used as a case study throughout the research).</p></div0><div0><head>Conclusion</head><p>Through this research into dance writing,
                    Dance can be shown to be a LSP with a lexicon specific to the discipline. So,
                    too, have several unexpected patterns been detected that reflect various
                    concepts and ideologies, one of which is that of the relationships between and
                    among the participants in the dance event (e.g. dancer, choreographer, audience,
                    critic, company). The relational connections are further supported by a general
                    belief in the collective, as shown through word counts and concordances.
                    Additional methods used in dance analysis provide a structure for studying and
                    further clarifying the empirically generated patterns. The choreographic and
                    analytic concepts in Dance as they are perceived and expressed through written
                    dance texts demonstrate not only the importance of these concepts to specialists
                    in the discipline of Dance, but also the benefit of using the corpus linguistics
                    approach to studying dance writing.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><monogr><author><name reg="Adshead, J.">J.
