                    (CAT) system with the aim of aiding online volunteer translators, who are
                    involved in translating online electronic documents in their free time. In the
                    following, we will first describe the characteristics of target users, and
                    discuss the basic concept of the system within which the choice of functions and
                    system specifications has been made. Then we will describe the prototype CAT
                    system which we are now experimentally providing to a limited number of online
                    translators.</p></div0><div0><head><label>2.</label> Background and basic concepts</head><p>Many CAT systems have been developed to date [see Kay 1997 for background
                    information and Gow 2003 for a comparison of several CAT systems]. While some
                    existing CAT systems have proved useful for some translators and translation
                    companies, volunteer translators who work online do not use these systems
                    [Kageura, et. al. 2006; see also Fulford and Granell Zafra 2004 in relation to
                    the situation of freelance translators in Britain], for a variety of reasons:
                    they are too expensive for personal use (except for Omega-T, which is free
                    [Omega-T 2007]); they have more functions than are necessary; such translators
                    are not under pressure from managers to keep a translation log in order to
                    control quality, etc. This shows that some sort of CAT-lite system is required
                    by online translators, which shares some basic functionalities with existing
                    commercial CAT systems but with a different emphasis and overall design
                    principle [Boitet, et. al. 2005].</p><p>We have therefore been engaged in developing a CAT system for online volunteer
                    translators, based on the principle of maximally aiding the translators' work
                    flow by removing existing obstacles, rather than providing extra functions which
                    translators have never used. Thus we are taking a bottom-up approach in
                    developing system functions, reflecting the concrete requirements of
                    translators. Another essential principle we have adopted is that it should be
                    translators who make decisions, not the system.</p><p>After consulting some 15 volunteer translators working online, we identified the
                    following issues as being particularly important: <list type="ordered"><item>Most English-to-Japanese volunteer translators do not have native
                            level command in the source language (English). As a result, unlike such
                            CAT systems as TransType [Macklovitch 2006] which assume that the target
                            users are bilingual, well-trained and professional translators, and
                            therefore try to reduce the time used for inputting the target language
                            text, the main point to be tackled in our environment is making the
                            reference lookup process as easy as possible.</item><item>When selecting translation expressions, translators examine various
                            possibilities. When necessary, they look up more than one dictionary and
                            check other information resources such as print encyclopaedias or
                            Wikipedia, etc. The CAT system should facilitate the translation process
                            by reducing the effort involved in looking up multiple resources. As it
                            is not the mission of the system to decide on behalf of translators,
                            good output for the system is considered to be a range of candidates and
                            information that translators can take into account in making decisions,
                            and not simply the same expression as translators chose.</item><item>Some online translators do not use online dictionaries, because doing
                            so breaks the rhythm of translation and hinders the construction of the
                            target text. Partly because of this, some prefer using print or
                            standalone electronic dictionaries. A few use dictionaries built into
                            the text editor, but none of them are fully satisfied with the
                            dictionary look-up environment.</item><item>There is a pressing need for improved idiom and phrasal look-up. The
                            importance of this function derives from two factors: (a) many
                            translators, even experienced ones, have relatively less knowledge of
                            idioms than of words, and (b) some idioms may not be identified as such
                            by translators, because they make sense without an idiomatic
                            interpretation. This leads to translation mistakes.</item><item>As our system does not aim to choose and restrict information on
                            behalf of translators by using "sophisticated" NLP techniques, the
                            amount of information it provides will naturally tend to increase. As a
                            result, the user-interface becomes an important issue.</item></list></p></div0><div0><head><label>3.</label> The prototype system QRedit</head><p>Based on these concepts and requirements, we are currently developing a prototype
                    system that supports online translators. The system runs on the TOMCAT server
                    and users access the system through a Web browser. The overall image of QRedit
                    is shown in the figure. The browser screen is divided into two areas: (i) the
                    source text area, and (ii) the target text area. The users can choose between
                    horizontal and perpendicular division of the areas, i.e. source text area on the
                    bottom and target language area on the top, or source text area on the left and
                    target language area on the right. The two areas are linked with a synchronised
                    scroll function.</p><div1><head><label>3.1</label> Functions in the source text area</head><p>After a translator inputs the URL of a Web page (in which case the system
                        analyses the tags and extracts the textual area automatically) or copies and
                        pastes text into the source text area, the system activates the dictionary
                        look-up functions. When the user clicks on a particular word in the source
                        text area with the mouse, the system shows the translation candidates in a
                        pop-up window.</p><div2><head>Dictionary look-up functions</head><p>The system displays translation candidates from the dictionaries
                            incorporated into the system [Sanseido 2004; Eijiro 2006]. The system
                            does not only incorporates simple word look-up functions but also
                            incorporates flexible idiom look-up functions. The idiom look-up
                            functions can match such idiom occurrences as "He said that with his big
                            fat tongue in his big fat cheek" with the dictionary entry "with one's
                            tongue in one's cheek." This function has not been realised in any
                            English-Japanese MT systems we have checked, and while some CAT systems
                            realise similar functions through approximate matching, they do not
                            specifically target the look-up of idioms with their variations. The
                            system alerts users to idioms by marking them with an underline.</p></div2><div2><head>Displaying translation candidates</head><p>The system can display information in two ways. One is a small pop-up
                            window displayed within the source text area, which includes only target
                            word candidates. The other is a large pop-up window that displays all
                            the information given under the headings in the dictionaries. The latter
                            is particularly useful when translators wish to examine related
                            information in detail before deciding on a translation, while the former
                            is convenient for more straightforward dictionary look-up.</p></div2></div1><div1><head><label>3.2</label> The connection between the source text area and the
                        target text area</head><p>Translators can paste a selected expression from the list of candidates in
                        the pop-up area to the target text area by clicking the mouse. The system
                        also provides automatic transformation of numerical expressions to Japanese
                        conventions and the pasting of HTML tags. This mouse operation does not
                        affect the keyboard operation, and whatever the user does with the mouse,
                        the keyboard cursor always stays on the target text editing area, so that
                        the user can input translated text continuously.</p></div1><div1><head><label>3.3</label> Target text area</head><p>The target text area consists of the open source Web editor FCKeditor, which
                        offers WYSIWYG textual decoration and editing, as well as saving and loading
                        functions. The text can be saved in HTML as well as in basic textual format.
                        The target area is split into paragraph spaces which correspond to the
                        source text.</p></div1></div0><div0><head><label>4.</label> Conclusions</head><p>We are currently running a prototype system of QRedit that incorporates these
                    functions, and accumulating feedback from a few online volunteer translators.
                    The feedback that we have obtained so far can be categorised into two types:
                        <list type="ordered"><item>The need to refine existing functions and improve basic usability,
                            e.g., to improve the accuracy of the extraction of the textual area when
                            the user specifies an URL for the source text area.</item><item>The need to incorporate higher-level functions, e.g. to allow the user
                            to specify the register of the text that (s)he is translating, in order
                            to have the system block irrelevant dictionary information from being
                            displayed.</item><item>In addition, we are developing a module that automatically compiles
                            bilingual technical terminologies from the Web, a module that detects
                            existing translation pairs and recycles the translation information, and
                            a system that detects candidates for transliterated expressions of
                            proper names from the Web, all of which will be integrated into the
                            QRedit environment.</item></list></p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Boitet, Christian">Christian Boitet</name></author><author><name reg="Bey, Youcef">Youcef Bey</name></author><author><name reg="Kageura, Kyo">Kyo Kageura</name></author><title level="a">Main Research Issues in Building Web Services for
