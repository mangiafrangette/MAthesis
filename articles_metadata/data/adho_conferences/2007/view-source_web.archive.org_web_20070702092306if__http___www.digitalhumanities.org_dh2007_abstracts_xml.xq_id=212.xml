                    important area of research in the digital humanities that has received
                    relatively little attention to date. There are some exceptions. Matt Jensen’s
                    SemTime, Johanna Drucker and Bethany Nowviskie’s Temporal Modeling Project, the
                    Center for History and New Media’s Timeline Builder, and Bruce Robertson’s
                    Historical Event Markup Language are important projects that have been presented
                    to or developed within this community. However, in spite of these exceptions,
                    the limits of work in this area are clear when compared, for instance, with the
                    closely allied area of spatial modeling and historical GIS. In recent years,
                    interactive digital maps have become increasingly prevalent. In addition to the
                    ubiquitous Google Earth, other map resources produced by universities and
                    textbook publishers allow users to pan and zoom, hyperlink to related content,
                    control layers of spatial information, and select temporal ranges. However,
                    history textbooks are filled with timelines as well as maps, and temporal
                    thinking is critical not only to history, but to many other disciplines besides.
                    Nevertheless, in contrast to mapping, the problem of modeling and visualizing
                    time in an interactive and digital environment has received almost no attention.</p><p>With the hope of raising the visibility of current efforts and inspiring new
                    research, this panel brings together six individuals working in the area of
                    temporal modeling and interactive timeline development. Our goal is to introduce
                    current developments; to identify interesting and significant areas of
                    development that will make temporal modeling and visualization into a robust
                    field of research, and to discuss models for an interactive database and
                    historical event visualization system.</p><p>Some components of a historical event model are well developed. Temporal
                    ontologies such as DAML-Time and ISO 19108 offer essential guidance for
                    formalizing temporal objects. The Historical Event Markup Language and, more
                    recently, the Named Time Period Directory Standard have developed XML models for
                    describing historical events. Creative efforts to improve timeline visualization
                    are surprisingly limited, but there are several noteworthy exemplars. The MIT
                    Media Lab’s SIMILE project has an intuitive and flexible interface and allows
                    several timelines at different scales to be manipulated together. However, it
                    implicitly embodies a historical model of individual unambiguous and unrelated
                    events rather than complex narratives, replicating the “tickmarks on a line”
                    model familiar from static textbook and wall chart timelines. By contrast, the
                    Temporal Modeling Project and SemTime are visualization experiments that allow
                    developers to incorporate agency, causality and relationships.</p><p>Better handling of relationships is among most important issues for future
                    development of temporal modeling in the digital humanities. Historical events
                    have complex, multiple and perspectivally unique relationships to one another.
                    Historical events and narratives also all have a relationship to spatial
                    information. Events occur somewhere, even when they are global, and the same
                    event (the Neolithic, modernity) may occur at quite different times in different
                    places. Finally, timelines and event databases can be considered as components
                    of holistic information systems. All of these issues will be explored in this
                    roundtable session. Other topics that have not been addressed by previous
                    researchers in temporal modeling include the representation of temporal and
                    temporo-spatial ambiguity and uncertainty, and the specifications for historical
                    event systems and services with multiple users. These topics, too, will feature
                    in our planned roundtable. All of these areas have implications for modeling of
                    both data and systems, and also for very new kinds of visual representation.</p><p>The proposed Modeling and Visualizing Historical Narrative Roundtable brings
                    together a number of individuals who are working actively in this area. This
                    panel includes some individuals (Drucker and Robertson) who have been
                    researching temporal modeling and visualization for some time, and others
                    (Johnson, Lancaster, Mostern, all affiliated with the Electronic Cultural Atlas
                    Initiative) who have worked primarily on spatial visualization for history and
                    the humanities and have begun to engage in research on temporality as an
                    extension of that interest.</p><p><emph rend="bold">Ruth Mostern</emph>, as panel organizer, will introduce the
                    panel with a discussion of work-to-date on temporal modeling and possible
                    directions for future research. The rest of the panelists will discuss their own
                    areas of development, as follows: <list type="unordered"><item><emph rend="bold">Ian Johnson</emph> will discuss developments in the
                            Heurist generic collaborative content creation system and the TimeMap
                            spatial browser to create a model and visualizer for historical events,
                            illustrated through the example of a Silk Road timeline project. He will
                            discuss the underlying data structures, planned developments in the data
                            model used to describe historical events, and research on improved
                            visual methods of entering and viewing the web of relationships between
                            historical events, including timeline visualizations.</item><item><emph rend="bold">Lewis Lancaster</emph> will demonstrate the What,
                            Where, When and Who prototype for library catalogue searching and web
                            browsing. In this system, a directory of named events extracted from
                            Library of Congress subject headings serves as the basis for structured
                            searching. Searchers can browse a library catalogue by using a timeline
                            and a map linked to the time period directory and a place-name gazetteer
                            rather than conducting a traditional text-based search. The user may
                            expand the search from a library catalogue to include Wikipedia and
                            other on-line systems. Named events, place names, and personal names are
                            interrelated to allow complex search parameters.</item><item><emph rend="bold">Bruce Robertson</emph> will talk about the latest
                            developments for the Historical Event Markup Language. The first of
                            these is an RDF syntax for historical events that makes historical
                            markup of timed, labeled events associated with persons, places and
                            keywords simple for students and others. The other development is the
                            use of OWL web ontology reasoning to express chronological reasoning
                            (i.e. how we know that the battle of Marathon was in 490 BC). This will
                            be associated with RDF reification</item><item><emph rend="bold">Johanna Drucker</emph>, an important researcher in
                            this area, regrets that she will not able to attend the conference due
                            to a prior commitment. However, she has offered to produce
                            visualizations based on her recent work to be presented by the
                            conference organizer. </item></list></p><p>Because of the large number of presenters and the desirability of open dialogue,
                    we are proposing a roundtable format. The panel organizer and each presenter
                    (including Drucker <emph>in absentia</emph>) will make a presentation of 10 minutes. Each
                    presenter will discuss his or her current work and future plans in the area of
                    temporal modeling and visualization. This will allow time for a moderated
                    discussion among the presenters and between the presenters and the audience.</p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
