                and the result of that practice. It assumes a digital text resource with a browser
                interface that allow users to associate N encodings with N texts in the resource.
                Users need have no other connection with the resource than their using it and
                constraints should be minimal; hence the encoding is <emph>distributed</emph> among
                multiple creators and multiple conceptual approaches. To realize their encoding(s)
                users may ignore existing encodings; they may apply one tagset to one text, or to
                multiple texts, or they may apply multiple tagsets to one text, or multiple texts;
                any element they create can reference any other element created by themselves or by
                someone else. Thus the resource’s encoding becomes <emph>multivalent</emph> in part
                and in whole.</p><p>A cluster of activities defines the space of distributed multivalent encoding,
                including annotation, keywording (including “folksonomizing”), editing, and
                humanities criticism. For any one component of DME anticipatory previous work
                    exists.<note n="1">For example, the resource based around Pico Della Mirandola’s
                    Conclusiones CM publicae disputandae (PICO) features an annotation system which
                    is also employed by the Virtual Humanities Lab (VHL), a resource whose
                    development plan includes implementing a form of DME.</note> Any newness of DME
                lies only in the surprising fact that the components have never been fully
                assembled, though they have all been present for some years. Now, however, we can
                see DME emerging, albeit in hesitant, not-fully-developed forms.<note n="2">See
                    LIMNER, for example: a site intended as a proof-of-concept DME resource, still
                    in an early stage.</note></p><p>A DME resource has a base text (or texts), a web interface for creating encoding, and
                a mechanism for storing encoding; these three things enable all subsequent
                activities: editing, deleting, retrieving, searching, etc. Considering each of the
                three parts in a little more detail we will see few real technical obstacles in
                DME’s path.</p><p>Distributed multivalent encoding starts with a reference base digital text. A
                reference base text should be clearly marked as such by the resource managers. Only
                they may change it (or give someone else permission to change it), and any change
                must be well publicized. A reference base text must have a well-defined beginning
                and end, and a well-defined internal base reference structure. While it is certainly
                possible to regard either the simple byte sequence or the character sequence as the
                base reference structure and then link encodings to byte or character offsets, this
                is not a robust solution. Practicality suggests the internal base reference
                structure should itself be an encoding; convenience and practicality further suggest
                a presentation-based encoding, on the grounds that presentation in a medium reflects
                a community’s sense of that medium’s main communicative organization and delivery
                units (Caton, 2001). A TEI Lite encoding (<xptr to="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines2/index.xml.ID=lite" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), for example, or one conforming to DLF Level 4 (<xptr to="http://www.diglib.org/standards/tei.htm#level4" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), would be suitable. We should stress, though, that the reference structure makes
                no claim to being representationally definitive. Within the structure, distinctions
                between tags and #PCDATA are <emph>purely structural</emph> and do not define either
                “text” (as general phenomenon) or “the text”. A supplementary encoding – ie. an
                encoding created by a user – associates with <emph>the text as represented within
                    the reference structure</emph>, not “the text” as some reified cultural object.
                If we follow the reasoning of Renear et al on the relationship
                between FRBR entities and XML documents, we would probably consider the base
                reference text a <emph>manifestation</emph>of an expression, especially because we
                incline towards a presentation-based encoding (which, as Caton argues,
                is what OHCO-style encoding <emph>is</emph>)(Renear et al, 2004, Caton 2001). The FRBR vocabulary, however, hardly
                resolves the problematic semantics of the common phrases “the text” and “a text”.
                Hence our insistence on treating the internal reference structure as definitive only
                within the DME resource as a system. Indeed the very point of a DME resource is to
                allow users to create encodings that they can treat as definitive <emph>for their
                    purposes</emph>.</p><p>The web interface presents the base text to the user and allows the user to associate
                encoding(s) with parts of the text. The encoding must allow for multiple overlapping
                hierarchies, and so a format such as CLIX/TEI HORSE should be used (DeRose, 2004,
                Bauman, 2005). While the interface programming might be complex in terms of having
                to manage numerous details, the required functionality is straightforward. The
                actual mechanics a resource employs are not important, except as regards the degree
                to which they make the process awkward. They will vary according to programmers’
                preferences and with changes in technology. The proof-of-concept Limner interface,
                for example, uses HORSE and relies on explicit element IDs and user-selected strings
                to mark where start and end tags go. DeRose notes that ‘[o]ne often hears that … IDs
                are somehow "safe" pointers into documents (DeRose, 2004). However, this is not
                true; they are at most “safer” than many other methods.’ His point is well taken.
                However, there must be <emph>some</emph> reference system, and unless we resign
                ourselves to inline markup and unwieldy file sizes, it seems preferable to keep the
                supplementary markup separate from the base text and use a system that is (to view
                the cup as half full rather than half empty) <emph>at least</emph>safer than many
                other methods. A combination of full XPath plus element ID plus a string of
                sufficient length to have a strong chance of being unique should allow a DME
                resource to consistently associate a stored out-of-line element with its proper
                position with respect to the internal base reference system. The Limner
                implementation is rather crude and already dated; the DOM scripting features of
                current browsers together with wider availability of XPath handling functions in
                programming languages offer many opportunities to improve upon it.</p><p>The actual details of storage are also of limited importance. Relational databases
                can hold the information (as with Limner) but it seems likely that future DME
                resources will use native XML databases.</p><p>Without downplaying the amount of work involved, we can confidently say that DME is
                perfectly possible with current technology and that DME resources will be built in
                the near future. The real unknowns (and potential problems) lie on the social side.
                Who gets to encode? Will all supplementary encodings be equal, or will some be “more
                equal” than others? Will encodings be moderated? Will differently encoded and
                competing base reference texts proliferate until the very notion of a base reference
                becomes utterly compromised? Will a class system of resources emerge, driven by a
                scholarly fear of non-scholars’ contributions? The relative success of Wikipedia in
                the face of all the things that could have stopped it should make us optimistic.
                Probably DME will initially develop in constrained forms, with resources authorizing
                users and retaining ultimate editorial control over supplementary encodings. In time
                we hope to see distributed multivalent encoding become a widespread, democratic
                practice</p></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Bauman, Syd">Syd Bauman</name></author><title level="a">TEI HORSEing Around</title></analytic><monogr><title level="m">Proceedings of Extreme Markup Languages 2005, Montréal,
