                    information and knowledge, but also in terms of objective and subjective value,
                    is the <emph rend="italics">object</emph>. Text is an important medium in
                    retrieving objects, or information about these objects. Even in cases of
                    non-textual cultural heritage collections, text plays a crucial role, since text
                    is the pervasive medium used for metadata, next to numeric identification codes
                    and measurements (Chapman, 2005). At the same time, language is a noisy and
                    ambiguous medium, and usage of textual metadata ultimately implies robustness to
                    noise and proper disambiguation. If the goal is to automate the process of
                    searching and retrieving information about objects from digitized metadata,
                        <emph rend="italics">language technology</emph> can aid in disambiguating,
                    translating, and correcting textual metadata (Bontcheva et al., 2002). In this
                    paper we describe ongoing work in the MITCH (Mining Information in Texts from
                    the Cultural Heritage) project in which we employ diverse language technologies
                    to enrich textual metadata of a large object collection in the natural history
                    domain.</p><p>Textual metadata can take many forms. Many document collections are made
                    searchable through the use of index systems (pre-digital as well as digital)
                    that use keywords, titles, and proper names (e.g. of authors). Alternatively,
                    objects may be described more verbosely in annotations, captions, explanatory
                    texts for educational purposes or exhibitions, or scholarly publications. A
                    third type of textual metadata is the thesaurus or ontology, which aims to
                    capture a standardized list or set of terms that occur in the domain, and
                    possibly some basic relations between them such as synonymy, hyponymy, and
                    hyperonymy, or more domain-specific relations. Fourth, auxiliary resources
                    peripheral to the domain may exist that contain information of overlapping
                    interest, such as lists of geographical names.</p><p>There is a need, clearly expressed by many cultural heritage institutions, for
                    digitizing the metadata of cultural heritage collections, in order to make them
                    searchable and accessible at unprecedented scales. After the basic metadata is
                    digitized, allowing simple keyword-based search, an important next step is the
                        <emph rend="italics">enrichment</emph>phase, the result of which enables
                    more complex and advanced types of search that better resemble the typical
                    questions of scholarly researchers. The key step in the enrichment phase is to
                    link all resources into a single network. By establishing all meaningful links,
                    a particular object effectively becomes a node in this network, meaningfully
                    connected to all other entities that have a direct relation to that object, such
                    as the artist who created it, or the location in which it was found.</p><p>By traversing the network, a search engine can explore complex relations among
                    sets of objects, and unions and intersections of such sets, allowing, for
                    instance, biologists to perform large-scale searches for patterns and trends,
                    such as the occurrence of animals in a certain family, in particular stretches
                    of time (e.g. the last century) and space (e.g. the Amazon rain forest). To
                    achieve this goal, we develop language technology of two types: (1)
                    preprocessing technology for the automatical correction and normalization of our
                    textual resources, and (2) metadata enrichment technology for identifying
                    relevant concepts in all textual metadata, and linking all resources into a
                    connected, searchable network.</p></div0><div0><head>Preprocessing: Automatic metadata cleanup</head><p>The first step in enriching textual metadata is to make sure that the textual
                    metadata is as correct and consistent as possible. In Sporleder et al. (2006a,
                    2006b) we describe two complementary methods. The first method, <emph rend="italics">horizontal correction</emph>, aims at correcting inconsistent
                    values in a database record based on the other values in that record, and all
                    other records in the same database, while the second method, <emph rend="italics">vertical correction</emph>, focuses on values which were
                    entered in the wrong column. Both methods are language-independent, rely solely
                    on the database itself, and are fully automatic. Their novelty lies in the fact
                    that they can deal with textual material in database cells, where most
                    traditional error correction methods only work for numeric (Hawkins, 1980) or
                    atomic categorial data (Knorr and Ng, 1998). </p><p>In a range of experiments on a natural history specimen database we observed that
                    the two methods can effectively zoom in on the errors in the database. Instead
                    of having to manually inspect all 16 thousand records in our database, each
                    characterized by 47 attributes (columns), the methods only flag in the order of
                    several hundreds of errors. The errors flagged tend to capture well above 90% of
                    all actual errors, and typically raise about as many false alarms as proper
                    hits. The method is implemented into a prototype system that draws the attention
                    of the expert user, with simple visual means, to alleged errors in the database.
                    The user is able to approve and effectuate the correction, or to enter another
                    correction, or to dismiss the error message.</p><p>Other cleanup methods currently under investigation are the identification and
                    normalization of different language versions of the same location names (Van
                    Erp, 2006), the disambiguation of proper names referring to different entities
                    (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and the normalization of time expressions.</p></div0><div0><head>Automatic metadata generation</head><p>After resources have been cleaned and normalized, similar methods can be used to
                    generate more metadata, in order to improve access to the core data. Again, we
                    follow a strategy which is fully automatic and completely self-sufficient, not
                    relying on any source other than the data itself, because in the typical
                    cultural heritage domain there is little useful background resource besides the
                    data itself.</p><p>As a first example, Sporleder et al. (2006c) describe a <emph rend="italics">bootstrapping</emph> method to generate lists of proper names of persons,
                    locations, and taxonomic animal names from a specimen database. In general, an
                    object database offers its own structured annotation by means of its column
                    titles, such as "location" (of the place where an animal specimen was found).
                    Gathering the contents of cells in a particular column results in a list of
                    named entities of that particular type, that may be found elsewhere in the same
                    database, e.g. in comment fields, or in other textual metadata resources such as
                    field books or scholarly articles. These texts can then be linked to the entries
                    in the database that contain the same location name, and the occurrences of the
                    name in the other texts can be automatically annotated as being "location"
                    names.</p><p>In ongoing work we explore the usage of clustering methods to discover <emph rend="italics">hidden</emph> events that are not explicitly coded or
                    mentioned, but that do explain certain groupings of objects. An example in the
                    natural history domain is the concept of <emph rend="italics">expedition</emph>,
                    which is not coded in the database, but which is the cause for certain animals
                    to be found within a concentrated period of time in a relatively restricted area
                    by the same person or group of persons. Adding such entities and linking them to
                    the objects that are associated to them, makes the object database searchable in
                    more than the original dimensions.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Bagga, A.">A.
