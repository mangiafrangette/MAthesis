                    academic colleagues - including those on appointment and promotion panels -
                    still need to be convinced, and even more so funders. If we want backing for the
                    use and further development of digital resources, both data and processes, we
                    need to collect more extensive concrete evidence of the ways in which they
                    enable us to do research better, or to do research we would not otherwise be
                    able to do, or to generate new knowledge in entirely new ways. Since the value
                    of humanities research as a whole is qualitative, not quantitative, it is
                    qualitative evidence in particular we should be looking for: digital resources
                    providing the means not simply of doing research, but of doing excellent
                    research.</p><p>One major task is therefore to accumulate a body of evidence of what researchers
                    have done, and achieved, with digital resourcesâ€” evidence that is not always as
                    easy to find as one would wish. But what researchers do with these resources is
                    also dependent on the nature and quality of the resources themselves: their
                    academic rigour and completeness, and their technological design. Where a new
                    digital research resource is created, to what extent does an assessment need to
                    focus on the methods of analysis, design and construction of the resource, and
                    to what extent on its usefulness to the community or communities of researchers?
                    How important are the technical standards adopted? What about sustainability?
                    What are the opportunities for re-use and for developing research materials that
                    can be re-configured in a variety of ways?</p><p>We therefore need not only to accumulate evidence of value, but to think more
                    about the criteria and methods we should use for doing so. For instance, where
                    an analytical method is based on the methods used in other disciplines, e.g.
                    statistics, there may be methods of assessment that can be likewise borrowed.
                    Many of us believe the evidence is there, but we do not have the range of
                    coherent, agreed and tested methods of assessment that will enable us to make
                    assertions of value that will be reliable and will carry weight.</p><p>The panel session will seek to identify the range and kinds of evidence that
                    exists, the methods of assessment that are needed, and the methods of re-use and
                    reconfiguration that can give assurances of value.</p></div0><div0><head>Contributors:</head><p><emph rend="bold">David Robey </emph> (convenor): Introduction </p><lb/><p><emph rend="bold">Harold Short</emph> : Examples and case studies</p><lb/><p><emph rend="bold">Thornton Staples</emph> : Design and management for flexible use</p><lb/><p><emph rend="bold">Geoffrey Rockwell</emph> : Text analysis </p><lb/><p><emph rend="bold">Sheila Anderson</emph> : e-Science</p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
