                    digital edition of <title level="m">De Trein der Traagheid</title>, a novella by
                    the 20th century Flemish author Johan Daisne. The project initially aimed at a
                    print reading edition, involving the constitution of a reading text based on a
                    text-critical analysis of 19 witnesses of the novella's print history. However
                    absent from the original project proposal, the TEI markup scheme was adopted
                    early in the project as the means for digitally representing the edition. Its
                    provisions for marking up textual variation with the so-called
                    parallel-segmentation method informed the construction of a single XML source
                    text containing the transcriptions of all 19 text witnesses under consideration
                    as well as the constituted reading text, records of their mutual textual
                    variation, and editorial annotations. The subsequent development of the
                    electronic edition proved this unitary source text's potential for modelling a
                    microcosm of user-generated editions. This paper will focus on characteristics,
                    difficulties, and theoretical challenges of this particular editorial
                    constellation, as well as the tools developed for probing into it. </p></div0><div0><head>Modelling</head><p>Refocusing the goal towards an electronic edition added an experimental dimension
                    to the project. The lack of well-established models for (creating) electronic
                    scholarly editions forced us to conceptualise the boundaries of this particular
                    electronic edition in the course of its development. Initially, traditional
                    notions of scholarly editing (explicitly formalised as 'a print reading edition'
                    in the initial project proposal) provided a good starting point for the
                    development process. At first, development was guided by mimicking the familiar
                    print edition model, aimed at generating a reading text with apparatus variorum
                    from the XML source text. However, this denotative model <emph>of</emph> the
                    print edition (McCarty, 2004) soon evolved to a guiding principle itself for
                    conceptualising new ideas, an exemplary model <emph>for</emph> electronic
                    editions. The added potential of an interactive edition framework allowing for
                    user-driven input opened up new ways of exploring possible engagements of the
                    user with the textual tradition. On a theoretical level, this exemplary model
                    for electronic scholarly editions informed some challenging insights and
                    rethinking of the nature of this model's object (the edition). </p></div0><div0><head>Technology and tools</head><p>On the most basic level, the seminal potential of the XML source text for our
                    edition could be realised through the use of several open source XML-related
                    technologies and tools that are currently being adopted as a standard amalgam
                    for accessing XML resources. Key technologies for deploying XML texts like the
                    Extensible Stylesheet Transformation Language (XSLT) and XML Query language
                    (XQuery) allow for flexible manipulation and retrieval of XML encoded
                    information, commonly achieved through dedicated XSLT and XQuery processors, and
                    native XML databases.The advent of XML publishing environments like the Cocoon
                    web development framework has made it possible to integrate these
                    functionalities in dynamic user interfaces for presenting and querying XML
                    content via easily accessible delivery technologies such as a web browser. This
                    integrative potential stimulated the development of our XML text processing
                    scripts initially developed as a tentative instrument for a specific task, to
                    what we named the 'Morkel system', a generalisable suite of XSLT and XQuery
                    scripts for driving electronic scholarly editions in an open source software
                    environment.</p></div0><div0><head>Views on textual tradition</head><p>In the course of its experimental development the Morkel system became a tool
                    facilitating a multi-faceted user-driven view on the textual tradition captured
                    in the unitary XML source text.The scope of this view can be adjusted from
                    micro- to macro-level. Users can have access to singular texts in the tradition,
                    by requesting specific versions of the text as orientation version which
                    presents itself as a faithful reconstruction of this text version. A broader
                    view on the tradition can be accomplished by selecting a parallel edition, in
                    which different episodes in the textual tradition can be viewed and contrasted,
                    literally next to each other. This parallel presentation mode of different text
                    versions for visual comparison resembles that of the <emph>Versioning
                    Machine</emph>, developed by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
                    Humanities. Finally, the entire textual tradition can be taken into account when
                    a variorum edition is selected. In its ability to compare any number of text
                    versions with an orientation version, this variorum edition is similar to the
                        <emph>Juxta</emph> tool, developed by the Applied Research in Patacriticism
                    group at the University of Virginia. The focal point of this text comparison in
                    the Morkel system is the contextual external apparatus variorum containing only
                    the relevant variants for the selected comparison set and providing a locus for
                    reorienting the edition. This scope on the textual tradition can be further
                    refined on an intra-textual level. Complete text versions can be compared, as
                    well as separate text divisions (one of the 33 chapters or the dedication).
                    Where applicable when comparing different text versions, an entry to a generated
                    apparatus is provided both at chapter level and at paragraph level. </p></div0><div0><head>Edition formats</head><p>One end of the delivery spectrum features the dynamic XHTML visualisation
                    discussed so far. The versatility of XML equally allows for the generation of a
                    PDF visualisation of the (different) edition(s), closely resembling a
                    traditional print view of the textual tradition. A PDF rendering consists of an
                    orientation version, either as an integral text or as a chapter sample, possibly
                    compared to any number of comparison versions, as reflected in an inline
                    contextualised apparatus variorum. However dynamic this generative edition frame
                    is (Vanhoutte &amp; Van den Branden, forthcoming), its boundaries are still
                    present. To cater for this limitation and to enhance scientific independence,
                    the other extreme of the delivery range is offered as well: the Morkel system
                    equally allows users to generate pure XML renderings of the selected comparison
                    version texts or chapters, containing their parallel-segmented inline record of
                    the textual variation. These source texts can then be used in completely
                    different usage scenarios, perhaps featuring completely different software
                    environments.</p></div0><div0><head>Challenges</head><p>In short, the Morkel system enables users to generate their own edition(s) along
                    3 axes (comparison set (19 text witnesses and 1 reading text), textual scope
                    (all or 1 of the 34 text divisions), delivery format (3 possible formats)),
                    combining to 58 different visualisation parameters. This generates the potential
                    for 53.477.376 different views on the text, and problematises some traditional
                    text theoretical concepts, as well as the defining role of tools for the
                    electronic editions they facilitate or constitute. An obvious consequence of
                    this generative edition paradigm (Vanhoutte &amp; Van den Branden,
                    forthcoming) is the promotion of each text witness to a candidate orientation
                    version, instead of the adoption of one text version as a base text for the
                    edition against which all other versions are calibrated. Instead, this
                    calibration itself is made relative by the possibility of restoring each
                    different textual witness as an autonomous landmark in the textual tradition,
                    thence allowing a forward or backward look into the tradition. As a matter of
                    fact, the constituted reading text itself has become integrated as 'just' a
                    (commented) view on the textual tradition, against which all variant versions of
                    the text can be plotted. A dynamic selection of a comparison set not only
                    transforms the apparatus variorum to a dynamic, contextualised rendering of the
                    relevant textual variation, but equally promotes it to a performative instrument
                    for reorienting the edition to another point in the textual history. Due to the
                    dynamic selection of comparison sets, the notion of variable classification
                    becomes relativised. Discerning different types of textual variants becomes
                    irrelevant: a variant can hold as a spelling variant in one comparison set but
                    can change classes and become a semantic variant when compared to another
                    version in the textual tradition. The search capabilities of the Morkel system
                    even extend the view on the textual tradition from text level, by allowing
                    simple search operations inside one text version (intra-textual), to collection
                    level, by allowing complex search operations over different text versions
                    (extra-textual). To conclude, this generative paradigm for electronic scholarly
                    editions seems to articulate the defining role of the specific tools for
                    accessing electronic texts more sharply. On its own, the XML representation of
                    text-critical research is a valuable record of scientific labour, but it is the
                    specific (generative) interface which instantiates it as an editorial microcosm
                    by providing a range of user-driven access methods that enable dynamic
                    exploration of a textual tradition. The characteristics and exact nature of this
                    user-driven scholarly edition or constellation of editions is strongly
                    determined by the boundaries this generative interface provides, allowing for a
                    microscopic, telescopic, stereoscopic, or kaleidoscopic view on the textual
                    tradition.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="McCarty, Willard">Willard McCarty</name></author><title level="a">Modeling: A Study in Words and Meanings</title></analytic><monogr><editor role="editor"><name reg="Schreibman, Susan">Susan Schreibman</name></editor><editor role="editor"><name reg="Siemens, Ray">Ray Siemens</name></editor><editor role="editor"><name reg="Unsworth, John">John Unsworth</name></editor><title level="m">A Companion to the Digital Humanities</title><imprint><pubPlace>Oxford</pubPlace><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><date value="2004">2004</date><biblScope type="pages">254-70</biblScope></imprint></monogr></biblStruct><biblStruct><monogr><title level="m"><name reg="Juxta">Juxta</name></title><imprint/></monogr><note><xptr to="http://www.patacriticism.org/juxta/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/></note></biblStruct><biblStruct><monogr><title level="m">TEI P4: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
