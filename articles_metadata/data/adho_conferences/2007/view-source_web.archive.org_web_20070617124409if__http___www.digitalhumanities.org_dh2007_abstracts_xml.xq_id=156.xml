                    into TEI documents information about the world rather than information
                    concerning the text of the document to be encoded only. We see examples of this
                    through recent additions to the TEI standard, e.g. the person element (TEI P5,
                    sec. 20.4.2), as well as through the work in the Ontologies SIG since it was
                    established in 2004 (TEI Ontology SIG WIKI). In the SIG, the topic of discussion
                    is how to organise this kind of information about the world according to
                    specific ontologies.</p><p>One particularly promising ontology in this context is the CRM (CIDOC 2003). It
                    has been used together with Topic Maps to organize information from TEI
                    documents (Tuohy 2006) and as an attempt to find a solution to the so-called
                    exhibition problem (Eide 2006). Further, attempts have been made to formalise a
                    way to connect TEI and CRM documents (Ore 2006).</p><p>In this paper, we propose a method for automatic generation of CRM conforming
                    models based on TEI documents. We will discuss limitations to this approach, as
                    well as ways these may be overcome.</p></div0><div0><head>Our proposed method</head><p>The method we propose will include two important steps that should be possible to
                    implement to any given TEI document: Mapping and model building.</p><div1><head><emph>Mapping</emph></head><p>A mapping from the TEI document into a model conforming with CRM should be
                        created. It will be based on a general mapping of TEI elements to CRM we are
                        currently developing. But in TEI, many elements are defined quite loose, and
                        depending on the way they are used, they may be modelled differently in CRM.
                        According to the TEI guidelines, tag usage may be described in the TEI
                        header. Such descriptions may help to decide which type of modelling is the
                        most appropriate.</p><p>Ideally, such a specific mapping should be created based on an automatic
                        reading of the TEI header. But an element description in a <emph rend="bold">tagUsage</emph> element in the TEI header is in prose and will
                        generally not be stringent enough to be understood by an automatic reading
                        (TEI P5, sec. 5.3.4). Human interaction will be needed. It may be the case
                        that use of the <emph rend="bold">equiv</emph> element will make automatic
                        creation of mappings possible, as a reference to a certain CRM class may be
                        included as an external link (ibid, sec. 6.3.4).</p></div1><div1><head><emph>Model building</emph></head><p>A CRM conforming model based on the TEI document and populated with all
                        instances of mapped elements should then be created. This model may be used
                        as a query or a data mining system where the user looks for interesting
                        structures in the CRM conforming model alone, as well as in combination with
                        textual information collected from the TEI source document. But this model
                        may also be used in connection with other CRM conforming models, such as
                        museum databases. The connections will be based on regional or global object
                        identification, such as authority lists of names and classification schema.
                        The resulting "super model" may then be used as a data mining tool based on
                        semantic integration between heterogeneous resources.</p></div1></div0><div0><head>An example of a TEI input document</head><p>We are currently developing the building blocks for a system based on the method
                    described above. The example text used in our work is taken from a manuscript
                    describing examinations about geographical matters performed as court interviews
                    in 1740s, printed in the 1960s (Schnitler 1962). The printed edition was
                    digitised and marked up in a typical TEI way, with names of places and people as
                    well as dates tagged. A short paragraph of this tagged version, based on page 73
                    in the printed book, is translated to English and included below.</p><p>&lt;p xml:id="s1_24449"&gt; Answ: Named 
                        &lt;name type="person" xml:id="s1_24454"&gt; Ole
                        Nilsen&lt;/name&gt;, is born in &lt;name type="place"
                        xml:id="s1_24457"&gt; Tydals &lt;/name&gt; mountains, Which is
                        in<lb/> &lt;name type="place"
                        xml:id="s1_24460"&gt; Norway &lt;/name&gt;, of Sami parents, is 50
                        years old, married, and having one child; has mostly dwelled in
                        &lt;name type="place"
                        xml:id="s1_24466" &gt; Tydals &lt;/name&gt; mountains, and now
                        dwelling in the Norwegian &lt;name type="place"
                        xml:id="s1_24469"&gt; Mærragers &lt;/name&gt; mountains.
                        &lt;/p&gt; 
                </p><div1><head><emph>What is tagged — and what is not</emph></head><p>Names and dates are tagged in our document. This means that many references
                        to persons, places and times are included. But there are a lot of other
                        references to similar real world entities that are not tagged, e.g. when
                        words other than proper names are used to refer to them. In the example
                        above, "one child" is not tagged, whereas other references to the same
                        historical person in terms of his or her name are tagged as person names.
                        Furthermore, events are not tagged in this text. Thus, whereas the name of a
                        boy who is born and the place of his birth is tagged, the event connecting
                        these together, i.e. the birth, is not marked up.</p><p>This is common to most TEI documents, and is based on the text centric
                        tradition of the TEI community. There were good reasons why this tradition
                        was established, but it may be the case that for some types of documents,
                        textual references to e.g. events should be marked up.</p><p>A simple CRM model of parts of the paragraph above is included as Figure 1.
                        The solid lines represent what can be directly read from XML elements in the
                        TEI document, whereas the dotted lines shows the parts not based on the TEI
                        markup. This shows that the information needed to model the connection
                        between the person and the mountain - that he was born there - is not tagged
                        in the TEI document.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_156_eide_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1</figDesc></figure></div1><div1><head><emph>How to find the events</emph></head><p>As the models created through the use of our proposed method is based on the
                        XML tags alone, important information in the text is not considered when the
                        model is created. Several possible ways to improve this exist. One is
                        automatic event detection, as used e.g. in the Perseus project (Smith 2002).
                        The use of this method too causes some problems. One problem is that fact
                        that even if the system works quite good for English material, considerable
                        work remains to be done to create a similar tool for 18th century Danish,
                        even though the method is implemented also for smaller languages such as
                        Finnish (Makkonen 2003). Named entity recognition systems are developed for
                        modern Danish (Johannessen 2004), but this is of no use in the common
                        situation where names are already tagged in the documents. Another problem
                        is the fact that these kinds of methods will always be imperfect, resulting
                        in either missed events, false positives, or both of these.</p><p>Another way to solve the problem would be to reread the text, identifying
                        events and tagging them. This would be a reliable method, but
                        time-consuming. Even a combination of these strategies, a semi automatic
                        method, would mean quite a lot of work.</p><p>A possible way to solve the problem of event identification is to use the
                        model. Any person or place in the CRM model has a link to the name of the
                        person or place, an from the name in the CRM model to the TEI name element.
                        This means that the textual distance to other person name elements, place
                        name elements and date elements can be calculated. Further, it is possible
                        to locate all words within a certain distance, and all words between two
                        names.</p><p>This is similar to the first approach above. But in addition, we propose to
                        connect the CRM model to external databases. An example of this would be if
                        we have a CRM version of a database based on church book records. In this
                        church book based CRM model a person may be found with a name similar to Ole
                        Nilsen, a birth date in a possible range for being a witness in 1742, and a
                        birth place with a name similar to a place name mentioned in the text in
                        connection to the person's name. This external source may then help us to
                        include the E67 Birth event in our model. This may turn out to be impossible
                        without manual work, but we hope at least to make the manual work more
                        effective.</p></div1></div0><div0><head>Conclusion</head><p>A general observation from our work is that the more relevant information types
                    is marked up in a TEI document, the easier it is to use automatic methods to
                    generate CRM conforming models. But even a limited tagging with only names and
                    dates marked up do help. We will continue our work on the implementation of a
                    system based on the method described in this abstract. We believe this will
                    improve the usability of TEI documents as information sources as well as
                    simplifying the process of adding more information, such as event elements, into
                    such documents.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="CIDOC">CIDOC</name></author><title level="a">Definition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model</title><respStmt><resp>Produced by</resp><name>the ICOM/CIDOC Documentation Standards Group</name></respStmt><respStmt><resp>continued by</resp><name>the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group</name></respStmt></analytic><monogr><title level="u">ISO/DIS 21127</title><imprint><date value="2003">2003</date></imprint></monogr><note><xptr crdate="2006-11-13" to="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/deﬁnition_cidoc.html" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/></note></biblStruct><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Eide, Øyvind">Øyvind Eide</name></author><title level="a">The Exhibition Problem.
