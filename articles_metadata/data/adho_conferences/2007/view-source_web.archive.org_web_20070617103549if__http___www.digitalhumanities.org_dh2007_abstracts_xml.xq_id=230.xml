                    work of Brown University's Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice, which in
                    2003 was formed to investigate the university's historical relationship to
                    slavery and the slave trade. The committee's research included working with
                    archival materials from the John Carter Brown Library and the John Hay Library
                    at Brown University. A significant subset of these materials concerned a single
                    slave voyage conducted by John and Nicholas Brown in the 1760s, for which a
                    large amount of documentary evidence survives, including ship's manifests,
                    invoices and receipts, letters, bills of lading, and the captain's trade book.
                    The Brown University Scholarly Technology Group (STG) worked with Professor
                    James Campbell, chair of the committee, and Patrick Yott, director of the Center
                    for Digital Initiatives, to develop a resource through which these documents
                    could be read and explored.</p><p>The goal of the project was to present these materials in a digital form that
                    would respond to the committee's expressed goal to "help the campus and the
                    nation reflect on the meaning of this history in the present, on the complex
                    historical, political, legal, and moral questions posed by any present-day
                    confrontation with past injustice." The project thus presented a number of
                    challenges: the breadth of audience, the need to engage readers with widely
                    varying levels of familiarity with the historical background, and the need to
                    offer as many ways as possible of engaging with and probing these materials, so
                    that they would yield the maximum possible insight into the social, political,
                    historical, cultural, and economic circumstances surrounding the slave trade.
                    The initial version of the site, which was released concurrently with the
                    committee's report, emphasizes access to the primary source documents through
                    page images and TEI transcriptions. The second phase of the project's
                    development, which will be completed by the end of 2007, will provide more
                    detailed forms of access through specialized interface tools that draw on
                    additional contextual data being developed by the project faculty.</p><p>This poster and demonstration focuses on three areas of particular significance
                    arising from this project:<list type="ordered"><item>The interface design, which emphasized ways of
                            engaging readers of all skill and education levels and providing them
                            with contextual information needed to interact meaningfully with the
                            primary source documents</item><item>The management of interconnections between TEI
                            transcriptions, metadata, images, and contextual data, which support a
                            set of exploratory tools.</item><item>The exploratory tools themselves, which encourage
                            readers to probe the historical sources and their context in ways that
                            go beyond the authoritative information provided by the site
                        itself.</item></list></p></div0><div0><head>Interface design</head><p>One of the central premises guiding the project's design was the fact that we
                    were anticipating readers in two broad categories: those familiar with the
                    historical context who would be immediately interested in exploring the primary
                    source documents and able to make some sense of them, and those coming to the
                    site with no prior knowledge, who might have no initial interest in the
                    documents at all and no way of exploring them meaningfully. Readers in the
                    former group would need powerful tools to allow them to probe the documents,
                    while those in the latter group would need a more narrative interface
                    emphasizing the historical context and its modern significance, and providing
                    readers with a sense of why the primary source documents constitute an important
                    intellectual resource. The interface is designed with the aim of leading all
                    readers, eventually, to the documents via links from the historical narrative to
                    the relevant documentary material, but it also provides readers with search and
                    exploration tools that embody as much contextual information as possible:
                    glossed timelines and maps, social networks of people, and lists of commodities
                    involved in the slave trade, all drawn from the information carried in the
                    primary source documents themselves.</p></div0><div0><head>Data Structures</head><p>The documents and contextual information are represented through a set of
                    interrelated data structures, specifically:<list type="unordered"><item>TEI transcriptions of the primary source documents</item><item>digital images of each document at a variety of resolutions</item><item>METS records representing the structure of each digital object</item><item>a set of simple XML data structures to represent four categories of
                            contextual information on persons, places, events, and commodities named
                            in the texts, to allow for glosses and information about the
                            interconnections between items in these groups (such as social networks,
                            family relationships, classifications of commodities, and so forth). The
                            TEI transcriptions capture a comparatively large amount of information
                            about the documents' content, by encoding all references to persons,
                            places, commodities, and financial transactions so that these can be
                            indexed, glossed, regularized, and searched. The transcriptions use this
                            encoding to reference the contextual information, using key= attributes
                            which point to the relevant records describing the person, place, event,
                            or commodity in question. This allows both for basic hooks to allow (for
                            instance) links to glosses directly from the text, and also for more
                            advanced exploratory tools which process this information and represent
                            it through visualizations and advanced search mechanisms.</item></list></p></div0><div0><head>Exploratory tools</head><p>The primary source documents for the Sally project are often individually
                    compelling, but they are most significant when understood as part of a social
                    and economic network. The existence of this network, however, can only be
                    grasped indirectly and fragmentarily through the documents themselves; the
                    reader needs tools for exploration that allow patterns and connections to become
                    visible, and that can draw on the contextual information provided. When
                    completed the project will include a set of interface tools that facilitate
                    precisely this kind of exploration. For instance, the reader will be able to
                    explore the network of people and social relations that surround the Sally
                    voyage and inhabit its documentary record--owners, captain, seamen, outfitters,
                    workmen, employees, enslaved Africans, slave traders. Their documentary
                    relationships (for instance, the senders and receivers of letters and invoices)
                    will be visible along with all of the metadata about those exchanges (place and
                    date of writing, type of document, etc.) so that readers can construct a
                    detailed and vivid picture of the vectors of communication through which this
                    voyage is documented. Similarly detailed information supports the exploration of
                    the commodities described in these documents, both those that were explicitly
                    traded for slaves (rum, cloth, iron bars), and those that were structurally
                    essential to the trade (weapons, sugar, the ship's provisions). Visualization
                    tools such as word clouds, manipulable representations of networks, and
                    generated timelines will give readers a variety of ways to explore this
                    information in ways that allow an overall grasp of the landscape as well as
                    direct connections to the documentary evidence at every point.</p></div0><div0><head>Conclusions</head><p>Because the collection of documents associated with the Sally voyage is
                    comparatively small (on the order of a hundred or so), the greatest
                    informational value was to be gained by an emphasis on detail (through the
                    encoding of the transcriptions) and on contextual information (through the
                    associated XML data structures that represent ontological relationships between
                    the various persons, commodities, and so forth). This kind of approach is
                    uncommon for collections of historical documents, which characteristically
                    emphasize scale (consider for instance the Valley of the Shadow, or the Making
                    of America projects). Using visualization tools to model and interact with
                    information of this type is also comparatively rare; visualization tools are
                    being increasingly used for exploration of very large data sets (often not
                    encoded in XML at all) but are less common for small, heavily tagged document
                    collections. This project thus offers opportunities for an exploration of
                    digital methods which may yield some useful results at its conclusion--in
                    particular, on the question of how much value is added by detailed markup and
                    tools that exploit it.</p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
