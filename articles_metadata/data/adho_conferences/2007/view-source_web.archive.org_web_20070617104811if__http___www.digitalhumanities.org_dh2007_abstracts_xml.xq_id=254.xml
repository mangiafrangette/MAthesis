                    more than a decade, often in the form of proprietary virtual worlds built for
                    select audiences such as teachers and students. Since launching in 2003, the
                    online virtual community of Second Life (<xptr to="http://www.secondlife.com" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) has attracted over one million dedicated
                    'residents' who are laying the foundations for widespread adoption of MUVE. In
                    many ways, the growth of MUVE mirrors the growth of the Web. New technologies
                    transition from small scale prototypes constructed by researchers at great
                    expense to large scale, rapidly growing mainstream products and services
                    available to the general public. These products are not only used by many
                    people, but are co-created by them. With the Web this was a matter of using
                    hypertext to create websites, initially inspired by various genres of print
                    media, and soon evolving their own genres. In the case of MUVE like Second Life
                    (SL), residents can create 3D artifacts, buildings, and social spaces where
                    people interact. The social nature of Second Life is a critical component of
                    understanding how it is, can, and should be used. </p><p>Already we can see a wide range of museum-like activities occurring in Second
                    Life. A recent survey identified over 150 museums, galleries or museum-like
                    activity spaces in Second Life. These museums offered visitors opportunities to
                    view collections of real-life and fictional spacecraft, digitized versions of
                    real-life artworks, exhibitions of artworks created in Second Life, living
                    history reenactments, or archaeological monuments (Urban, Marty &amp;
                    Twidale, 2007). Reflecting the patterns of development of the early World Wide
                    Web, most of these SL museum spaces have been created by enthusiasts - residents
                    who are not affiliated with real-life museums.</p><p>Game studies researchers have suggested that the behaviors of players in other
                    massively multi-player online games (MMOG) such as <emph>World of
                    Warcraft</emph> are blurring the boundaries between work, play and learning
                    (Castronova, 2006; Steinkuehler &amp; Williams, 2006; Yee, 2006). Like other
                    passionate user communities, Second Life residents are turning the virtual world
                    into a 'third place' where they can engage in serious leisure pursuits. Museums
                    and cultural heritage institutions are not unfamiliar with serious leisure as
                    they often engage with amateur archaeologists, natural scientists,
                    living-history re-enactors or family historians. Unlike traditional museum
                    audiences, these individuals are "involved participants rather than consumers"
                    (Orr, 2006; Stebbins, 1992).</p><p>The degree to which individual residents decide to place themselves on a
                    continuum from pure work to pure play can affect the results of their activities
                    in Second Life. Some residents seek to evoke a particular historic place, while
                    others engage in the serious work of conducting research, visiting the real-life
                    places and artifacts upon which their Second Life representations are based.
                    Some residents see Second Life as primarily a social space that requires a lower
                    degree of authenticity and accuracy. As long as the stage can provide the
                    necessary background, it can facilitate social interactions (DiBlas, 2005).
                    Other residents are using Second Life as a new expressive medium that allows
                    them to create new artworks or to accurately represent cultural artifacts as
                    best they can.</p><p>As residents create museum-like activities, humanities scholars are exploring
                    Second Life as a virtual classroom. The New Media Consortium (<xptr to="http://www.nmc.org/sl/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) has constructed a
                    virtual campus where classes are held in "outdoor" amphitheaters, faculty and
                    students are staging plays, poetry readings and providing space for digital
                    artists to create new works. The Stanford Humanities Lab (<xptr to="http://shl.stanford.edu/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), the Humanities,
                    Arts, Science and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC - <xptr to="http://www.hastac.org/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) have also staked
                    some ground in Second Life. </p><p>Observations of how Second Life residents are currently engaging in serious
                    leisure activities around museums and archaeological models can inform many
                    kinds of research. We can study the early stages of a new online social medium
                    being co-created and evolving into a new form, just as the early days of the web
                    led to the development of new forms of creating, sharing and manipulating
                    information, including cultural materials. We can also use the work of these
                    technological pioneers to inform ways to create new learning spaces for
                    students. Second Life also affords researchers and students an opportunity to
                    demonstrate what is possible when more rigorous methods are applied. While many
                    projects have created models using highly accurate rendering systems, Second
                    Life can add value to this work by providing tools for social engagement for a
                    broader audience (Di Blas, 2003, 2005; Eiteljorg, 2004). The serious leisure
                    activities of Second Life residents also suggest a more open and inquiry based
                    approach to learning. Instead of presenting students with already completed
                    models, Second Life can engage students through co-creation and collaborative
                    discovery.</p><p>This poster will present examples of museum-like spaces and activities taking
                    place in Second Life with a particular focus on archeological-themed
                    representations. It will illustrate how Second Life museums are largely the
                    product of resident’s serious leisure activities. Using these activities as an
                    example of what is possible it will explore how early attempts at teaching in
                    Second Life might be informed by resident’s serious leisure activities.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_254_urban_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1: Themiskyra Throne Room<lb/><xptr to="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Themiskyra/81/241/21/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/></figDesc></figure></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><monogr><author><name reg="Castronova, Edward">Edward Castronova</name></author><title level="m">Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online
