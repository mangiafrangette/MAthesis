                    Conference in Tübingen. It is a software tool for displaying and comparing
                    multiple versions of texts designed by a team of programmers, designers, and
                    literary scholars. A primary goal of the software was to create a display
                    environment which provides for features traditionally found in codex-based
                    critical editions – such as annotation and introductory material – that also
                    takes advantage of opportunities offered by editing and displaying witnesses in
                    an electronic environment.</p><p>The VM was designed as open source software that would allow literary editors to
                    concentrate on editing and displaying multiple versions of text using the Text
                    Encoding Initiative (TEI), rather than expecting them to build a custom
                    environment. The developers deliberately built the tool with JavaScript, CSS,
                    and XSLT, as these technologies are presumably within the reach of a humanities
                    scholar if she wanted to alter the environment.</p><p><emph>The Versioning Machine</emph> is now in its third iteration, and has been
                    demoed at various humanities computing conferences over the years. This poster
                    session will not focus on the VM as a tool per se, but will focus on the issues
                    and lessons learned developing open source software for the humanities. As this
                    tool was developed for a very specific goal for a potentially small community of
                    users, this poster will focus on the issues raised by developing software for an
                    emerging practice, the difficulties posed by changing technologies, and the
                    issues raised by moving from fairly standard book-based presentation paradigms
                    for scholarly editions, to the relative vacuum of agreed-upon conventions for
                    web-based editions </p></div0><div0><head>Developing Software for an Emerging Practice</head><p>At any gathering of digital humanists, there is a plea for software designed
                    specifically for humanities applications. <emph>The Versioning Machine</emph>
                    was developed to fill a fairly narrow niche. As such, its development has had as
                    a central focus the exploration of the possibilities, as well as the
                    limitations, of electronic editions that focus on the presentation of multiple
                    witnesses.</p><p>For the first time in the software's development, rigorous and methodical
                    usability testing will be carried out by a team member not directly concerned
                    with software development. This testing will not only assess user-friendliness,
                    accessibility, performance, and overall structure, but will also investigate the
                    larger issue of whether <emph>The Versioning Machine</emph> functions as an
                    asset to the community of scholars it is meant to serve. The test participants
                    will be comprised of 10-15 literary scholars and textual editors. They will be
                    given a series of tasks to perform and will be asked to comment on what they are
                    doing or trying to do. They will also be asked to comment on the overall
                    difficulty or ease of use, as well as the degree to which <emph>The Versioning
                        Machine</emph> has or could enhance their scholarship. Because many of the
                    participants will not be on-site, a web-based survey will be used to capture
                    their impressions. Additionally, a number of participants will be tested on site
                    so that our observations can be compared with the self-reported experiences. The
                    resulting findings will be used as a framework to make further changes to the
                    software. </p></div0><div0><head>Difficulties Posed by Changing Technologies</head><p>Persistent issues frequently faced in web-based open source tools development
                    include shifting platforms, technologies, and standards on which software is
                    constructed; personnel changes within the development team; and finding enough
                    time to not only do software development, but create the documentation and
                    procedures which allow others access. The difficulties of attempting to adhere
                    to standards, while ensuring cross-browser compatibility, is one issue that will
                    be addressed in the poster as representative of these issues.</p><p>During the early stages of the tool's development, it was not possible to
                    replicate the functionality available for browsers on the PC on the Mac OS
                    operating systems. It was decided to go live with limited browser support rather
                    delay the software further. By 2.0, many of the compatibility issues had been
                    worked out, with support for Mozilla-based browsers and Apple's Safari. 3.0
                    focused both on expanding features of <emph>The Versioning Machine</emph> as
                    well as addressing several major compatibility issues. This involved a
                    significant reworking of both the XSLT stylesheet and the CSS style rules that
                    power the tool. Earlier versions were lacking in compliance with W3C standards,
                    which accounted for a large part of the cross-browser compatibility issues. A
                    change in personnel meant that several of the people involved in versions 1.0
                    and 2.0 were no longer on the project team. A lack of both comprehensive
                    documentation and time ensured that, even in its current form, <emph>The
                        Versioning Machine</emph> would not correctly validate as
                    standards-compliant. Thus a pragmatic approach was adopted in which the most
                    obvious discrepancies were addressed, while ensuring that all new additions were
                    coded with respect to the relevant W3C standards. </p><p>Of the newly added features, the most significant was the introduction of
                    optional line numbering, drawn from the TEI markup of the document. This proved
                    one of the more difficult features to implement, in large part because of the
                    different ways that various browsers implement CSS. A presentation that looked
                    acceptable in Internet Explorer, for example, did not look acceptable in Firefox
                    or Safari. Toggling line numbers on and off presented another problem. In this
                    case, the JavaScript required worked differently on all three browsers. This was
                    one example of a problem that strict adherence to W3C standards could not solve.
                    There was more than one standards-compliant way of achieving similar
                    functionality, but the difficulty was in finding one method that worked
                    consistently across multiple platforms.</p><p>The ability to directly modify the version 2.0 source code certainly expedited
                    the design process for version 3.0. On the other hand, it also meant that we
                    were forced to address many of the shortcomings of the earlier version as well.
                    Thankfully, Amit Kumar, who had worked with the earlier version and implemented
                    the majority of the version 3.0 changes, was able to provide insight into the
                    workings of the application, and to bring his experience working with it to bear
                    on the new compatibility challenges.</p><p>As part of the 3.0 redevelopment, a thorough re-evaluation of the interface was
                    undertaken which would move it toward a more finished, professional look. A
                    common pitfall of interface design is that the person designing the interface is
                    often so familiar with the product that they are unable to view it from a new
                    user’s perspective. Bringing in a new designer for release 3.0 meant not only a
                    fresh approach to the visual side, but also a new set of eyes completely
                    unfamiliar with <emph>The Versioning Machine</emph>.</p><p>Other than the addition of a “backup” menu to the footer, the interface elements
                    of 3.0 are not significantly different from release 2.0 — however, their
                    arrangement has been streamlined for better usability. Even those changes that
                    appear purely cosmetic have a level of thought behind them. For example, the
                    text in the upper left that said “Versioning Machine” now spells out the release
                    version of the software. To the left of that a tagline (“A Tool for Displaying
                    &amp; Comparing Different Versions of Literary Texts”) has been added to
                    spell out in broad strokes the software's intended purpose.</p></div0><div0><head>What Does an Electronic Scholarly Edition Look Like?</head><p>Lastly, this poster will address some of the theoretical issues that the
                    developers of <emph>The Versioning Machine</emph> have faced in designing an environment to
                    present a web-based scholarly edition. There is today, ten years after the
                    development of the World Wide Web, little consensus within the editing community
                    about the features and standards that should be required, or at least desired,
                    in these editions. The user testing on <emph>The Versioning Machine</emph> to be presented at
                    <emph>Digital Humanities 2007</emph>, the ongoing development of the software to keep apace
                    with standards, and changing user expectations, will contribute a small piece to
                    that dialogue.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><monogr><title level="m"><name reg="Better Desktop">Better Desktop</name></title><imprint/></monogr><note><xptr crdate="2006-11-12" to="http://www.betterdesktop.org" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/></note></biblStruct><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Burstein, Cari D.">Cari D.
