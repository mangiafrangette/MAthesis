Introduction</head><p>Computational music is a young discipline undergoing ever increasing development.
                    Most research conducted to date concerns digital audio, multimedia, automatic
                    composition, score writing, etc. A humanities-oriented approach (i.e.
                    musicological) is a more recent, less well-defined development, though it is
                    also growing.</p><p>The application of such studies regard, to mention only a few:<list type="unordered"><item>automatic extraction of statistics;</item><item>verification of grammar rules applied to music;</item><item>automatic application of models for formal and harmonic analysis;</item><item>validation of models for different analysis types.</item></list></p><p>The MIDI format is the technology most often used in computational music.
                    Developed in the early 1980s, MIDI is a digital representation of music, used
                    especially for communication between electronic musical instruments, including
                    computers. The MIDI message associates an integer number to each note (e.g.
                    central C is 60), so it is suitable to a wide range of studies.</p><p>A newer technology, MusicXML, offers the same possibilities and more, but
                    requires different techniques for data retrieval.</p><p>The following abstract presents the results of a statistical analysis of the
                    tenor parts of some operas by Giacomo Puccini, encoded in MusicXML for the
                    Research Institution “Centro Studi Giacomo Puccini” in Lucca, Italy.
                    Specifically, it examines the arias of Rodolfo from <emph>La Bohème</emph> and
                    Principe Calaf from <emph>Turandot.</emph></p><p>The encoding of these musical pieces was discussed in one of the author’s thesis
                    dissertation for his degree in Computer Science for the Humanities at the
                    University of Pisa, under the supervision of Professor Elena Pierazzo. The
                    dissertation deals with the possibilities for automatic applications illustrated
                    in section 4 herein.</p></div0><div0><head>2. What is MusicXML?</head><p>LLC is an American Internet music publishing and software company; it developed
                    and promoted the MusicXML encoding language, which can represent the music
                    notation system established in the West since the 17th Century.</p><p>MusicXML is a royalty-free format that implements all the features offered by XML
                    technology: <list type="unordered"><item>data structure</item><item>modularity</item><item>extensibilty</item><item>possibility of querying and interaction through XML family
                            technologies.</item></list></p><p>MusicXML is designed to represent a score in a digital format, so most of
                    information contained in a human-readable score is retrievable in the encoding
                    and can be used for various kinds of analyses. Features such as lyrics, author
                    or reviewer notes, dynamics, agogic indications, and so on, are encoded with
                    their position in the score.</p><p>An important part of the encoding is the Score Header, which contains metadata,
                    such as author, poet, work number, instruments, etc. An instrument data section
                    even enables specifying the MIDI instrument channel to be used to play the
                    music.</p></div0><div0><head>3. Automatic statistical extraction: an example application.</head><p>The encoded tenor parts have been inserted into eXist, an Open Source XML
                    database, to be queried with the XQuery language.</p><p>The goal was to extract statistical data with relevance to the humanities.
                    Indeed, such data was used for a musicological dissertation on vocalism in
                    Puccini’s works.</p><p>The statistics are based on the criteria proposed by Marco Gilardone and Franco
                    Fussi in <emph>Le voci di Puccini. Un’indagine sul canto</emph> (The Voices of
                    Puccini. An inquiry on singing). The statistics presented in such work were
                    extended and adapted to include the <emph>ossias</emph>.<note n="1">An
                            <emph>ossìa</emph> is an alternative way to execute part of a measure or
                        one or more measures.</note></p><p>The statistics are the percentage occurrences in the distribution of notes
                    according to the following classification of tones:</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_192_viglianti_0.jpg</xref></p><figDesc/></figure><p>The upper and lower limits are the extreme notes of the analyzed part; the
                    numbers beside to the notes denote the octave; the notes highlighted in grey are
                    transition tones, which are interesting due to their difficulty of execution
                    within the part.</p><p>The original statistics were extended to account for the incidence of dynamic
                    aspects such as <emph>piano, pianissimo, mezzoforte, forte</emph> in transition
                    tones and acute tones. </p><p>The XQuery query language was used, as it offers many possibilities for data
                    extraction from an XML database, though it is often redundant and does not
                    provide for complex structures such as arrays or the like.</p><p>Starting with the retrieved numerical data, a musicologist can construct a
                    dramatic character profile. For example, Calaf’s singing parts exhibit a high
                    percentage of acute tones (27.39%), transition tones (17.63%) and a high ratio
                    between acute and grave tones. This is a deliberate aesthetic choice, made to
                    portray a character in less realistic terms than other tenor roles, perhaps
                    because he is part of a fantastic drama; indeed, his vocality tends to be
                    heightened.</p><p>Rodolfo, instead, exhibits ‘milder’ musical behavior; he sings less transition
                    notes (10.37%), and those with dynamic indications are sung in piano. The middle
                    tones are greatly predominant (69.63%); Rodolfo is indeed a character who tends
                    to be more intimate, and displays less dramatic presence.</p><p>All the statistics are produced via a query, and each piece of information needed
                    for calculations is furnished directly from the encoded score.</p><p>Beginning with this model, many other searches may be carried out, such as
                    graphs or division of the notes in each act, etc. Deeper analysis with the model
                    provides for clearer delineation of a character’s profile.</p></div0><div0><head>4. Thematic extraction based on Retì’s musicological analysis</head><p>In the 1950s, Rudolf Retì developed a musicological analysis based on the
                    repetition of thematic cells. Such cells may occur in different ways and can be
                    found by considering the melodic interval.<note n="2">A melodic interval is the
                        tonal distance between two notes in sequence.</note></p><p>Consider, for example, the following sequence of notes:</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_192_viglianti_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1</figDesc></figure><p>Between C and E there is an interval of two tones, while E and D are separated by
                    only one tone. If the following sequence <figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_192_viglianti_2.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 2</figDesc></figure>occurs later on in the part, it can be compared to the sequence in
                    figure 1, because the intervals correspond: there is an interval of two tones
                    between G and B, and one tone between B and A.</p><p>Retì views entire compositions as based on a few thematic cells. The cell can
                    occur in the same sequence as the initial one or in a different sequence, that
                        is:<list type="unordered"><item>notes in inverse order</item><item>exchanged position of the notes</item><item>transposition to different notes, but with the same interval.</item></list></p><p>Any transformation of the cell can also occur with “interpolated” notes, which
                    are inserted between the principal notes.</p><p>Starting from the corpus encoded in the author’s dissertation for the Research
                    Institute Centro Puccini, an algorithm was envisioned for automatic retrieval of
                    the repercussions of such thematic cells.</p><p>Although such algorithm was implemented with XQuery, it proved unable to fulfill
                    the task, because of the lack of advanced structures in XQuery. The study is
                    still ongoing, as is the implementation of the algorithm in other programming
                    languages, in particular, Java or Perl.</p></div0><div0><head>5. Limits of MusicXML</head><p>Even if MusicXML offers many possibilities for research, not every prerequisite
                    of high level academic research can be satisfied: it is designed to be a
                    sufficient but not optimal representation of musical scores. For instance, with
                    MusicXML it is impossible to encode ossias, but for this research it was enough
                    to encode only one of the two options of the score. On the other hand , the
                    encoding model would not be optimal for a study that has as a goal to represent
                    a score exactly as it appears. Anyway MusicXML is extensible and many other
                    encoding models can be developed starting from the actual model. At this stage
                    it should be pointed out that there are other encoding models that are starting
                    to be used in the academic research, such as MEI (Music Encoding Initiative).
                    MEI is designed to represent with effectiveness also information about the
                    physical support and provides a more complex structure of metadata. Still the
                    weakness of MEI is the lack of plug-ins that can convert from score writing
                    software or from optical recognition programs. As a matter of fact, most
                    research based on MEI uses XSLT technology to convert from MusicXML to MEI. This
                    area of research is constantly evolving.</p></div0><div0><head>6. Conclusions</head><p>The abstract presents MusicXML as an alternative technology for conducting
                    automatic analysis of music, adopting a statistical approach. The potentials of
                    such techniques are considerable: in the future they are likely to be applied
                    for advanced research, such as pattern matching and automatic formal analysis,
                    or for added encoding, including commentaries, metadata for retrieval, harmonic
                    analyses, as well as for retrieval from digital collections of scores.</p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
