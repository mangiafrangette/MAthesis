                            does not deliberately go out to do that. My Ántonia, for instance, is

                    scholars, yet the results produced by those tools are rarely utilized in typical
                    literary and cultural criticism. Though the reasons for this disconnect are
                    varied, we believe two primary hurdles are visibility and accessibility.
                    Specifically, most text analysis tools and research are not found on the
                    sites—like thematic digital text archives—that scholars use most, and most text
                    analysis tools are not designed for ordinary scholars, but are meant for those
                    with more technical sophistication.</p><p> Our essay discusses a novel approach to filling this gap between scholars and
                    text analysis, an ongoing collaborative experiment in humanities computing to
                    bring a "new business" that willfully counters the "patterns which have proved
                    successful" in literary criticism in order to add a new dimension to literary
                    research. In "The Other Side of the Rug: TokenX on the <emph>Will Cather
                    Archive</emph>," we discuss the application of Brian Pytlik Zillig's text
                    analysis, visualization, and play tool, TokenX (<xptr to="http://tokenx.unl.edu" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) to the <emph>Willa Cather Archive</emph>
                        (<xptr to="http://cather.unl.edu" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), a free,
                    educational resource dedicated to the study of Willa Cather's life and writings
                    and edited by Andrew Jewell. When this application of TokenX debuts in the
                    summer of 2007, scholars will be able to analyze the entire corpus of Cather's
                    fiction, from her first college publications to her final short story. In many
                    ways, our project is in the tradition of research that seeks to use text
                    analysis tools to arrive at, in Ramsay and Steger's language, "suggestive
                    patterns" to "enable critical reflection in literary study." However, in
                    creating this tool for application on the <emph>Cather Archive</emph>, we were
                    faced with two distinct challenges: (1) how to develop TokenX to make it capable
                    of the envisioned crossdocument analysis which is sensitive to changes over
                    time, and (2) how to design an interface that would make sophisticated text
                    analysis a manageable, useful tool for the widest possible range of Cather
                    scholars, scholars unaccustomed to using such tools. </p><p>The project is a interdisciplinary collaboration between Pytlik Zillig, a Digital
                    Initiatives Librarian with specialization in XSLT and text analysis, and Jewell,
                    Assistant Professor of Digital Projects with a Ph.D. in American literature,
                    both of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Center for Digital Research in the
                    Humanities. The paper, likewise, is a collaborative work that represents two
                    distinct but complementary perspectives on the issue.</p><p>Pytlik Zillig asserts that, for digital humanities, the development and ready
                    availability of tools to assist in the noticing and appreciation of texts is of
                    increasing importance. Unsworth has observed that “by paying attention to an
                    object of interest, we can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice
                    things about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its value."
                    For the first iteration of the TokenX/Cather collaboration, the TokenX tool has
                    generated a word frequency data set containing nearly half a million data cells.
                    These data reveal the frequency of usage of words in fifteen TEI-encoded XML
                    texts, representing Cather’s complete corpus of book-length fiction. This data
                    set will be available for dynamic, user-centered queries to assist in
                    formulating theories and facilitating explorations of Cather’s changing diction
                    over time. (See Figure 1 for initial results on ten sample terms within Cather's
                    corpus, detailing her usage of certain "body" words within each of her published
                    books of fiction.) If a text’s common words are, as John Burrows suggests, "a
                    barely visible web that gives shape to whatever is being said" (323), then it
                    must be the ambition of tools such as TokenX to expose the dimensions of that
                    web for further inquiry. (Plans are underway to add TokenX to the Text Analysis
                    Portal for Research [TAPoR], which will enable TokenX users to visualize,
                    analyze and play with documents stored on the TAPoR portal.)</p><p>Jewell argues that introduction of and experimentation with new tools for
                    engagement with literary texts are an important way to make author-centric
                    sites, like the <emph>Willa Cather Archive</emph>, models of
                    innovation. The audience of the <emph>Cather Archive</emph> is
                    not one inherently inclined to think about literary texts numerically. The onus
                    on the designer, then, is to consider the sorts of research questions driving
                    Cather and American literature scholarship and to make this tool something that
                    would contribute to tackling such questions. For example, how might text
                    analysis contribute to a scholar exploring Cather's work with a cultural studies
                    or gender studies approach? What about a scholar looking at contexts, themes, or
                    references within a single novel, or the fiction of a finite span in Cather's
                    career? How might this tool aid a researcher interested in tracking evolutions
                    in Cather's prose over a long period of time? (See Lindemann and the program of
                    the 2005 International Cather Seminar for examples of these approaches). By
                    designing an interface that is sensitive to a range of scholarly inquiry, one
                    that allows for a significant amount of flexibility and user input, TokenX on
                    the <emph>Cather Archive</emph> can represent an innovative use
                    of digital research that is brought into the mainstream of scholarship. By
                    demonstrating sensitivity to researcher interests and seeking to design broadly
                    useful tools, we demonstrate to colleagues that such tools are not just for
                    specialists, but can enrich diverse arguments, any that find foundation— as most
                    literary scholarship does—on the use of words.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Burrows, John">John Burrows</name></author><title level="a">Textual Analysis</title></analytic><monogr><editor role="editor"><name reg="Schreibman, Susan">Susan Schreibman</name></editor><editor role="editor"><name reg="Siemens, Ray">Ray Siemens</name></editor><editor role="editor"><name reg="Unsworth, John">John Unsworth</name></editor><title level="m">A Companion to Digital Humanities</title><imprint><pubPlace>Oxford</pubPlace><publisher>Blackwell Publishing, Ltd</publisher><date value="2004"/><biblScope type="pages">323-347</biblScope></imprint></monogr></biblStruct><biblStruct><monogr><author><name reg="Lindemann, Marilee">Marilee Lindemann</name></author><title level="m">A Cambridge Companion to Willa Cather</title><imprint><pubPlace>Cambridge</pubPlace><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><date value="2005">2005</date></imprint></monogr></biblStruct><biblStruct><monogr><title level="m"><name reg="Program of the International Cather Seminar                                 2005">Program of the International Cather Seminar 2005</name></title><imprint/></monogr><note><xptr to="http://cather.unl.edu/seminar2005/sem_schedule.html" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/></note></biblStruct><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Ramsay, Stephen">Stephen Ramsay</name></author><author><name reg="Steger, Sara">Sara Steger</name></author><title level="a">Distinguished Speakers: Keyword Extraction and Critical
