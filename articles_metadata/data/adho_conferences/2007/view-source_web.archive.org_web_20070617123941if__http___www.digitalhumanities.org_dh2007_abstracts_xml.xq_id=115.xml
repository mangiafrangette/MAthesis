Burrows's Delta, a unitary measure of textual difference, has created a
                flurry of interest in authorship attribution and statistical stylistics since its
                introduction in 2001 (Burrows 2001, 2002a, 2002b, 2003, 2005; Hoover 2004b; García
                and Martín 2006; other studies are in progress). Burrows uses a Microsoft Excel
                spreadsheet to simplify and partially automate his calculation of Delta, and I have
                presented increasingly complex versions of The Delta Spreadsheet that more fully
                automate the calculation and the analysis of results (2004a, 2005a). I have also
                suggested possible improvements in how Delta is calculated or defined, which I have
                tentatively called “Delta Primes” (Hoover 2004c, 2005a, 2006).</p><p>The growing popularity of Delta analysis will surely lead to its further increased
                use. In addition to a number of studies in progress in the broad area of humanities
                computing, studies by other researchers are either already ongoing or being planned
                using Delta in the evaluation of high-stakes educational testing of writing in high
                schools, in the “authorship” of film direction, in evolutionary biology, and in
                studies of adverse drug reactions. The simplicity of automated versions of Delta
                analysis is critical to its increased use, especially for those who are not
                specialists in authorship attribution or humanities computing.</p><p>In its current state, The Delta Spreadsheet allows the user to paste in raw word
                frequency lists and then to perform a complete Delta analysis automatically by
                running a Visual Basic macro that calls other macros. One of the macros removes any
                words from the word list that are not found in the primary set of texts (the
                presence of such words would prevent the calculation of Delta by causing division by
                zero). Another macro changes the raw word frequencies into text percentages and
                inserts a zero frequency record in the word list for each text whenever any of the
                most frequent words does not occur in that text. This process is extremely tedious,
                time-consuming, and liable to error if done manually, especially on the large word
                lists that are now typically used in Delta analysis (800-4,000 words). Another
                optional macro removes personal pronouns. These pronouns are entered into a column
                in the spreadsheet, along with the master word list to be analyzed, and the user
                also can enter there any other words that should be eliminated (for example, noise
                words or proper names). The spreadsheet also allows the user to specify whether the
                word list should be culled to remove words for which a single text provides most of
                the occurrences, and, if so, to specify what percentage of occurrences should be
                used as the cut-off. The user can also specify the size of the word list to create
                for the analysis and the total number of words to analyze; the analysis macro can
                also be set to run several times based on increasing or decreasing numbers of words.
                The result of all this automation is that an entire Delta analysis can be performed
                as a background task. And, on modest numbers of texts that are not very large, an
                entire analysis can be performed easily in an hour. This allows a researcher to try
                many different combinations of options in the search for the most accurate and
                reliable results.</p><p>My current project involves further elaboration of The Delta Spreadsheet to automate
                more of the necessary processes. I have created an additional spreadsheet into which
                the user can enter a list of texts to be processed. Once the texts and their authors
                have been entered and the primary and secondary text sets specified, the user runs a
                macro that collects the word frequency lists of these files from the current
                directory and adds the appropriate text and author labels. This allows the user then
                to cut and paste the word lists into The Delta Spreadsheet for processing, which
                simplifies the process, saves time, and reduces error. A third spreadsheet designed
                for quicker analysis of results allows the user to paste in the results of a series
                of Delta analyses and run a macro that reformats, sorts, and prepares the data for
                graphing, with similar benefits.</p><p>A final significant upgrade of The Delta Spreadsheet takes advantage of an analysis
                by Shlomo Argamon (forthcoming) of the statistical bases of Delta. Argamon shows
                that Delta (as well as my proposed Delta Primes) can be calculated without relying
                on the mean frequencies of words in the primary set of texts. The revised method of
                calculation makes possible a more streamlined version of The Delta Spreadsheet that
                allows me to increase the number of texts that the spreadsheet can process. It
                should also improve the performance of the macros, which can take several hours to
                process a large number of long novels. My poster will show how the modifications
                improve the performance of the spreadsheets and will present an example with a very
                large number of authors. I will also be prepared to do a live software demonstration
                of the operation of the spreadsheets at the conference, both on already existing
                word frequency lists and on texts which conference attendees supply.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Argamon, Shlomo">Shlomo Argamon</name></author><title level="a">Interpreting Burrows’s Delta: Geometric and
