                    Structuralism, particularly as elucidated by Ferdinand de Saussure and
                    interpreted by Roland Barthes (drawing on Hjelmslev and others). It will further
                    be informed by the general theory of “autopoiesis” as articulated by Maturana
                    and Varela (1987) and by other recent studies of language and signification
                    influenced by systems theory.</p><p>Of particular importance to this treatment are the following Structuralist
                    principles: <list type="unordered"><item>Composite nature of the sign - a <emph rend="bold">sign</emph> is an
                            event or a relation between two components, a signifying part (<emph rend="bold">signifier</emph>, <emph rend="bold">expression</emph>,
                            or <emph rend="bold">token</emph>) and a signified part (the <emph rend="bold">content</emph> or <emph rend="bold">meaning</emph> of
                            the sign).</item><item>Arbitrary nature of the sign - the relation between signifier and
                            signified in a sign is arbitrary, not inevitable or given by nature.
                            Thus slippage is possible in principle and, in some systems, is common.
                            This potential for slippage is what accounts for much of the
                            flexibility, adaptability and power of sign systems.</item><item>Signs work in combination: individual words, for example, have their
                            significations, but when words are combined into sentences they become
                            more useful and more expressive.</item><item>Complete signs (considered as signifier/signified pairs) can also
                            enter into signifying relations. For example, a <emph rend="bold">metalanguage</emph> is a system of signs that describes another
                            system of signs; expressions in the metalanguage represent signs in the
                            signified sign system. Metalanguages provide channels of regulation and
                            feedback that are conducive to the development of the sign systems they
                            describe, and eventually (when formalized sufficiently) enable automated
                            processes to manipulate signs systematically. Conversely, a <emph rend="bold">connotative system</emph> is a system of signs in which
                            the signifying parts of signs are themselves signs (one might think of
                            literary texts). Connotative systems demonstrate the reciprocal
                            relations between layers in a sign system and the way significations at
                            higher levels can condition and affect signification at lower levels,
                            even apart from the application of metalanguages. While metalanguages
                            abstract and formalize the sign systems they describe, connotative
                            systems work by deploying signs as they are used concretely in other
                            contexts, bringing alternative significations into play. Likewise, while
                            metalanguages systematize and formalize, and thus indicate where
                            automated rules-based processing is possible, connotative systems draw
                            on and reflect particular significations available only in specific
                            local contexts, and indicate where automation by traditional means is
                            difficult or impossible.</item></list></p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_188_piez_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1: In both natural and artificial systems, a combination of

                        application is achieved through a layered structure in which components with
                        distinctive functions are made by combining simpler components.</figDesc></figure></div0><div0><head>The Semantics of Layers and the Layering of Semantics</head><p>A very useful distinction can be made between two different modes of
                    signification, which we can call <emph rend="bold">operational</emph> and <emph rend="bold">representational</emph> semantics. The representational
                    semantics of a sign corresponds to the conventional notion of what a sign is and
                    how it functions, that a sign “stands for” something, reflecting and naming an
                    actually existent “thing” in a real or imagined world. In contrast, the
                    operational semantics describes not what the sign refers to in a purported world
                    (which may or may not be present to the senses), but rather simply how it
                    operates within the signifying system — which generally includes the world, or
                    at least the present and active circumstances of the sign's use. (This in itself
                    is the major difference between “human” and “machine” semantics [Piez 2002].)
                    The rules of combination that allow any given set of signs to be assembled into
                    a higher-order organization, which itself has signifying potential, are part of
                    their operational semantics; but so also are any disambiguating “incidentals”.
                    At all layers, operational semantics may be conditioned or constrained by their
                    context of operation: the “meaning” of a sign is not built into the sign, but is
                    established <emph>ad hoc</emph>, by means of those distinctions between it and
                    possible alternatives that result in particular outcomes in application.</p><p>Interestingly, careful consideration suggests that while we often consider that
                    the representational aspect of a sign is fundamental to its operation and
                    provides part of its operational semantics, in general the opposite is the case:
                    operational semantics are primary, and representational semantics can only be
                    established once operational semantics are set and perhaps codified. Once a
                    sign's operation has been established repeatedly it can start to “carry its
                    context with it” — that is, its context can begin to include prior contexts,
                    implicitly recognized — and this is the beginning of representation. (A
                    compelling description of this process in human language development as well as
                    in the more rudimentary linguistic capabilities of chimpanzees, bonobos and
                    gorillas, may be read in [Greenspan and Shankar 2004].) Thus, what any given
                    sign represents must be inferred from its context of operation — which may
                    include the traces of other occasions of its use — and much energy is given, in
                    the application of sign systems to doing useful work in the world, to
                    negotiating these inferences.</p><p>The construction of layered sign systems, in which complex representations may be
                    reliably constructed by a rules-based assembly from simpler components, has the
                    precise advantage of managing and reducing this expenditure of energy.
                    Metalanguages (such as an orthography, formal logic, or the grammars of natural
                    or artificial languages), which describe sign systems themselves and stipulate
                    rules for their operation, are more than sterile intellectual exercises. By
                    abstracting and codifying the application of rules to signs, they reduce the
                    need to rely on sheer brute force methods (memorization or negotiation) to
                    support the assembly of signs into sign systems, thus reducing overall
                    complexity and enabling more sophisticated operations at higher levels.</p><p>Accordingly, media can be built out of building blocks constituted of other
                    media. Within a (relatively highly evolved) language, utterances take the form
                    of sentences or statements, composed out of words; words are composed of
                    phonemes (or of letters, in the case of written words). When sentences or
                    statements or propositions are combined, they constitute yet another medium at a
                    higher level, which might be identified with argument or narrative. Thus, media
                    are built in layers, each layer a hierarchy of subsystems on a lower layer. This
                    is characteristic of complex systems generally in both the natural and
                    artificial worlds (see [Simon 1996]).</p><p>In general, this layering is characterized by two related phenomena:<list type="unordered"><item>The distinctions between the layers becomes clearer over time: media
                            formats evolve and become more systematic and coherent in composition.
                            More and more complex and comprehensive structures become progressively
                            easier to realize, at the cost of a certain kind of expressive power
                            characteristic of early or individual experiments. The higher layers, as
                            they solidify and consolidate, induce a process of simplification and
                            rationalization at lower layers.</item><item>Likewise, as you go up the stack, the distinction between layers
                            becomes less clear. The difference between a letter and a word is almost
                            always clear, but the distinction between a statement and an argument is
                            less so.</item></list></p><p>As media ascend in complexity, each layer is capable of more “meaningfulness”
                    than the layer it is built on; or at least it has greater representational
                    power, due to the consolidation of operational and (on that basis) even of
                    representational semantics at lower layers. In turn, the context provided by the
                    combination of any set of tokens at any layer provides information relevant to
                    the construing of the local meaning of each of the constituent tokens. This
                    interpenetrating influence between layers, familiar to all students of language
                    and literature, is an important feature of the entire system.</p><p>The most complex and “highest” of these layers currently might go by the name of
                        <emph rend="bold">information architectures</emph>. Until recently we have
                    not really needed to have a name for this layer or members of it (signs that
                    appear in it), as they have for the most part been identified with print media:
                    we have spoken of indexes, cross-references, tables of contexts, abstracts,
                    summaries and bibliographies without being aware that these things might not
                    have to be printed on paper. This is because traditionally, in order to
                    stabilize complex bodies of information, particular features of print media have
                    been indispensible — temporal persistence and asynchrony; “random” or holistic
                    access; conventions of citation; graphic and typographic queues representing
                    organization and providing for navigability; economies of scale afforded by mass
                    production; and so on. Now these features are available in the formats provided
                    by digital media — along with elaborations of them such as the hyperlink,
                    dynamic display and device independence — it becomes useful to consider this
                    higher layer without identifying it with print technology.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_188_piez_2.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 2: Various different forms of communications media are formed by

                        generally possible, leading to representational correspondences not only
                        between media and the world, but across media themselves. At higher layers,
                        media find their own particular strengths, constituting 'worlds of their
                        own' whose representational capabilities are both presumably greater, and
                        more problematic.</figDesc></figure></div0><div0><head>The Emergence of the Digital</head><p>Like all media (cf. Marshall McLuhan), digital formats begin as representations
                    (operational refigurations) of prior media. But just as alphabetic literacy,
                    following the logic of its own peculiar operational semantics, quickly assumes
                    forms distinct from the oral forms it begins by mediating, digital media soon
                    become something other than the print counterparts that were to be “transmitted”
                    by telecommunications technologies. Again, it achieves these forms by layering.</p><p>Despite the highly developed form of the processing stack when it comes to the
                    computer's own processing (its operations), however, when it comes to digital
                    media we are still at a point when these layers are inchoate — although the
                    standardization efforts of the last decade (especially as regards HTML, CSS, XML
                    and XSLT) are providing a level of metalinguistic control conducive to their
                    development and maturation. Yet for the most part, applications of digital media
                    are still either derivative of other forms (in the sense that a page on the web
                    may be almost entirely analogous to the same document in print) or directly in
                    service to them; digital media have not fully come into their own.</p><p>Nonetheless, the usefulness and power of layering in this context too has long
                    been recognized: we only need to recall the familiar dogma (and the discussion
                    that has surrounded it) of the “separation of format from content” in the design
                    and deployment of markup-based publication systems (see [Sperberg- McQueen and
                    Burnard, 1994], [Durand et al. 1996], [Piez 2001], [Sperberg-McQueen et al.
                    2002], [Piez 2002]). This tradition recognizes that so-called “descriptive
                    encoding” works by anticipating and expressing at a lower layer (in what we call
                        <emph rend="bold">source code</emph>), the rationale for structures to be
                    expressed at higher layers through site organization, page layout, typography,
                    screen widgetry, linking and all the apparatus of a full-blown architecture. In
                    this respect, the tagging of an XML document whose encoding is descriptive and
                    data-oriented rather than prescriptive and application-oriented proves to be a
                    connotative system, as the signifiers (the element names “title” and “p”) that
                    describe the data (this chunk of text is a nominal paragraph; that one a title)
                    are themselves signs, to be transformed by a heuristic and rules-based process
                    into renditions that will themselves signify to readers that they are paragraphs
                    or titles. This anticipation or prolepsis by markup of further signification
                    elucidates the confusion as to whether we consider descriptive encoding to be at
                    a “higher” or “lower” layer, as indeed it is paradoxically both. Within a
                    classical three-tiered architecture, the XML encoding is “below” its HTML (or
                    print, or SVG, or ODF) rendition; yet we also describe the conversion from
                    descriptive XML into a presentational format such as HTML as a “down-conversion”
                    (since it “loses information”), by rendering only indirectly in presentational
                    features, if at all, what is explicit in the source. The reason we can, in
                    effect, go down to go up, is that here the lower layer achieves its aim of
                    scalability and reusability by working to describe a higher layer that it is not
                    yet practical (if it ever will be) for the computer to infer on its own: it
                    provides, in representational form by a kind of "sleight of hand" (the
                    operational semantics being invisible to the machine and left to the stylesheet
                    designer), information that would ordinarily be available only by a processing
                    context not yet available — the act of reading itself. In fact, the
                    transformation from descriptive XML to HTML is not actually taking it “up” the
                    ladder towards richer information design; it is merely transposing the data into
                    another stack altogether, where, since the operational semantics of HTML are
                    more tightly bound to standard processing contexts (the browser), its implicit
                    functionalities can be elaborated, while the representational aspect can be
                    deferred to where it makes more sense — where, because the tagging now signifies
                    “large and bold”, the reader can be trusted to infer “title”.</p><p>Yet the same discussion has also masked deeper problems and issues (see [Buzzetti
                    2002], [Caton 2005]) stemming from the limitations in current markup systems,
                    which can gracefully handle only a single organizational hierarchy at a time,
                    and thus lack the representational and expressive power necessary to take full
                    advantage of the computer's capabilities for useful automated processing of
                    complex textual artifacts.</p><p>Nevertheless, understanding digital text encoding technologies as complex sign
                    systems elucidates how and why they function without resorting to the
                    metaphysical appeal that “good” encoding should be designed to describe the
                    “thing itself”. Especially given the limitations inherent in XML's design, such
                    a position proves soon to be untenable; yet XML systems succeed in doing useful
                    work notwithstanding, and provide the foundations for sustainable, scalable and
                    navigable information resources, whose presentational features (interfaces) can
                    be improved over time. This in itself represents a major advance over what was
                    ever possible in the past.</p><p>More generally, a consideration of digital text encoding as a distinctive
                    semiotic system, with its own metalanguages and its own relation to media
                    artifacts, suggests why the humanistic study of digital media remains so foreign
                    to traditional disciplines in the humanities. Likewise, it points the way to the
