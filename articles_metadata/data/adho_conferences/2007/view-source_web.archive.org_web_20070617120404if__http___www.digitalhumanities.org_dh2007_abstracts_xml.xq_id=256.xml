                    the way people and organizations express, interact, and—quite
                    unforeseen—exercise influence. David R. Ellis’ film <title level="m">Snakes on a
                        Plane</title> (2006) starred by Samuel L. Jackson became the first movie to
                    incorporate materials suggested by bloggers long before the movie finished
                    filming. A social mass of blog-based fans influenced the Hollywood creation
                    providing ideas about plots and scenes that finally made it into the released
                    movie. The digital nature of the blog media provides access to an
                    always-expanding corpus of information. It would take more than a lifetime to
                    read all the available blogs necessary to answer questions such as what were the
                    more relevant plots suggested or what key concepts were managed by bloggers in
                    their ideas. However, human-centered analysis and visualization techniques may
                    help users navigate such enormous corpus. This paper presents how human-centered
                    analysis and visualization techniques help identifying relevant post portions
                    and visualizing concept relations in the blogosphere—Google blogs in particular
                    are used for illustrative purposes.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a brief
                    overview of the techniques and visualizations proposed to track the blogsphere.
                    We describe in section 3 how such tools can be applied to track the blogosphere.
                    Finally, we present some conclusions and further research directions in section
                    4.</p></div0><div0><head><label>2</label> Snakes, Bloggers, and Human-Innovation</head><p>Tracking the blogosphere requires at least (1) gathering blog posts and (2)
                    storing them in a structured metadata store before any analysis and
                    visualization can take place. Blogs rely on syndication feeds, usually
                    incarnating in the form of RSS or Atom feed—both based on XML (Miller, 2001;
                    AtomEnabled, 2006). The first step is to properly process blog feeds by
                    retrieving, annotating, and storing the posts’ contents in the feeds for later
                    analysis. Our approach stores the posts in a RDF-based (Shadbolt, 2006) metadata
                    store⁚Mulgara (Gearon, 2006)⁚waiting to be analyzed. Then, we use the extracted
                    text as the input of three different analysis and visualization techniques. It
                    is important to mention here that our approach is based on statistics instead of
                    more traditional approaches based on natural language processing—from which we
                    may benefit in future stages.</p><div1><head><label>2.1</label> BITS: Getting the relevant terms and excerpts of a post</head><p>BITS (blog induced topic selection) is a ranking algorithm for words and
                        sentences in a blog. Higher ranked words may be regarded as main topics used
                        in a blog. Similarly, higher ranked sentences express how key concepts are
                        used in the posts. BITS is inspired by HITS (hypertext induced topic
                        selection) algorithm proposed by Kleinberg (1999). BITS ranking is based on
                        mutually reinforcing relationship between sentences and words: important
                        sentences include many important words and important words are included by
                        many important sentences. The rankings are obtained by an iterative
                        calculation⁚further details can be found elsewhere (Kleinberg, 1999). Each
                        iteration we update the score of each sentence using the sum of scores of
                        all the words of the sentence; we also update the score of words using the
                        sum of scores of all the sentences containing the word.</p><p>This mutually recursive calculation provides two important outputs: (1) the
                        ranking of relevant words for a blog, and (2) the ranking of relevant
                        sentences. The ranking of words can be regarded as a summarization of the
                        topics discussed on a given blog. On the other hand, we regard the ranking
                        of sentences as an excerpt extraction technique capable of providing
                        relevant excerpts of a blog and, hence, a summarization tool.</p></div1><div1><head><label>2.3</label> ISNP: Modelling posts elements</head><p>The text contained in a post can be turned into a n-dimensional vector of
                        features using text mining techniques (Weiss, Indurkhya, Zhang,
                        &amp;Damerau, 2006). Each feature is a word in a blog post once stop
                        words are removed. Each vector entry represents a frequency measure for the
                        a given word—TFIDF in our particular case (Weiss, Indurkhya, Zhang,
                        &amp; Damerau, 2006). This simple transformation enables the usage of
                        machine learning techniques as tools for exploring and understanding the
                        processed blog posts. ISNP (Identifying Self/Non-self Post) is an algorithm
                        and visualization technique to create predictive models of posts on a given
                        blog. ISNP uses the postbased feature vectors to learn models that describe
                        and predicts what post belong to a feed. In particular ISNP induce linear
                        models based on support-vector machines (Vapnik, 1999; Cristianini &amp;
                        Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Shawe-Taylor &amp;Cristianini, 2004). Once the
                        models are learned, we can use them to: (1) predict pertinence to a feed
                        given a blog, (2) compare multiple feeds to measure degrees of topic
                        overlapping, and (3) visualize the key elements that identify self in a
                        post.</p><p>The proposed visualization based on ISNP results allows the analyst to
                        quickly distinguish the main topics that characterize a feed, and also
                        obtain a measure of the existing overlap between feeds from different posts.
                        The visualization presents a polar arrangement of the terms that distinguish
                        self and non-self blog feeds and the strength of each them—see Figure 1.
                        ISNP also provides another visualization of how topics change as new posts
                        are added to the blogs feed stream by displaying sliding windows of the
                        TFIDF values across the sequences of post of a blog—see Figure 2.</p></div1><div1><head><label>2.3</label> KeyGraph: Visualizing concept relations</head><p>When applied to blogs, KeyGraph (Ohsawa, Benson, &amp; Yachida, 1998) is
                        a chance discovery technique (Ohsawa &amp; McBurney, 2003) which provide
                        a visual map of the contest of the posts of a blog feed. A KeyGraph is a
                        graph where nodes are words on the blog posts and links indicate
                        co-ocurrence of words in sentences. KeyGraph has been widely used as tools
                        to support human innovation and creativity in on-line scenarios (Llor`a,
                        Goldberg, Ohsawa, Matsumura, Washida, Tamura, Masataka, Welge, Auvil,
                        Searsmith, Ohnishi, &amp; Chao, 2006). KeyGraph starts computing
                        high-frequency terms and high-frequency links among them given the sentences
                        of a blog. Then, relevant low frequency terms (key terms) and links (key
                        links) are identified. A key terms and key links bridge high frequency
                        clusters together, flagging interesting transitions between the concepts
                        described by those clusters. Finally, ranking high frequency and key terms
                        based on the connectivity degree allows the KeyGraph to identify keywords.</p><p>KeyGraph visualization represents concepts and their relations as visual
                        maps, favoring humanreflection. Moreover, it provides a simple exploratory
                        method to evaluate bridges between concepts, fundamental building blocks of
                        innovation and creativity. KeyGraphs are usually presented nodes and links
                        using three colors: grey to identify high frequency terms and links, red to
                        display key terms and links, and green border nodes to identify keywords—as
                        shown in Figure 3.</p></div1></div0><div0><head><label>3.</label> Tracking the Google Blog</head><p>To illustrate the capabilities of BITS, ISNP, and KeyGraphs we tracked the Google
                    Blog (<xptr to="http: //googleblog.blogspot.com/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>)
                    from November 10th to November 14th. A detailed description of the methodology
                    and results is beyond the scope of this paper and can be found elsewhere
                    (Llor`a, Yasui, Welge, &amp;Goldberg, 2007). However, we present some
                    illustrative examples of the blog analysis and visualization techniques proposed
                    in this paper. Unless noted otherwise, the results described below present the
                    analysis of the post entitled <emph>“Old world meets new on Google
                        Earth</emph>”<note n="1"><xptr to="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/old-world-meets-new-on-google-earth.html" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/></note></p><list type="unordered"><item><emph rend="bold">BITS. </emph>The BITS ranking provide the following
                        terms as relevant: <emph>map, earth, historic, explore, old, world, tool,
                            and cartography.</emph> The more relevant and descriptive sentence of the post
                            was: <emph>“I was able to explore and fly around the old maps and use the
                            transparency slider to compare the old world and the new; as I did this,
                            I thought to myself that this is the perfect marriage of historic
                            cartographic masterpieces with the innovative contemporary software
                            tools of Google.”</emph> After reading the complete post⁚not reproduced
                        due to its length⁚it became clear that the terms provided by BITS were an
                        accurate description of the topics discussed in the post. Moreover, the
                        extracted excerpts by BITS acted as a relevant summary of the posts in the
                        blog.</item><item><emph rend="bold">ISNP. </emph>ISNP was used to learn models that uniquely
                        identify posts. The linear model based on support-vector machines was able
                        to accurately distinguish between the ten post of the feed during the period
                        of observation. Moreover, the visualization of such models—see Figure 1—
                        correctly identified topic overlapping with two other posts talking about
                        Google Earth. ISNP also provided a simple visualization of how term
                        relevance changed through time, identifying recurrent topics—Figure 2
                        displays recurrent topics as wide areas on the accumulated vertical axis
                        graph.</item><item><emph rend="bold">KeyGraphs</emph>Finally, the last analysis and
                        visualization tool⁚KeyGraph⁚provided a clear map of the concepts managed in

                        relations⁚see Figure 3. KeyGraph clearly visualize the two main discourse
                        clusters provided by the overlapping posts, and also made explicit the
                        connection between them.</item></list></div0><div0><head><label>4.</label> Conclusions and Further Work</head><p>This paper has presented how human-centered analysis and visualization techniques
                    used to support innovation and creativity can also help to identify relevant
                    post portions and to visualize concept relations in the blogosphere. BITS, ISNP,
                    and KeyGraphs were introduced and used to analyze the posts on the Google Blog
                    for illustrative purposes. The proposed techniques showed how humancentered
                    techniques can easily assist tracking the blogosphere for relevant information,
                    concepts, and relations, filtering the amount of information that the analyst
                    need to review by providing meaningful summaries and visualizations.</p></div0><div0><head>Acknowledgments</head><p>We would like to thank the Automated Learning Group at the National Center for
