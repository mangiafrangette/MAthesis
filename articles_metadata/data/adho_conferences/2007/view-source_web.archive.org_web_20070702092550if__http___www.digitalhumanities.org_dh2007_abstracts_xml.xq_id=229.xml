                    grant project that used Geographical Information Systems (GIS). It explores the
                    institutional context in which the project took place, curricular and survey
                    results, implications for faculty development using a GIS tool in the
                    humanities, and a glimpse at where the project is leading in the study of
                    language, literature and culture. A GIS methodology we used allowed us to map
                    statistical information to make visible what might otherwise have been merely a
                    matrix of numeric data. It allowed us to distinguish meaningful patterns. We
                    have found that when the data come to bear upon historical, political or
                    sociological situations, they can have an impact upon the study of language,
                    culture and even literature, thus the humanities. Such was the premise of our
                    project, the International Studies/Language Technology Initiative, funded by
                    three American philanthropic foundations from 1999-2002, the Culpeper
                    Foundation, the Archbold Charitable Trust, and the Rockefeller Brothers
                        Fund.<note n="1"> See results reported on the Modern Languages, Literatures

                        author in the preparation of the GIS maps. </note></p><p>Our GIS initiative focused on International Studies, Sociology, and Modern
                    Languages and Literatures. We sought to improve our own analytical skills across
                    disciplinary divisions as a model for our students and to promote foreign
                    languages across the curriculum (FLAC).<note n="2">See information on successes
                        of FLAC in the liberal arts and professional schools, such as at the

                    Spanish, we introduced maps into the curriculum, combined maps with data sets,
                    and encouraged students to answer questions in the foreign language using these
                    materials, which involved relatively simple but relevant statistics that usually
                    had an historical or a sociological context. </p><p>The first level consisted of faculty development, followed by the creation and
                    pilot application of interactive maps to help students fill significant gaps in
                    their knowledge of geography, where they could work in pairs or small groups to
                    discuss clues about a country’s characteristics or location, then click on the
                    area within the borders to reveal the name and see if they were correct. This
                    approach eventually led to the creation of multimedia GIS maps where the name of
                    the country, capital city or other regions would be pronounced and where other
                    multimedia materials such as digital video with subtitles or captioning would
                    appear to assist language learners (Figures 1 and 2, originally in color).<note n="3">The digital annotation tool was obtained from Tandberg Educational,
                        Inc., and Divace Oy (now known as Sanako, Inc.), <title level="m"> Divace
                            Solo</title>, v. 4.0 (Turku, Finland: Divace Oy, 1997-2003). The product
                        is now known as <title level="m"> Media Assistant Solo</title>, CD-ROM,
                        published by Sanako, Inc. (Turku, Finland). The sample scene of inner-city
                        basketball in Paris was part of instruction materials created by the author
                        for French courses of various levels, necessitating varying types of
                        linguistic assistance, such as the English subtitles pictured here. Other
                        versions of the same audio-video materials included French captions or no
                        linguistic support materials.</note> The multimedia tagging of maps using a
                    proprietary GIS tool, <emph>MapInfo</emph>, allowed us to experiment with a kind
                    of hypertext and hypermedia suggested by Vannevar Bush’s article “As We May
                    Think” (<title type="j">Atlantic Monthly</title>, July 1945, 101-108) and which
                    have been explored by countless other researchers for a host of applications. We
                    are currently investigating the viability of non- proprietary GIS tools such as
                    QGIS and Google Earth applications. </p><p>In our project, we created some maps that showed change in demographic or other
                    features over time, others that showed local, regional, national, and
                    transnational patterns in trade, use of resources, socio-demographics and
                    politics. Several of these custom-designed GIS maps will be shown at the
                    presentation. Faculty anecdotally concluded that this work enhanced students’
                    ability to read tables, recognize spatial data, read maps, and use the computer
                    as an analytical tool, not just a word processor, e-mailing device, or means to
                    browse the Internet.</p><p>When applied to studies and classes in modern languages and literatures, we
                    developed pedagogies to encourage analytical and critical thinking. One
                    successful application was to pair this author’s French Translation class (FR
                    265) with a class in Urban/Suburban Sociology (SO 163) on several occasions,
                    where the latter’s students were charged with a task that is far from trivial,
                    one that Martyn Jessop in the 2006 ADHO conference identified: “The number of
                    digital datasets is growing rapidly and these are often of interest to
                    researchers in fields other than the often highly specialised one that the data
                    was originally derived for but how does one locate them?” (<title type="m">Digital Humanities 2006</title>, p. 101). The task in our case was a
                    “mapquest” activity to find French census data that would allow both the French
                    Translation and anglophone Sociology classes to analyze patterns of North
                    African demographics in France. These results were applied to the discussion in
                    another French class reading short selections from francophone North African
                    literature and about the political situation in France. The presentation will
                    more fully describe the survey results, partially illustrated in Figure 4, based
                    on the students’ responses to questions concerning the team activity and their
                    learning. </p><p>Applications of these maps to the study of French language and culture and
                    francophone literature come into focus when one “zooms” into a region, city,
                    Parisian <emph>arrondissement</emph> (district) and neighborhood and how it
                    actually looks, much as Stendhal zoomed in on the little town of Verrières in
                    the first chapter of <title type="m">Le rouge et le noir</title> (1830). Our
                    project constantly strove to put a human face on what might otherwise have
                    simply been an aerial photo or a map showing colorful patterns. Zooming in on
                    the La Glacière métro stop in Paris through French census data yields one
                    sense of the community. Another one emerges when one views the neighborhood from
                    street level and watches a documentary clip on street basketball (Figure
                        1).<note n="4">Thompson, Chantal P. and Bette G. Hirsch. Videotape to

                    in the 1920’s.<note n="5">Burgess, Ernest. <title level="m"> The Growth of the

                        1925. </note> The results of the French policy of centralization start to
                    become clear from this perspective by using a map that shows contrasts in
                    population (Figure 3, originally in color). This map and similar ones have
                    sparked student discussions of the differences in schooling between the United
                    States and France, of the relative sizes of cities, and other conversations that
                    have yielded a good number of “aha” moments. The complexity of these thoughts
                    and their expression depend upon the students’ language level. However, students
                    starting with the second year of university French study have been able to grasp
                    and discuss the implications of <emph>“L’Etat, c’est moi”</emph> for the general
                    French population under Louis XIV, a statement that presaged the migratory
                    movement that would lead approximately one quarter of the entire French
                    population to live within a forty-four-mile (seventy-one-kilometer) radius
                    starting from the center of Paris (Figure 3). </p><p>GIS tools have allowed us to create maps that help answer sociodemographic and
                    other questions that might never have been asked. These new products have made
                    visible certain patterns that would otherwise have been hidden in census and
                    other data (Figure 4, originally in color). This presentation shares the
                    background, materials and procedures by which the project was created and has
                    been sustained in several disciplines since 1999. To our knowledge, no creation
                    of similar materials for French and Sociology had been created.<note n="6">
                        Since March 1, 2000, a monumental integration of GIS, historical, cultural,
                        linguistic, artistic and other materials for the study of Asian cultures has
                        been carried out by Professor David Germano and colleagues for the Tibetan
                        and Himalayan Digital Library at the University of Virginia: <xptr to="http://www.thdl.org/index.php" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/> (Feb. 28,
                        2007).</note></p><p>Further work will involve the collection of authentic materials by U.S. students
                    on study abroad in France and by faculty members. The new materials will include
                    interviews with residents whose lives may already span various generations,
                    photographs linked to GPS coordinates, historical documents, and current realia.
                    These authentic materials will be integrated into language acquisition curricula
                    as well as higher-level courses by faculty in our French program in the proof of
                    concept phase. One prospective benefit is the encouragement of study abroad as
                    students become much more familiar with the people, sounds, sights, arts,
                    thoughts and sociological fabric of various towns and cities in France.
                    Quantitative and qualitative aspects will provide students with a fuller ability
                    to appreciate French culture and civilization as well as give them the chance to
                    work with peers who do not have the linguistic background to access the
                    materials first hand. The results of a small-scale study of such interaction
                    (Figure 5, originally in color) suggest that helping speakers of a foreign
                    language add a GIS analytical ability at the university level and in a career is
                    an easier task than the obverse, training users of GIS sufficiently in the
                    foreign language to allow them first-hand access to the foreign language
                    materials.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_229_goldfield_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1:</figDesc></figure><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_229_goldfield_2.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 2:</figDesc></figure><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_229_goldfield_3.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 3:</figDesc></figure><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_229_goldfield_4.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 4:</figDesc></figure><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_229_goldfield_5.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 5:</figDesc></figure></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
