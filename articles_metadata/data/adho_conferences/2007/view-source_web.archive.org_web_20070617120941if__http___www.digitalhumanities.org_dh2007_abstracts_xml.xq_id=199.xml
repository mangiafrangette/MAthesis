                    creations reflecting mankind’s ability of thinking and speaking. These are
                    texts. Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of manuscripts
                    created during the past thousands years that reached our days are of great
                    historic, artistic and cultural value. There is no doubt that written texts were
                    and remain one of the most valuable witnesses of the past of mankind, its
                    achievements and discoveries, world view, sufferings and errors.</p><p>It is well known that natural human language and texts in natural language,
                    accordingly, are among the most complicated things for study and interpretation.
                    The complexity increases several times for old texts.</p><p>One of the most effective means of preserving and increasing knowledge of old
                    texts is the steady philological, historical and textual study of and commentary
                    on them using the manuscripts. Unfortunately, the major part of the world
                    manuscript heritage is in need of the comprehensive study. Many manuscripts are
                    unpublished and inaccessible.</p></div0><div0><head>Objectives</head><p>Up-to-date computer technologies offer wide possibilities for preservation,
                    processing, study and popularisation of the manuscript cultural heritage of
                    mankind. The most promising method of comprehensive study of manuscripts is the
                    creation of digital libraries in the form of full-text databases. The advantages
                    of this type of collection are the volume of stored information, speedy search,
                    advanced data retrieval and ordering functionality, the ability to supplement
                    the database with new information and the ability to access it through the
                    Internet</p><p>The weaknesses of full-text databases are their complexity and the expenditure of
                    labour required to access the manuscript/text and its components. The depth of
                    fragmentation, number and composition of units, their properties and values all
                    must be determined beforehand, so the text is considerably simplified and the
                    means of establishing relationships between fragments can be absent.</p><p>While developing the Manuscript system <note n="1">Baranov, V.A., Votintsev, A.A., Gnutikov, R.M., Mironov, A.N., Oshchepkov, S.V., and Romanenko, V.A., <title level="a">Old

                    intended for storage, processing and publication of ancient manuscripts, the
                    research group of philologists and programmers at Udmurtia State University
                    developed a unique module for accessing the full-text database: a specialised
                    text editor called OldEd. Its distinctive feature is its combination of the
                    functions of traditional text processors with their visual presentation of text
                    and formatting capabilities, with the ability to build a corresponding
                    object-oriented database for each textual unit, which can be combined into
                    relationship hierarchies. </p><p>As is well known, text processors like Microsoft Word are well suited to
                    extension using their powerful object model and therefore provide a means of
                    interaction with databases as an interface to it (in this case, with full-text
                    databases of ancient texts). However an analysis of such a means of interacting
                    with the database using Microsoft Word showed that the development of our own
                    tools for editing Old Russian texts stored in the database would be considerably
                    less labour-consuming than customizing Microsoft Word or other software</p></div0><div0><head>Methodology</head><p>To work with data stored in full-text databases, it is advisable to create
                    special editors. In the process of developing the OldEd editor, our research
                    group was guided by the following requirements: <list type="ordered"><item>creation, input and editing of the document through direct interaction
                            with the database;</item><item>representation of the manuscript text in a form that would be close to
                            the original, including reproduction of glyph variants (Figure 1);</item><item>selection and creation of the manuscript/text units and manipulation
                            of their properties and values (Figure 2);</item><item>work with unit relationships (creation, change of subordination,
                            deletion, change of properties, visualization of relationships);</item><item>work with various hierarchical structures (unit selection, creation of
                            the relationship with the parent unit etc.) and representation of unit
                            relationships in the hierarchy as a tree (Figure 3);</item><item>work with unit dictionaries, their properties and values and
                            relationships (Figure 4);</item><item>support for simultaneous work with several manuscripts;</item><item>multi-user support.</item></list></p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">poster_199_gnutikov_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1: : Many texts, many languages and accurate reproduction of

                    providing access to data, the ability to read and record objects into the
                    database, visualisation of the units of the manuscripts/texts and their
                    hierarchical relationships, and representation of the document in the form of
                    formatted text.</p><p>The editor was written in C++, and the components were developed with the use of
                    ATL (Active Template Library). The client part was written using MFC (Microsoft
                    Foundation Classes). In operation the client interacts with the database of the
                    Manuscript system by means of a server API-procedure written as packages for the
                    Oracle database management system.</p></div0><div0><head>Results and Business benefits</head><p>The smallest unit that can be operated on by the editor is the glyph and its
                    variants. The largest units are the manuscript and text. It should be noted that
                    the relationships among the latter could be described by the notion ‘many to
                    many’: the manuscript can have many texts; one text can be represented in many
                    manuscripts.</p><p>The OldEd editor allows the user to work effectively with the visualised data –
                    units, their relationships, properties and values – of texts/manuscripts. The
                    editor enables representation of the hierarchies existing in a text/manuscript
                    and of the text as a transformed geometrical hierarchy. When working with the
                    text, the editor allows the user to edit the text and divide it into fragments.
                    When scrolling, the editor displays information on the relationships between the
                    text units, structural units and dictionary units; allows creation and deletion
                    of relationships between units; allows viewing and correction of their
                    properties and allows creation of new units (including texts). When displaying
                    relationships, the user can view and edit all unit relationships.</p></div0><div0><head>Further steps</head><p>The editor’s functional possibilities are being expanded in several directions:
                        <list type="unordered"><item>Since working with the editor currently requires a constant connection
                            with the database, it would be desirable to have a feature allowing the
                            user to download part of the document and work with it offline.</item><item>The present version of the editor could be used with a direct remote
                            connection to the database, but this is not allowed only for security
                            reasons. This is why the database management system is currently behind
                            a firewall and inaccessible from outside of the local network. This
                            situation should be changed, as the value of the system considerably
                            increases if many researchers can access it not only to acquire
                            information, but also to enrich the database. To achieve this goal, a
                            new additional web interface to data using the SOAP protocol should be
                            developed. Information on the ancient hand-written treasures stored in
                            the database is already accessible through a special web-interface in
                            viewing mode (as an illustration see our site devoted to the Putyata’s
                            Menaion manuscript <xptr to="http://manuscripts.ru/mns/portal.main?p1=19&amp;p_lid=2&amp;p_sid=1" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>).</item></list></p></div0><div0><head>Conclusions</head><p>The editor provides features for working with full-text databases: the
                    text/manuscript and their units are represented in a view that is close to the
                    original; the text/manuscript can be divided into fragments described by their
                    respective properties and values; units belonging to the same content area can
                    be organized in a hierarchy; any unit can have a standard variant (corresponding
                    dictionary unit); relationships can be established between any units (even
                    distant ones); and editing of units, their properties, values and relationships
                    can be done by the user directly in the text. In other words, the digital copy
                    of the manuscript/text can be represented not like a linear chain of units, but
                    like a complex network, each part of which is a model of a certain area of
                    information in the manuscript. All editor features are intended, first of all,
                    so that versatile operations can be performed on manuscripts/texts for further
                    processing of them in the databases, preparation of reference materials and
                    creation of printed and digital editions.</p><p>One of the most important advantages of the editor is that it allows simple,
                    consistent visual manipulation of the various units of structurally complex
                    manuscripts and texts so that users do not need to learn difficult markup
                    languages</p><p>For more detail about the editor see <xptr to="http://manuscripts.ru/pub/rd/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>.</p></div0><div0><head>Acknowledgment</head><p>The work was made possible thanks to the financial support of the Russian
