                    = GWb) is one of the most ambitious projects in German lexicography. Its
                    importance for literary and linguistic research on the writings of the most
                    famous German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) can not be
                    overestimated. Although still a work in progress – hitherto four volumes
                    (<emph>A—inhaftieren</emph>) have been completed – the GWb has become an
                    essential tool not only for the study of the wide ranging vocabulary of an
                    individual author, but also – due to the enormous influence of this author – an
                    indispensable instrument for research on the history of the German language and
                    culture during one of the key periods of their development. The vocabulary of
                    Goethe comprises about 90.000 words, more than any other writer in German has
                    ever used, because he not only wrote as a poet, but was also engaged in serious
                    research in fields like anatomy, geology and botany; and in addition to that he
                    served as a minister to the court of Weimar and was well familiar with all
                    aspects of the administrative language of his time.</p><p>The preparation of the GWb began shortly after the 2nd world war in 1947, the 1st
                    volume appeared in 1978, the second instalment of the 5th volume
                        (<emph>Jammernachbar—kanonieren</emph>) in 2005. In 2003 plans were
                    developed for the creation of a digital version of the GWb which so far had been
                    published only in a printed form. A grant proposal for the digitization had been
                    drawn up by the <emph>Competence Centre for Electronic Retrieval and Publication
                        Methods in the Humanities</emph> (<emph>Kompetenzzentrum für elektronische
                        Erschließungs- und Publikationsverfahren</emph>) at the University of Trier
                    in collaboration with the <emph>Interacademic Committee for the Goethe
                        Dictionary</emph> of three German Academies of Sciences and Humanities
                    (Berlin-Brandenburg, Göttingen, Heidelberg). </p><p>After receiving a grant from the <emph>German Research Association (Deutsche
                        Forschungsgemeinschaft)</emph> the digitization project started in May 2004
                    at the University of Trier. By end of 2005 the first 3 volumes were made freely
                    available on the internet (<xptr to="http://www.gwb.uni-trier.de" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) in a preliminary version which has been refined in the
                    following time considerably. In future the GWb will continue to be published in
                    print, but will be also made freely available on the Internet in a version which
                    is closely related to the printed form with its stable references for reliable
                    quotations. Conservative Goethe-scholars with their prejudices towards the new
                    media may quote the book, although their secretaries got the quotations from the
                    digital version. It is therefore essential that the digitized version is an
                    absolutely correct rendering of the printed version and offers the same degree
                    of reliability. However, the Internet version will offer much more than the book
                    with its restriction caused by the procrustean bed of its alphabetical
                    macrostructure: Via a comfortable and user-friendly interface, the electronic
                    GWb is to provide flexible and innovative possibilities for literary and
                    linguistic research on Goethe and the history of the German language and its
                    vocabulary as well as for everyone interested in Goethe and the language of his
                    time, both in Germany and abroad. The following short description of the
                    digitization project will outline the main features of its innovative approach
                    to making the informational potential of a traditional dictionary fully
                    available. The various steps of the project will be described in detail in the
                    proposed paper.</p><p>The first task in the project’s working plan consisted of a minute analysis of
                    all the typographical features of the microstructure of an entry in order to
                    draw up a carefully organised set of instructions or functional specifications
                        <emph>(Pflichtenheft)</emph> for the typists who should be enabled to apply
                    appropriate tags related to the specific typographical functions. This
                    preliminary tagging is done by the typist during his keying in the text of an
                    entry; it saves a considerable amount of time in a later stage of the project
                    when XML/TEI conformant markup is applied.</p><p>The text of the GWb has been made machine readable via double keying, a method
                    strongly recommended by Wilhelm Ott and successfully practised in previous
                    lexicographical projects of the Trier <emph>Competence Centre</emph>, e.g. the
                        <emph>Middle High German Dictionaries Interlinked</emph>
                        (<emph>Mittelhochdeutsche Wörterbücher im Verbund</emph>), <xptr to="http://www.MWV.uni-trier.de" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>, and the
                    digitization of the 33 vols. of the <emph>Deutsches Wörterbuch</emph> by Jacob
                    and Wilhelm Grimm, <xptr to="http://www.DWB.uni-trier.de" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>, the German equivalent to the OED. The
                    idea of scanning the GWb and using OCR software for processing the data had been
                    excluded from the beginning, because of the highly specialised typography and
                    the far too time-consuming and costly correction processes afterwards. The data
                    input took place in China. Two teams were capturing the GWb in MS-Word via
                    double keying and using TUSTEP-tags for encoding the typographical features and
                    the special characters. After the transfer of the data to Germany via e-mail,
                    the data were converted into the TUSTEP-format. The two versions were collated
                    automatically by TUSTEP-routines; TUSTEP also generated a list of differences,
                    which has been corrected manually after comparing the printed GWb. The result of
                    this step was an error-free TUSTEP-version of the GWb.</p><p>Apart from fulltext retrieval, the TUSTEP-version already offers a number of
                    other searches, but it is difficult to perform combined queries without further
                    markup. For this step the TEI-Guidelines were used; they were not followed
                    always strictly, some deviations were necessary to suit the specialities of the
                    microstructure of a GWb-entry. Because of the huge amount of data, the
                    XML/TEI-conformant markup had to be inserted by using automatic routines
                    wherever possible. For this we used again TUSTEP-modules which proved to work
                    efficiently and with an outmost degree of accuracy.</p><p>The XML/TEI-encoded data were stored in a data base and a graphical user
                    interface was developed using several tools and methods which we had used for
                    the previous lexicographical projects and which have been described elsewhere in
                    detail by Thomas Burch (<xptr to="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Tcl/TclConferencePapers2002/Tcl2002papers/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>).</p><p>The contribution will present a detailed introduction to the user interface and
                    the functionalities of the electronic GWb. We took great pains to display the
                    GWb in a way that makes it attractive and easy to use. Unlike other digital
                    dictionaries (OED, TLF) we did not allow to break up the macrostructure in
                    single entries separately shown (one screen = one entry), but kept the structure
                    of the printed dictionary thus allowing a comfortable overview over series of
                    compounds beginning with the same determinative. The framing of the window
                    allows an easy navigation especially through long entries with an elaborated
                    hierarchical microstructure, thus helping the user to find as quickly as
                    possible what he is looking for. – As the project is still a work in progress,
                    the presenting author would gladly discuss the perspectives of what remains to
                    be done.</p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
