                    conversation and correspondence, in rather different ways, reflecting a wide
                    variety of cultural forces and practices (Tannen 1990, Eckert &amp;
                    McConnell-Ginet 2003). Recent work has suggested that gender differences may
                    also be found in more formal, written communications. Koppel, Argamon, et al
                    (2002) have shown that gender of author can be accurately predicted between 70
                    and 80 percent of cases of published samples from the British National Corpus,
                    using machine learning and text mining techniques. Using simple statistical and
                    collocation techniques, Olsen (2005) has argued that there are distinct gender
                    differences in literary French from the 17th to the early 20th centuries. He
                    (Olsen: 2004) further proposed that the differences between male and female
                    writing during this time does not appear to support a "two cultures" model
                    (Liberman 2004), but that it was a more conscious political activity of domain
                    specific writing in which men and women deployed the same language.</p><p>We are addressing several issues that arise from our previous work on gender and
                    public writing in this study. The first is to apply machine learning and data
                    mining techniques to the same sample used by Olsen to examine the degree to
                    which conclusions found in Koppel, Argamon, et al. can be replicated for larger
                    sample of French literary texts. The methodologies used by Koppel, Argamon, et
                    al. and Olsen may have privileged identification of particular features, with
                    Koppel focusing on more stylistic aspects of writing and Olsen examining
                    significant frequency differences of content words. Use of a common approach
                    will allow us to examine the degree to which gender differences can be compared
                    between cultures and time periods. We also expect use of machine learning
                    techniques will allow us to test Olsen's claim that gender differences in French
                    literature are best explained as examples of what Liberman describes as
                    "dominance" theories of gender distinction. If the features that best
                    characterize gender difference are more "stylistic", this would suggest that
                    "difference" or two culture models are more applicable, but if differences are
                    shown in content words and these words are used in similar ways, we would argue
                    that the "dominance" or political theory may be a more effective explanatory
                    model. And finally, we are comparing several distinct statistical techniques,
                    most notably Support Vector Machine (SVM) and information gain models, to see
                    which are most effective at extracting weighted features that can be used to
                    interpret observed differences in male and female writing, comparing these with
                    more traditional examinations of differences in term frequency. Becuase of the
                    need to pick apart the learned model to examine its inner workings, with the
                    model itself as the end product of the learning process, some Digital Humanities
                    applications of machine learning techniques will differ in emphasis from more
                    common data mining tasks, where the end goal is often to maximize performance on
                    the classification of unknown data, and the model may be viewed as a black box.</p><p>This study is based on the creation of two samples of 300 texts roughly balanced
                    by genre, collection and time period driven by texts by French women writers
                    available to us. For each of the 300 texts by 67 female authors (18.5 million
                    words), we selected the chronologically closest male document by genre and,
                    where available, by collection, leading to a comparison collection of 300 texts
                    by 170 authors (27 million words). As noted in Olsen (2005), the samples are
                    largely drawn from the 18th-early 20th centuries with strongest representation
                    in the 19th century, owing to the predominance of romantic novelists in the
                    available collections of female writers. The sample is also skewed by the
                    presence of many works by particular notable authors, in particular George Sand.
                    The ARTFL project is currently adding a large block of texts to our collection
                    of French Women Writers (FWW) and these will be integrated into the full study,
                    depending on how much is available in time.</p><p>Each text in the corpus has been prepared by first tokenizing it and running it
                    through TreeTagger to determine lemmas and parts-of-speech for each token. In
                    cases of uncertainty, each possible assignment is assigned a probability value
                    between 0 and 1 by TreeTagger; currently, we only consider the most likely
                    analysis for each token (though we will apply more sophisticated techniques in
                    the sequel). We consider in the study several types of lexical features by which
                    to represent the texts numerically: Word Frequencies (WF), Lemma Frequencies
                    (LF), Part-of-speech Frequencies (PF), Word Bigram Frequencies (WBF), Lemma
                    Bigram Frequencies (LBF), and POS Bigram Frequencies (PBF). For each such
                    feature set, we compute a vector of numeric values for each text, where elements
                    of the vector represent the relative frequencies of various features in the set.
                    For example, a WF vector may contain entries for "la", "l'", "femme", and
                    "femmes", while the corresponding LF vector will contain entries just for "la"
                    and "femme", and the corresponding LBF vector may contain an entry for
                    "la/femme". Features that occur less than 10 times in the entire corpus are
                    elided; in some experiments, more stringent criteria for feature inclusion will
                    be used, to see how few features we can get away with.</p><p>For classification, we are applying the SVM method; SVMs are one of the most
                    successful modern methods for text categorization (Joachims 2002). We are
                    currently working with the Weka (Witten &amp; Frank 2005) implementation,
                    using a linear kernel and the default parameters. (Other options do not appear
                    to improve accuracy by much, so we used the simplest option, which also enables
                    easier interpretation of the results.) As the work progresses, we will be
                    evaluating computational efficiency, and may switch to other, faster, software
                    codes if necessary. The classification model constructed is a "linear model",
                    which means that it assigns a single numeric weight to each input feature,
                    positive for one input class (say, "femme") and negative for the other (say,
                    "homme"). The magnitude of the weight corresponds to the importance or influence
                    of the feature's value for classification; high weights indicate those features
                    with the most effect on the classification of a given text (in a specific
                    model). Once classified by the SVM method, we apply the information gain and
                    other metrics (Forman et al. 2003) to identify those features that are most
                    relevant to the classification task. Tokens and lemmas found in this step will
                    be compared to differential frequency tables already used by Olsen.</p><p>Preliminary classification results using Weka Sequential Minimal Optimization
                    (SMO) implementation of a support vector classifier with 10 fold
                    cross-validation confirm that author gender in this sample can be detected with
                    surprising reliability. For the entire sample, gender of author was correctly
                    identified 85.9% of the time using word lemmas and 85.7% on tokens, with lower
                    performance for both generic POS (73%) and more specific POS (75%). A second
                    test on paired 100 document male/female collections, to reduce the number of
                    works by Sand and smooth other main sample anomalies, achieved slightly better
                    performance, with correct classification by author gender at 87% for both
                    surface word forms (tokens) and lemmas, with POS again performing less well at
                    76.5% and POSgroups (abstract POS) at 72%. The accuracy performance of
                    classifications based on tokens and lemmas (86% and 87%) is somewhat higher than
                    the 70-80% performance for a sample modern English documents reported by Koppel
                    et al. (2002) This may be due to our use of all of the words in this experiment,
                    suggesting that men and women tend to write about different things and use
                    somewhat different vocabularies.</p><p>Table 1 shows the confusion matrix from the Weka SMO classification expressed as
                    the correct classification rate broken down by feature type. In both samples,
                    the highest performing features (tokens and lemmas) are considerably better at
                    identification of male authors than female authors. We have noted this
                    difference in other recent work on modern English data. Surprisingly, the
                    opposite is true (in 3 of 4 instances) for part of speech features, though it is
                    unlikely that the differences are statistically significant.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_161_olsen_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Table 1</figDesc></figure><p>Using a variety of techniques, we can effectively distinguish between male and
                    female authors. Examination of the highest weighted features using the
                    information gain (IG) measure on the 2x92 subset sample reveals clear agreement
                    with previous work. Female authors show a strong preference for writing about
                    women (noted by the pronoun <emph>elle</emph>), adopt a more personal and
                    reflective frame (je, me), and address (vous). This is consistently shown in
                    both selected tokens and lemmas, and is also indicated in the part of speech
                    analysis by a preference for the use of personal pronouns, indefinite pronouns
                    and possessive pronouns. Examination of tokens assigned a high information gain
                    in the subset selected to correct for sample biases reveals the same female
                    concern for descriptions of internal, subjective and emotive states described by
                    Olsen (2005). These terms include émotions, amitié, chagrin, courage, craint*
                    esprit* desire. generosité, larmes, motifs, peines, penser, plaisirs,
                    réflexions, sensible, sentiment, sentis, soin*, and souffrance. The IG measures
                    are notable for some striking absences from Olsen's examination, including terms
                    like amour* and aim* which were strongly correlated to female discourse, as well
                    as many kinship terms (oncle, maman, enfant, parents, etc.). Terms with high
                    information gain values that are more common in male than female writers are
                    less clearly grouped and are missing the strong preference noted in Olsen for
                    abstractions and numbers. However, when examining the PoS measures, ordinal
                    numbers are preferred by male writers. These variations arise from using the IG
                    measure as opposed to differences in relative frequencies to assess "importance"
                    and examination of a small but more random sample, issues which will be explored
                    in the full paper.</p><p>Text mining techniques can identify gender of author using a variety of models
                    with impressive accuracy. The features ranked most highly in learned
                    classification tend to confirm previous results and point to the possibility of
                    cross-language patterns of gendered language use. The full paper will explore
                    the reasons for the higher accuracy performance in identifying male authors and
                    examine in more detail the male and female author feature sets with specific
                    reference to the differences in ranked features arising from different
                    techniques. Finally, we will address the larger question of whether the clear
                    distinctions of male and female public writing in this sample arise from a "two
                    cultures" interpretation or more conscious political stances by a systematic
                    analysis of word collocations around particularly gender specific terms.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><monogr><author><name reg="Eckert, Penelope">Penelope Eckert</name></author><author><name reg="McConnell-Ginet, Sally">Sally McConnell-Ginet</name></author><title level="m">Language and Gender</title><imprint><pubPlace>Cambridge</pubPlace><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><date value="2003">2003</date></imprint></monogr></biblStruct><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Forman, George">George Forman</name></author><author><name reg="Guyon, Isabelle">Isabelle Guyon</name></author><author><name reg="Elisseff, André">André Elisseff</name></author><title level="a">An Extensive Empirical Study of Feature Selection
