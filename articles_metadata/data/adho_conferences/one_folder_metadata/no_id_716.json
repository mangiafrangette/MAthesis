{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The Great Recession beginning in 2008 has resulted in a series of budgetary cuts to many universities, education programs, and cultural institutions that reflect indifference about, and even hostility toward, the humanities and arts. Unlike the sciences - who have an established tradition of public advocacy and media communication - the humanities have no consistent, planned tradition of advocacy. This paper argues for planned humanities advocacy using the affordances of the digital humanities. In particular, it discusses how the 4Humanities initiative is leveraging DH for next-generation advocacy through text analysis of pubic discourse about the humanities and crowd-sourced generation of arguments for the humanities; by showing how statistics and other evidence about the contribution of the humanities to society can be analyzed and visualized; and by discussing how DH can provide special tools for humanities advocacy, while humanities advocacy can in return incentivize the creation of next-generation DH research and teaching tools.", "article_title": "4Humanities: Designing Digital Advocacy", "authors": [{"given": "Lindsay", "family": "Thomas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, Santa Barbara, United States of America", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}, {"given": "Alan", "family": "Liu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, Santa Barbara, United States of America", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}, {"given": "Geoffrey", "family": "Rockwell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "St√©fan", "family": "Sinclair", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McGill University", "normalized_name": "McGill University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01pxwe438", "GRID": "grid.14709.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Melissa", "family": "Terras", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University College London", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Jared", "family": "Bielby", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Victoria", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Turcato", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McGill University", "normalized_name": "McGill University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01pxwe438", "GRID": "grid.14709.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Christine", "family": "Henseler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Union College", "normalized_name": "Union College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/058w5nk68", "GRID": "grid.265438.e"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "digital humanities - institutional support", "text analysis"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
