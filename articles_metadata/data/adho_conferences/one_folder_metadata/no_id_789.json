The primary motivation for the creation of SDFB is to make possible a new way to reconstruct, represent, and study the complex relations between authors, texts, publishers, and readers in the early modern period. It combines computational and statistical methods, which can explore the relationships of thousands of historical figures using hundreds of thousands of source documents, with the local expertise of a growing number of humanities scholars.", "article_title": "Six Degrees of Francis Bacon", "authors": [{"given": "Michael Andrew", "family": "Finegold", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Carnegie Mellon University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05x2bcf33", "GRID": "grid.147455.6"}}]}, {"given": "Christopher", "family": "Warren", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Carnegie Mellon University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05x2bcf33", "GRID": "grid.147455.6"}}]}, {"given": "Cosma", "family": "Shalizi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Carnegie Mellon University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05x2bcf33", "GRID": "grid.147455.6"}}]}, {"given": "Daniel", "family": "Shore", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Georgetown University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Georgetown University", "country": "Qatar", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/029e47x73", "GRID": "grid.452129.9"}}]}, {"given": "Lawrence", "family": "Wang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Carnegie Mellon University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05x2bcf33", "GRID": "grid.147455.6"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "networks", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling", "graphs", "relationships"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
