We discuss the technologies related to XML markup languages and the processing of marked-up documents. We describe the method used to design and implement the TeiCoPhiLib, outlining the design patterns as well as discussing general benefits of the overall architecture. Finally, we present case studies in which some components of our library currently implemented in Java have been used.", "article_title": "TeiCoPhiLib: A Library of Components for the Domain of Collaborative Philology", "authors": [{"given": "Federico", "family": "Boschetti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "A.
