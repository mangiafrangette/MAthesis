{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "While visualization is an indisputably important aspect of data modeling in the humanities, the static nature of most data model visualizations results paradoxically in the creation of a barrier to research exploration as well as an aid. We present here a tool for interactive modeling, manipulation, and alteration of a text variant graph model, as produced by the current generation of text collation tools. Our tool, written in Javascript for direct use in the browser, can be adapted to any humanities problem domain that can be expressed in sequence variation. We see the tool as an important example and precedent for eliminating the problematic authority (whether intentional or not) that often accompanies computer-generated models.", "article_title": "An Interactive Interface for Text Variant Graph Models", "authors": [{"given": "Tara Lee", "family": "Andrews", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "KU Leuven, Belgium", "normalized_name": "KU Leuven", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05f950310", "GRID": "grid.5596.f"}}]}, {"given": "Joris Job", "family": "Van Zundert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Huygens ING, Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (KNAW)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["networks", "philology", "   ", "content analysis", "scholarly editing", "text analysis", "relationships", "graphs", "software design and development", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling", "interface and user experience design"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
