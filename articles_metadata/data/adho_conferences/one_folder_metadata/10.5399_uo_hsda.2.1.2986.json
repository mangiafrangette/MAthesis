This paper analyzes two theses. The first holds that the text, due to its genetic and historic nature, is always IMMUTABLE, STABLE, and never mobile. For this reason, the text represents the foundational element of a specific society, modern society. The second thesis is based on the assertion that within information and hypertext technologies two diverse views confront and contrast each other. I locate these tendencies in the following key words: “dream” (Nelson) and “intellect” (Engelbart). Hypertext technology and culture represent the most transformative location and agency, they are the actors of the paradigm shift in which we are implicated. The hypertext revolution is based on the criticism of and attack against the material supports of writing and reading, as well as typographic technologies. Hypertext fights and wins this battle. However, hypertext technology is not able to reach the deep structure of alphabetic culture that is made not only of material support but also mental and bodily experience, consolidated and evolving, and of social relationships that are implied in the materiality of the support.", "article_title": "Il testo (non) è mobile", "authors": [{"given": "Mario", "family": "Ricciardi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Politecnico di Torino", "normalized_name": "Polytechnic University of Turin", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bgk9508", "GRID": "grid.4800.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
