What sorts of patterns might arise, for example, if we look at a visualization of a script in juxtaposition with a spectrogram of the audio track? How can we look at the spatial and temporal difference between pixel color from one frame to the next as it might relate to a motion analysis? We are excited about some early work in this field done by others, and hope our experiments will contribute to the discourse and develop a more robust model of quantitative, algorithmic analysis of digital video objects.", "article_title": "Approaching Algorithmic Media Analysis in the Humanities: An Experimental Testbed", "authors": [{"given": "Jarom Lyle", "family": "McDonald", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Brigham Young University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Brigham Young University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047rhhm47", "GRID": "grid.253294.b"}}]}, {"given": "Ian", "family": "Hunter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Brigham Young University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Brigham Young University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047rhhm47", "GRID": "grid.253294.b"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["knowledge representation", "video", "audio", "media studies", "analysis and visualisation", "film and cinema studies", "multimedia"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
