{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The Day of Digital Humanities has become part of the Digital Humanities landscape: Inspired by the project, the Day of Archaeology (DoA) was established by a group of professional digital archaeologists and PhD students in 2011. With over 500 participants, the web project aims to collate archaeological experiences and connect archaeologists across the world, using a variety of digital technologies. The participants record and share their Day on the Wordpress-based DoA website: www.dayofarchaeology.com, alongside photo-sharing sites, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This paper will explore how the Day of Digital Humanities model has translated into a more defined discipline; what the DoA has learned from Day of Digital Humanities; the difficulties and benefits of the web-based model when applied to archaeology; how social media has been used; and what impact the DoA has had, and will have as it develops, for participants, the archaeology community and the wider public.", "article_title": "Inspired by DH: The Day of Archaeology", "authors": [{"given": "Lorna-Jane", "family": "Richardson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["knowledge representation", "crowdsourcing", "video", "  ", "audio", "       ", "internet / world wide web", "social media", "archaeology", "multimedia", "    "], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
