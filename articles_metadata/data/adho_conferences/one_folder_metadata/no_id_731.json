{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The Digital Curator team have recently launched a unique Digital Scholarship Training Programme, aimed at providing nearly 300 curators across Scholarship & Collections with hands-on opportunities and space to delve into the key concepts, methods and tools that define today’s digital scholarship practice. The aim is to enable curators to situate their collection expertise in the realm of facilitating digital scholarship and to provide them with the practical skills to do so. The ambitious two-year initiative will deliver a core set of fifteen bespoke one-day courses twice a year, covering topics such as basics of the web, data visualisation for analysis in scholarly research and the use of linked data, API’s and the semantic web in libraries. This short paper will discuss the programme's design and report on the first quarter’s progress, outcomes, best practices and lessons learned in the hopes this model may be useful for similar institutions.", "article_title": "The Digital Scholarship Training Programme at British Library", "authors": [{"given": "Nora", "family": "McGregor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "British Library, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "British Library", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05dhe8b71", "GRID": "grid.36212.34"}}]}, {"given": "Adam", "family": "Farquhar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "British Library, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "British Library", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05dhe8b71", "GRID": "grid.36212.34"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "sustainability and preservation", "repositories", "digital humanities — pedagogy and curriculum", "project design", "digital humanities — facilities", "archives", "digital humanities — institutional support", "management", "GLAM: galleries, libraries, archives, museums", "organization"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
