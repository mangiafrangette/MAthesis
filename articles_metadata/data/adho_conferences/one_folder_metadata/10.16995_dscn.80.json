Collaboration within these teams is undertaken by librarians, academics, undergraduate and graduate students, research assistants, computer programmers and developers, content experts, and other individuals. While this diversity of people, skills and perspectives creates benefits for the teams, at the same time, it creates a series of challenges which must be minimized to ensure project success. Drawing upon interview and survey data, this paper explores the benefits, challenges, and patterns of interaction associated with these types of project teams. It will conclude with a series of recommendations focused on harnessing the advantages while minimizing the challenges.", "article_title": "“More Minds are Brought to Bear on a Problem”: Methods of Interaction and Collaboration within Digital Humanities Research Teams", "authors": [{"given": "Lynne", "family": "Siemens", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Richard", "family": "Cunningham", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Acadia University", "normalized_name": "Acadia University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00839we02", "GRID": "grid.411959.1"}}]}, {"given": "Wendy", "family": "Duff", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Toronto", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}, {"given": "Claire", "family": "Warwick", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University College London", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "2", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
