This is necessary not only to provide more effective computational support for scholarship in the humanities, but also in order for humanities computing itself to become something more than a “bag of tricks”. This paper describes promising developments already underway in several areas within humanities computing, generalizes from past, if partial, successes (text encoding), draws parallels with recent work in bioinformatics, and argues that the logical identity of conceptual modeling and theory-construction makes conceptual modeling simply a computationally oriented variant of scientific explanation, and, more broadly, interpretation and understanding in general. As an example of how model development can provide fundamental insights into the cultural world a case is described where a set of ontology evaluation criteria developed within computer science is applied to an influential framework for cultural entities and the result that a radical reconfiguration of that framework is suggested.Acknowledgements: There is undoubtedly much here that is influenced by seminal papers on these issues by Willard McCarty and John Unsworth; I acknowledge a debt to them without of course any suggestion that they see things as described here.IntroductionThe nature of humanities computing has long been problematic in the digital humanities community. Part of the reason for this anxiety is that humanities computing is struggling to move out of a pre-scientific phase. “Science” here is of course intended to be taken in the broadest possible sense — the point is not to separate disciplines such as physics on the one hand from, say, literary studies on the other, but rather to distinguish practices that have primarily non-epistemic non-theoretical objectives from those that have understanding, explanation, and knowledge as their principal immediate goals. Nor is there any implication of a clear boundary between scientific practices and non-scientific practices, or that there isn’t a complex and essential mutual involvement — the claim is only that some rough distinction of this sort is possible and useful.If humanities computing is to mature as a coherent field of intellectual inquiry it will need to make a transition from being an ad hoc set of useful techniques, to more systematic general methods and theories that make direct contact with the specific methods and theories of the disciplines it supports. This theme is not new, but our progress has been modest so far and some further discussion and elaboration is in order.First, there are new reasons to be optimistic. For one thing this progress is already occurring in other informatics fields—bioinformatics as an example—and the specifics of these changes provide an indication of how things might go in humanities computing as well. Moreover the growing significance of conceptual models and ontologies that is already in evidence in humanities computing, and the nature of the discourse around them, is a sign that this transition is perhaps already underway. Finally one of the most theoretically productive areas within the humanities computing community, namely text encoding, arguably has been as successful as it has precisely to the extent that it has embodied the features recommended here — and owes its limitations and disappointments to the extent to which it has not. What all these things have in common is the foregrounding of conceptual modeling, explicitly or implicitly.I use the term “conceptual modeling” broadly, meaning any formally defined abstract representation of a domain of interest. Typical examples of modeling languages are the ER and UML diagrams used in business applications, logic-based knowledge representation formalisms such as description logics or the frame languages (such as the KL-ONE family) common in artificial intelligence, and the various formal ontologies now used in computational biology and elsewhereScience in the broad sense is the development of understanding. Scientific understanding comes typically in the form of theories, and theories are at least in part the systematic identification of objects and relationships that are the salient features of some domain. Informatic disciplines must put these theories, formalized as conceptual models that support computational processing, at the center of their identity. And for informatic disciplines to be sciences themselves they must not only exploit such conceptual models, but participate in their development and exploration. This is true for informatics in general, and for humanities computing in particular.Modeling in BioinformaticsOther areas that began as craft-like bag-of-tricks approaches to applying computing to a scientific field have now begun to evolve a more coherent body of method, theory, and metatheory. Perhaps the most dramatic case is bioinformatics. Although initially a haphazard and opportunistic application of computing techniques, there are now a considerable number of families of well-theorized methods tightly tied to biological theory. Of particular interest here is the role of so-called ontologies in contemporary bioinformatics such as the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000), the Foundational Model of Anatomy (Rossee & Mejino, 2003), and other ontologies in genomics, molecular function, neuroscience, biodiversity, and other areas of the life sciences as well. An enormous amount of effort is going into the development and use of these formal models.In some cases the influence on biological science per se has still been modest, but generally the results are extremely promising and in a few cases the influence has been stunning. The Gene Ontology in particular, has been enormously successful and provides the overall framework for contemporary genomics. Of special significance for us is the extent to which the fundamental explanatory entities and properties of biological theories are explicitly identified as the core constituents of these conceptual models, blending the work of first order science with its bioinformatics support.Modeling in the Cultural SciencesWithin the humanities computing community text encoding systems such as the TEI can be seen as a step in the same direction as the new ontology-based models in computational biology. Behind the methods of the TEI is at least arguably an informal positing of text models, components, and relationships. However unlike the bioinformatic ontologies the models being indicated by text encoding techniques are only indirectly and implicitly identified. This has been pointed out by a number of critics (Raymond & Tompa, 1992; Raymond, Tompa, & Wood, 1996, 1998, 2001; Buzzetti, 2002), and projects to develop remedies are underway (Sperberg-McQueen et al., 2002; Renear et al., 2003).Another promising sign are the ontologies being developed in museum studies CIDOC/CRM (Crofts et al., 2003) and library science (IFLA 1998). For the most part these are being put forward as frameworks for designing digital information management systems or shaping the development of standards, policies, and procedures, but to the extent that they succeed at efficient, functional, and interoperable systems they may be considered confirmed as substantive theoretical proposals for how to understand the nature of the cultural world. And where these models and ontologies appear to be applications of existing explanatory theories of cultural objects and relationships that is more evidence that they are achievements which advance our understanding of that world.An Example: Revising FRBRWhat follows is an example intended to support two claims. First that the evolution of conceptual models intended to support information systems design can in fact be an activity of first order science (in the broad sense), and second that precisely the same techniques designed for general evaluation of ontologies in natural science can be effectively employed in evaluating cultural ontologies.Several models for cultural objects identify such things as works, texts, editions, and individual items as types of things, fundamental kinds. Not only are various sorts of conceptual arguments advanced in favor of such an analysis, but so is the relative success of such frameworks in guiding the design of effective information systems that are effective, efficient, and interoperable. That is, the conceptual and practical success of these systems can be taken as indicating that they correctly represent how things are. A well-known model of this sort is IFLA’s Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (IFLA 1998), a framework designed primarily to support library cataloguing, but which clearly has wider application — FRBR in fact describes itself as a “conceptual model of the bibliographic universe”. A puzzle recently emerged about an assignment of one particular cultural object (XML documents, as defined in the W3C XML standard) to the appropriate FRBR entity type. Some considerations argued for an assignment to the FRBR expression (roughly: text) entity type, and other competing considerations argued for assignment to the FRBR manifestation (roughly: edition, or format) entity type. The proposed resolution was an awkward and unsatisfying exception to the FRBR framework which preserved the ontology of works, expressions, editions, at the cost of complexities elsewhere. (Renear et al 2002, Renear 2005).Two years later however it was noted that when a proposed criterion for ontology evaluation which had been developed for scientific and general purpose ontologies (Guarino & Welty, 2000; Guarino & Welty, 2002) was applied to the FRBR framework the result was an anomaly that suggested refactoring the four Group 1 entity types into new entities and corresponding roles. (Renear, 2006). Under the resulting revised model the manifestation and expression entity types are not treated as true entity types (fundamental kinds), but rather roles (relationships) that entities of other types have in particular circumstances—and in fact this revision was extended to all four FRBR entities (Renear & Dubin, forthcoming). We realized that this new way of conceptualizing cultural objects appeared to be an application of a more general approach developed by John Searle (1995) as well as consistent with some work in aesthetics (Levinson 1980). In short, all four FRBR “entities” can be reinterpreted not as entities but as roles that other non-cultural things have under specific social contexts of “collective intentionality”.That this is not just a practical adjustment in a conceptual model for humanities computing, but a substantive claim in the science of cultural objects in general, can be established by comparing it to familiar claims about cultural objects by scholars such as Ingarden, Wellek, Richards, Fish, Goodman, Tanselle, Schillingsburg and others. In this comparison contradiction will serve as well as convergence to make the point that these assertions fall within the domain of humanist inquiry, and not merely within some auxiliary practice.The Relative Neutrality of these RecommendationsIt may be thought that putting conceptual modeling at the heart of humanities computing and seeing the development of models as first order scholarship in the humanities requires accepting some archaic and dubious philosophical view, a positivistic scientism perhaps, or even philosophical realism. But this is not so. It is possible to engage in ontology without taking a philosophical meta-ontological position. Many different philosophical positions (including constructivism and relativism) are all perfectly consistent with taking conceptual modeling as the natural activity of humanities computing, and at least part of humanities scholarship more generally. Of course the results of modeling will not be neutral vis-à-vis other first order theories, but the activity of modeling need not be exceptionally controversial. Again the experience of bioinformatics, where researchers with different philosophical views (or no philosophical views at all) nevertheless often agree, or more importantly disagree, on specific issues without rejecting the overall approach, is significant. This is not to say that the position is entirely neutral. It may well conflict with some general accounts of humanistic inquiry which hold that such inquiry is radically different than the natural sciences, especially if those accounts are understood as applying in general or without exception to the entire range of humanistic scholarship — although I am not yet convinced that it does in fact conflict with the traditions of hermeneutics and verstehen, despite the differences in tone and direction. In any case that the recommendation is not entirely uncontroversial cannot be taken as a decisive mark against it at the outset. Whether it is sound or not will depend on how it fares against its competitors in improving our knowledge and understanding of the cultural world.Concluding RemarksI have argued that humanities computing must make conceptual modeling its central defining activity if it is to fully realize its promise to substantially advance humanities scholarship, and that such modeling is an intrinsic part of first order humanities inquiry, and not merely an auxiliary activity.", "article_title": "Modeling, Explanation, and Ontology in the Cultural Sciences", "authors": [{"given": "Allen H.
