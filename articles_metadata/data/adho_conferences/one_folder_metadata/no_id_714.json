Integral to various interventions is a distinction between the material form and linguistic content of source material and a desire to bring audiences closer to both. My proposed paper will discuss my continuing project for the UNL's Center for Digital Research in the Humanities to build a dynamic, visually-rich, and critically nuanced history of Willa Cather’s Death Comes for the Archbishop (1927) as a series of material objects in multiple forms, including but not limited to manuscripts, notable editions, notebooks, translations, and interviews. I report on the challenges I have encountered in this process and explain some of the decisions I've faced.", "article_title": "Representing Materiality in a Digital Archive: Death Comes for the Archbishop as a Case Study", "authors": [{"given": "Matthew", "family": "Lavin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["bibliographic methods / textual studies", "metadata", "content analysis", "xml", "digitisation — theory and practice", "literary studies", "encoding - theory and practice", "ontologies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
