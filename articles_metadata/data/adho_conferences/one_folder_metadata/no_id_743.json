{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This short paper presents new capabilities of Collective Biographies of Women (CBW), a UVA/IATH project with a database of over 1200 volumes, comprising more than 13,000 biographies of more than 8000 women. We introduce the phrase, “documentary social network,” to refer to prosopographical representations rather than actual social networks; the books published 1830-1940 collect short versions of many persons and types, documenting trends in representation across periods and nations. The paper examines various radial and columnar graphs of \"siblings\" and \"cousins\" (degrees of separation among 1,2, or more books) of famous and obscure women of differing roles. CBW's documentary networks, along with our innovative markup schema, open a field of ramifying versions of female biography defying gender norms; our findings enrich studies in biography, model new approaches to \"personography,\" and display on both micro and macro scales a digital historiography beyond time and period, place and nationality.", "article_title": "Documentary Social Networks: Collective Biographies of Women", "authors": [{"given": "Alison", "family": "Booth", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": "Worthy", "family": "Martin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["networks", "historical studies", "   ", "literary studies", "text analysis", "graphs", "gender studies", "relationships"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
