As part of the _Knowledge Management_ process, _Knowledge Socialization_ is a critical step during which the community experiences a decisive interchange of ideas. In this work, we present *a new model for _Knowledge Management_* based on the classic Nonaka and Takeuchi's one but adapted to the Web 2.0 by using wiki technologies to support _Knowledge Socialization_, and we propose *to apply this model to the case of _elBulli_*. _elBulli_, voted by _Restaurant_ magazine as the best restaurant in the world for five years, has now become a foundation for creativity and innovation in high cuisine. It incorporates disciplines such as technology, science, and the arts in its research, and it publishes its results in conferences, books or journal articles. Therefore, elBulli is an appropriate case to apply a _Knowledge Management_ model that makes maximum use of its knowledge.", "article_title": "Collaborative technologies for Knowledge Socialization: the case of elBulli", "authors": [{"given": "Antonio", "family": "Jiménez-Mavillard", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The CulturePlex Laboratory - Western University Canada", "normalized_name": "Western University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02grkyz14", "GRID": "grid.39381.30"}}]}, {"given": "Juan Luis", "family": "Suárez", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The CulturePlex Laboratory - Western University Canada", "normalized_name": "Western University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02grkyz14", "GRID": "grid.39381.30"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "interdisciplinary collaboration", "social media"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
