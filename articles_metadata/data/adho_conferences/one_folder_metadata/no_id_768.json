{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper discusses enhancement of TEI-encoded texts with RDF and OAC annotations and transforming to other representations, and how to facilitate their production, editing and storage. Our case study is SAWS (Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project). SAWS produces TEI editions with semantic annotations in RDF to investigate links as Linked Data. This has the potential to be used widely to link and describe related texts. Links can be extracted and transformed for manipulation and searching using alternative methods, illustrated by our TEI-to-RDF XSLT. The TEI-editing process may present barriers for non-technical users. Islandora repository management software helps create and manage documents through intuitive, GUI-driven interactions with Fedora repositories. Within Islandora, the Digital Humanities Solution Pack provides a WYSIWIG interface to create, edit and annotate TEI documents. We demonstrate how TEI can be developed using Linked Data and RDF, and how Linked-Data-enhanced TEI documents can be facilitated using the DH Solution Pack.", "article_title": "Contemporary solutions to retrieve and publish information in ancient documents using RDF and Islandora", "authors": [{"given": "Charlotte", "family": "Tupman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Anna", "family": "Jordanous", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Alan", "family": "Stanley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Prince Edward Island, Canada", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["ontologies", "sustainability and preservation", "philosophy", "cultural studies", "repositories", "semantic web", "medieval studies", "archives", "scholarly editing", "xml", "text analysis", "interface and user experience design"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
