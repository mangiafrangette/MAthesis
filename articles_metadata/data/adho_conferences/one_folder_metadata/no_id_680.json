{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Dream of the Red Chamber (DRC), written in the 18th century, is among the greatest Chinese classic novels. DRC has 120 chapters. In 1921, Hu Shi (胡適) provided solid evidence to show that the first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin (曹雪芹) based on his life. He also attributed the remaining 40 chapters to Gao E (高鶚). While the first conclusion is commonly accepted, the second is still not settled. In this paper we propose a text-mining approach to the DRC author attribution problem. We define a mining function to find terms that clearly show discrepancies between the two corpuses (Chapters 1-80 and Chapters 81-120). Some of the terms are semantic in nature, thus avoiding the pitfalls with the more syntactic function words approach. Our result supports the claim that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 were written by different authors.", "article_title": "A Text-Mining Approach to the Authorship Attribution Problem of Dream of the Red Chamber", "authors": [{"given": "Hsieh-Chang", "family": "Tu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Taiwan University, CSIE Department, Taiwan, Republic of China", "normalized_name": "National Taiwan University", "country": "Taiwan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bqach95", "GRID": "grid.19188.39"}}]}, {"given": "Jieh", "family": "Hsiang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Taiwan University, CSIE Department, Taiwan, Republic of China", "normalized_name": "National Taiwan University", "country": "Taiwan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bqach95", "GRID": "grid.19188.39"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["authorship attribution / authority", "data mining/ text mining"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
