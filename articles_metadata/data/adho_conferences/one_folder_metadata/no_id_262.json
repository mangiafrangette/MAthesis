Published in Paris between 1751 and 1772, in 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates, it contains 74,000 articles written by more than 140 contributors.The ARTFL implementation of the Encyclopédie is discussed in Robert Morrissey, Jack Iverson and Mark Olsen, \"Présentation: L'Encyclopédie Electronique\" Robert Morrissey and Philippe Roger, eds.,  L'Encyclopédie de réseau au livre et du livre au réseau, (Paris: Champion, 2001): 17-27, and Leonid Andreev, Jack Iverson and Mark Olsen, \"Re-engineering a War Machine: ARTFL's Encyclopédie\"  Literary & Linguistic Computing 14.1 (1999): 11-28.The Encyclopédie was a massive reference work for the arts and sciences, as well as a machine de guerre which served to propagate Enlightenment ideas. The impact of the Encyclopédie was enormous. Through its attempt to classify learning and to open all domains of human activity to its readers, the Encyclopédie gave expression to many of the most important intellectual and social developments of its time.The scale and ambition of the Encyclopédie inspired its editors to adopt three distinct modes of organization which, taken together, Diderot described as encyclopedic: dictionary, hierarchical classification, and the renvois (cross-references). The interaction of these three modes has led modern commentators to describe the Encyclopédie as an \"ancestor of hypertext\" and to depict Diderot as \"l'internaute d'hier\"Eric Brian, \"L'ancêtre de l'hypertexte\", Les Cahiers de Science et Vie 47 (Oct. 1998): 28-38.. D'Alembert underscores the importance of the organization of knowledge in the Discours Préliminaire:  As an Encyclopedia, it is to set forth the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art ... and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.English translation cited in Nelly Hoyt and Thomas Cassier's \"Introduction\" to Encyclopedia (1965): xxiii (our emphasis). Of the three modes of organization, the dictionary mode (organization of entries in alphabetical order) is certainly the simplest and the most arbitrary. The second mode of organization is classification, wherein each dictionary entry is assigned to a \"class of knowledge,\" placing it within the \"order\" of human understanding, as depicted in the Système Figuré des connaissances humaines. Modeled after Bacon's classification of knowledge and Enlightenment theories of epistemology, all understanding is founded upon memory, reason, or imagination, with numerous categories and sub-categories branching out from these three faculties.For various representations of the Système Figuré and the Editors' description, see  and . However, simply placing an entry into this hierarchy of knowledge was insufficient to indicate the interconnections of knowledge. Thus, Diderot created an extensive system of renvois, the third mode of organization, providing a lattice of interconnections between individual leaves of the tree as well as between classes of knowledge.Blanchard and Olsen examined the structure of the renvois generating a \"mappemonde\" of the cross-references and node level classes of knowledge. See Gilles Blanchard and Mark Olsen, \"Le système de renvois dans l'Encyclopédie: une cartographie de la structure des connaissances au XVIIIème siècle\",  Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie 31-32 (April 2002): 45-70.The central role of the classification system in the intellectual objectives of the Encyclopédie editors is indicated by the extent to which it has been discussed and debated by both contemporaneous scholars and later researchers. The editors were remarkably diligent in assigning classes of knowledge to each article and sub-article. Of the 73,840 main and sub articles, 55,227 were assigned classes of knowledge. The editors were, however, somewhat less diligent in maintaining a precisely controlled list. Thus the classifications as found in the text are an amalgam of abbreviations, conflations, and even entries that are not found on the Système Figuré. We have recently completed orthographic normalization of the classes of knowledge assigned to each article,This project was accomplished in collaboration with Professor Dena Goodman at the University of Michigan.\" resulting in some 54,289 articles with 2,600 normalized classes of knowledge. The twenty most frequent classifications by number of articles are:5513 Géographie4794 Géographie moderne3084 Géographie ancienne2396 Jurisprudence2304 Grammaire1894 Marine1483 Commerce1277 Histoire naturelle.

Given the assumptions that ontologies are historically contingent and that the Encyclopédie is by far the most consistent and coherent representation of the structure of 18th century knowledge in French, this paper reports the results of our current experiments using machine learning and data mining techniques to understand and exploit this unique resource. Our initial objectives are three-fold. First, we plan to examine the relationship of the classifications to the content of the articles using machine learning techniques to identify feature sets that characterize classes of knowledge in the 55,000 articles classified by the editors of the Encyclopédie. Secondly, we will apply these feature sets to the 19,500 articles for which we do not have a class of knowledge and evaluate the accuracy of classification by randomly selecting articles with known authors which scholars will then inspect. Most contributors to the Encyclopédie worked on fairly specific domains -- Rousseau contributed exclusively on music, for example -- so we can use authorship as one control for judging the accuracy of classification. Similarly, the cross-references will also serve as an evaluation control, since 50% of the renvois link to articles within the same class of knowledge. Finally, we plan to apply these feature sets to the unclassified \"plate legends\" in an effort to determine accuracy by examining the degree to which classification of the plate legends reflects the relationship of particular plate legends to particular articles.For our initial experiments, we have extracted the text from all articles that are more than 100 words in length, and which are categorized within one of the 50 most frequent normalized classifications. Explicit markers of class of knowledge, present at the beginnings of these articles, were removed to ensure that they do not provide facile criteria for classification. The texts are tokenized and lemmatized, and frequencies of words and lemmas are computed both globally and for each article. Words and lemmas with more than 100 occurrences in the entire Encyclopédie were used as attributes, and vectors for each article were generated from the number of occurrences of each attribute in that article.We are using the SMO implementation of a support vector machine in the WekaIan H.

While support vector learning algorithms are very effective for classification problemsS. Dumais, et. al., \"Inductive learning algorithms and representations for text categorization\",  CIKM-98, 1998., we are also evaluating several other data metrics and machine learning techniques, including information gain statistics and J48 decision tree classification as implemented in Weka, to examine the the most salient features that are used in the classification process and to test the effectiveness of various feature set selections.See the discussion conformity and uniformity in Chih-Ming Chen, et. al. \"A Hierarchical Neural Network Document Classifier with Linguistic Feature Selection\"  Applied Intelligence 3 (December 2005).Results from preliminary experimentation indicate that SVM classifiers applied to the articles of the Encyclopédie are very effective at distinguishing articles from different classes. We examined 936 unlemmatized articles in our sample dataset belonging to the classes Medecine (499) and Mythologie (437). The Weka SMO classifier using default options with 10-fold cross-validation correctly recognized 98.29% of the articles (920/936). Under the same parameters, the Weka J48 tree classifier achieved slightly lower performance (91.66% accuracy). The decision tree showed a clear split on medical content words, such as maladie, humeurs, inflammation, and so on. Such strong performance may be due to the fact that one would not expect to find similar vocabularies in articles dealing with medicine and mythology. We achieved similar performance by classifying 2,448 articles equally divided between modern and ancient geography. The SMO training achieved 100% accuracy with 92.2% accuracy on cross-validation. Inspection of the most important features in both J48 tree and InfoGain measures shows a strong preference for classical authors (Pline, Ptolomée) and places (Gaule, Thrace), and the strings \"l\", \"lib\" and \"liv\", which correspond to citations of classical authors (e.g. Pline, l. IV. c. xvj.).We checked these using the PhiloLogic build of the  Encyclopédie (), suggesting the importance of checking text mining results with full text analysis systems. Distance and location terms (lieues, long., latit.) are strongly correlated with modern geography. Furthermore, the function words \"selon\" and \"dit\", which are far more prevalent in ancient geography articles as the authors were citing classical descriptions, are given high InfoGain scores. We anticipate assigning classes of knowledge to articles that were not originally classified by the editors iteratively by comparing all unknown articles to specific classes of knowledge rather than trying to classify all unknown articles en masse. To test this approach, we assembled two sets of articles each containing 1,209 instances. The first set contained articles categorized by the editors as belonging to ancient geography, while the second set was constituted by selecting, for each article in the first set, an article as close as possible in length but belonging to a different class of knowledge. Using SMO training, we achieved 97.8% accuracy with standard 10-fold cross-validation. Again, the most heavily weighted features were terms denoting classical authors and place names, along with a greater preponderance of more general geographic terms, comporting nicely with a reasonable human's intuitive understanding of what makes a document on ancient geography distinct from another documents. We further validated our results by running another experiment identical to the first except that each article was randomly labeled as either ancient geography or not ancient geography, irrespective of its true classification. The principle of Random Falsifiability states that if random labels can be learned with the same ease (for SVM, 'ease' can be defined as proportion of support vectors required A. Ruiz and P.E. López-de-Teruel, \"Random Falsifiability and Support Vector Machines\" ().) as true class labels, the method must be rejected as unreliable. After 10-fold cross-validation, SMO achieved a mere 50.2895% accuracy on the classification, barely surpassing random chance. That our method cannot learn the random labels at all suggests that our success in discrimination is in fact based on inherent differences between the two classes and not merely a greedy model's exploitation of arbitrary patterns in the data distribution.The SMO model derived from comparing ancient geography to a random selection of articles in other classes allows us to test classification on a set of unclassified articles. To do this, we assembled 5,000 randomly selected articles containing more than 100 words for which classification was unknown and with attributed authorship. We then applied the ancient geography SMO model to this set in an effort to identify articles pertaining to this category. The recall of this experiment was far too high. In the future we intend to implement a classifier that reports a numeric score rather than a simple binary categorization. There were, however, within the results a number of correctly classified articles such as the river ASOPE and the articles GARAMANTESand Ionique Transmigration. Many of the misclassified articles, such as ADONIES, ou FESTES ADONIENNES and Danse astronomique, pertain to classical history, mythology and other related fields. In addition to implementing a ranking classifier, we will also investigate moving up the tree of knowledge in order to use a coarser classification scheme; e.g., rather than remaining at the leaves of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" geography, we would use the branch of geography itself as a general category. The impressive performance of machine learning algorithms suggests that the editors of the Encyclopédie were quite judicious in their assignments of classifications, a claim which will be tested further in the full paper. Examination of the features most effective in classification tasks will establish a sort of thesaurus which will give scholars a better understanding of the organization of knowledge during the Englightenment. Furthermore, we believe that the creation of well-verified training sets on this large corpus will allow us to test the degree to which we may profitably apply what the systems have learned to articles and plate legends which were not classified at the time, using the contemporary ontologies. If this series of experiments is successful, we would anticipate using the training sets from the classifications in the Encyclopédie to attempt to classify passages in other 18th century French documents.", "article_title": "Mining Eighteenth Century Ontologies: Machine Learning and Knowledge Classification in the Encyclopédie", "authors": [{"given": "Russell ", "family": "Horton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Library Development CenterUniversity of Chicago", "normalized_name": "University of Chicago", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024mw5h28", "GRID": "grid.170205.1"}}]}, {"given": "Robert ", "family": "Morrissey", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ARTFL ProjectUniversity of Chicago", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Mark ", "family": "Olsen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ARTFL ProjectUniversity of Chicago", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Glenn ", "family": "Roe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ARTFL ProjectUniversity of Chicago", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Robert ", "family": "Voyer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ARTFL ProjectUniversity of Chicago", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2007", " keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
