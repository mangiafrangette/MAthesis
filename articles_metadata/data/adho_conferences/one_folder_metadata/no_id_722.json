We extract and build character interaction networks in the form of weighted graphs from a database of scripts, compute various informative properties from the resulting networks (e.g. clustering coefficient), and construct logistic regression and decision tree classifiers based on these properties that distinguish between a multitude of characteristics that define movies and plays, such as media type, publication date, and genre. Finally, we discuss the successes and failures of using automated classification for specific characteristics on such limited input and strive to formulate intuitive explanations of the results.", "article_title": "Extraction and Analysis of Character Interaction Networks From Plays and Movies", "authors": [{"given": "Caroline", "family": "Suen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stanford University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Stanford University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f54p054", "GRID": "grid.168010.e"}}]}, {"given": "Laney", "family": "Kuenzel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stanford University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Stanford University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f54p054", "GRID": "grid.168010.e"}}]}, {"given": "Sebastian", "family": "Gil", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stanford University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Stanford University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f54p054", "GRID": "grid.168010.e"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "networks", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling", "film and cinema studies", "graphs", "relationships"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
