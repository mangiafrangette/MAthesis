In this study, we use the database with 578,617 words $2 as being processed for morphological analysis to all sentences of Saikaku's 24 works on the basis of \"Shinpen Saikaku Zenshu\". This database was developed in cooperation with the editor of \"Yorozu no fumihougu \" at the affiliate laboratory. The database is the only database to be able to analyze Saikaku's works at present and has a high degree of reliability from a viewpoint of Japanese language and literature.
