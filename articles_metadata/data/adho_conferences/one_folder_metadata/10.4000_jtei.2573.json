However, schemas can also help us write our documents. The TEI ODD language (and the more modern version thereof, Pure ODD), in particular, can be used for two related but distinctly different purposes: 1) to create a markup language, including documentation and schemas; and 2) to customize a markup language that was already written in ODD. There are several examples of (1), including the TEI Guidelines, the Music Encoding Initiative, the ISO Feature Structure encoding system, and the W3C Internationalization Tag Set. And there are several well known examples of (2), including TEI Lite, TEI Tite, TEI Simple Print, Comic Book Markup Language, Digital Humanities Quarterly, TEI-in-Libraries, and the markup language for this journal.1 ", "article_title": "A TEI Customization for Writing TEI Customizations", "authors": [{"given": "Syd", "family": "Bauman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Northeastern University, Digital Scholarship Group", "normalized_name": "Universidad del Noreste", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ahky613", "GRID": "grid.441462.1"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2020", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 12", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
