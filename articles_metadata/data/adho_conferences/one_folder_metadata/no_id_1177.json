{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Saikaku Ihara (c. 1642–1693 ) is one of the most famous writers of the Edo period (1603–1868) in Japan. 1 After publishing the maiden works of  Kousyoku ichidai otoko (The Life of an Amorous Man, 1682), he became the leading author of  Ukiyozoushi, 2 which was a realistic literature from the Edo period. Saikaku’s works are known for their significance in developing Japanese novels today (Emoto and Taniwaki, 1996).   It is said that he wrote 24 works in 10 years. However, with the exception of  Kousyoku ichidai otoko, those achievements have not been fully verified, due to some doubts in their authorship. For instance, Saikaku only wrote  Kousyoku ichidai otoko, while the other works were written by either Saikaku’s student Dansui Houjyou (1663–1711) or a collaboration of Dansui and Saikaku (Mori, 1955).  Saikaku researchers have tried to identify his works by investigating their history, content, format, and so on. However, it remains unclear which works are really written by Saikaku. Accordingly, we decided to use a quantitative approach to inspect Saikaku’s authorship problems, because the potential of quantitative analysis of textual data has dramatically advanced. That method can provide new knowledge about the authorship problem of Saikaku’s works. Moreover, this research will be a good example in using a quantitative approach for the Japanese classical literature research domain because the quantitative approach is not common in that domain.  Purpose of This Study In this paper, we focus on Saikaku’s posthumous works because many of Saikaku’s researchers have raised questions about their authorship. Saikaku’s posthumous works were edited and published from 1693 to 1699 by his student Dansui (Table 1). Therefore, there are claims that Dansui may have modified Saikaku’s work.  We have compared Saikaku’s posthumous works and other Saikaku works for differences (Uesaka and Murakami, 2013; 2014). If we try to resolve the authorship problems of Saikaku, Dansui is the most suspect writer of Saikaku’s work; therefore, Dansui’s text should be analyzed also.  Database of Saikaku’s Works  Since Japanese morphological analyzers are not applicable for early modern Japanese texts (Ogiso et al., 2013), we developed a database of Saikaku’s works with his researchers, who are editors of  Shinpen Saikaku Zenshu (Shinpen Saikaku Zenshu Henshu Inkai, 2000). Figures 1 and 2 show a page from the book. Moreover, we used Dansui’s database for an analysis, which was developed by Banno and Mizutani, who are Saikaku and Dansui researchers, based on  Shinpen Saikaku Zenshu. In this research, we use  Shikidou otsuzumi (1687),  Chuya youjin ki (1707), and  Budou hariai okagami (1709) , because these works’ digital text and database were finished developing.

Table 2 shows a list of works in our database and the number of words in each work. According to our database, there are 583,934 words contained in 24 of Saikaku’s works and 55,504 words contained in three of Dansui’s works.       Table 2. Work name and the number of words. Table 3 is a part of the database from Saikaku’s works used for this analysis. Since Japanese sentences are not separated by spaces, we added spaces between the words in all of the sentences. In addition, information was added for the analysis.        Table 3. Database of Saikaku’s works.  Analysis and Results  We compared Saikaku’s works ( Kousyoku ichidai otoko, which has been verified to be a work of Saikaku, and five posthumous works) to Dansui’s three works ( Shikidou otsuzumi,  Chuya youjin ki, and  Budou hariai okagami) using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA reduces the dimensionality of a dataset consisting of a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the dataset (Jolliffe, 2002). When applied to the frequencies of high-frequency items in texts, PCA often successfully reveals the authorial structure in a dataset (Kestemont et al., 2013).  At first, we examined the appearance rate of the seven principal grammatical categories: nouns, particles, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and adnominal adjectives. Grammatical categories were the basic information for authorship attribution. The study of  Tale of Genji (Murakami, 2002) and  Sandai hiho bonsyoji (Itou and Murakami, 1992) adopted the stylometry research using grammatical categories, and these help to identify the author.   Figure 3 shows the results of the analysis on grammatical categories, using the PCA with a correlation matrix. The horizontal axis shows the importance of the first principal component, and the vertical axis shows the second. The proportion of variance of the first principal component is 0.4031, while it is 0.29088 for the second; the cumulative proportion up to the second principal component is 0.69398. In this figure, indicating differences are revealed by PCA, Saikaku’s works are on the lower left and Dansui’s works on the upper middle.", "article_title": "A Quantitative Analysis for the Authorship of Saikaku’s Posthumous Works Compared with Dansui’s works", "authors": [{"given": "Ayaka", "family": "Uesaka", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Doshisha University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Doshisha University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01fxdkm29", "GRID": "grid.255178.c"}}]}, {"given": "Masakatsu", "family": "Murakami", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Doshisha University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Doshisha University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01fxdkm29", "GRID": "grid.255178.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Paul Arthur, University of Western Sidney", "date": "2015", "keywords": ["authorship attribution / authority", "English", "data mining / text mining"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
