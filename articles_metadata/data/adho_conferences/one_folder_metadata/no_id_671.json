While the use of crowdsourcing is increasing, little work has been done to understand ways to organize the work to ensure that this crowd’s contribution is delivered within an academic’s project’s schedule, budget and other resources and to the required quality standard. This paper will contribute to this discussion by reviewing the literature to suggest a crowdsourcing process framework explore the range of decisions that must be addressed in advance to ensure quality and successful project outcomes. In addition, it will report on interviews with several crowdsourcing projects with regards to their workflow organization. The paper will conclude with recommendations for projects contemplating this tool as a way to reach project outcomes with limited project funds.", "article_title": "The Crowdsourcing Process: Decisions about Tasks, Expertise, Communities and Platforms", "authors": [{"given": "Lynne", "family": "Siemens", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "interdisciplinary collaboration", "internet / world wide web", "project design", "management", "organization"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
