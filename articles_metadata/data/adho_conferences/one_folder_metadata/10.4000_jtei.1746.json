Before formally launching an open access journal publishing program in 2008, the Libraries collaborated with two scholarly journals to provide open access publishing using P3 SGML and P4 XML TEI encoding delivered through the DSpace and XTF platforms. Both journals used complex encoding, transformation, and delivery workflows that required copious amounts of custom software development to function properly. As these systems aged, the time and effort required to maintain them steadily increased. In 2013, the Libraries began planning to migrate these journals into the Open Journal Systems (OJS)1 platform while preserving the TEI markup.", "article_title": "Migrate, Publish, Repeat: TEI Journals in the Open Journal Systems Platform", "authors": [{"given": "Nicholas", "family": "Homenda", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University Bloomington Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Shayna", "family": "Pekala", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Georgetown University Library", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 10", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
