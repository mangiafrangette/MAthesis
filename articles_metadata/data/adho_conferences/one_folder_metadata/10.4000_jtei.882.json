Four students presented short papers to the TEI meeting that incorporated both the survey responses and their own perspectives as relative newcomers to TEI. These papers demonstrate why it is important to incorporate TEI in the graduate curriculum, how that incorporation might best be approached, and what happens when TEI is viewed through a disciplinary lens.", "article_title": "Encoding the Discipline: English Graduate Student Reflections on Working with TEI", "authors": [{"given": "Maura", "family": "Ives", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Victor Del", "family": "Hierro", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Bailey", "family": "Kelsey", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Laura Catherine", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Christina", "family": "Sumners", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 6", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
