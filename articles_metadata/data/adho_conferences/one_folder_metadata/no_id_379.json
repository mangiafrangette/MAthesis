{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Electronic text projects range in complexity from simple collections of page images to bundles of page images and transcribed text from multiple versions or editions (Haarhoff, Porter). To facilitate navigation within texts and across texts, an increasing number of digital initiatives, such as the Princeton University Library Digital Collections (http://diglib.princeton. edu/) and the Oxford Digital Library (http://www.odl.ox.ac. uk/), and cultural heritage organizations, such as the Culturenet Cymru (http://www.culturenetcymru.com) and the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/index.html), are relying on the complementary strengths of open standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) for describing, representing, and delivering texts online. The core purpose of METS is to record, in a machine-readable form, the metadata and structure of a digital object, including fi les that comprise or are related to the object itself. As such, the standard is a useful tool for managing and preserving digital library and humanities resources (Cantara; Semple). According to Morgan Cundiff, Senior Standards Specialist for the Library of Congress, the maintenance organization for the METS standard: METS is an XML schema designed for the purpose of creating XML document instances that express the hierarchical structure of digital library objects, the names and locations of the fi les that comprise those digital objects, and the associated descriptive and administrative metadata. (53) Similarly, the TEI standard was developed to capture both semantic (e.g., metadata) and syntactic (e.g., structural characteristics) features of a document in machine-readable form that promotes interoperability, searchability and textual analysis. According to the Text Encoding Initiative web site, the TEI standard is defi ned thusly: The TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange defi ne and document a markup language for representing the structural, renditional, and conceptual features of texts. They focus (though not exclusively) on the encoding of documents in the humanities and social sciences, and in particular on the representation of primary source materials for research and analysis. These guidelines are expressed as a modular, extensible XML schema, accompanied by detailed documentation, and are published under an opensource license. (“TEI Guidelines”) METS, as its name suggests, is focused more exclusively on metadata. While digital objects—such as a text, image, or video—may be embedded within a METS document, METS does not provide guidelines, elements and attributes for representing the digital object itself; rather, the aim of METS is to describe metadata about a digital object and the relationships among an object’s constituent parts. In sum, METS is datacentric; TEI is document-centric. In April 2006, the Indiana University Digital Library Program released a beta version of METS Navigator (http:// metsnavigator.sourceforge.net/), a METS-based, open source software solution for the discovery and display of multi-part digital objects. Using the information in the METS structural map elements, METS Navigator builds a hierarchical menu that allows users to navigate to specifi c sections of a document, such as title page, specifi c chapters, illustrations, etc. for a book. METS Navigator also allows simple navigation to the next, previous, fi rst, and last page image or component parts of a digital object. METS Navigator can also make use of the descriptive metadata in the METS document to populate the interface with bibliographic and descriptive information about the digital object. METS Navigator was initially developed at Indiana University (IU) for the online display and navigation of brittle books digitized by the IU Libraries’ E. Lingle Craig Preservation Laboratory. However, realizing the need for such a tool across a wide range of digital library projects and applications, we designed the system to be generalizable and confi gurable. To assist with the use of METS Navigator for new projects, a METS profi le, also expressed in XML, is registered with the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/standards/ mets/profi les/00000014.html). The profi le provides detailed documentation about the structure of the METS documents required by the METS Navigator application. Cantara reported in her brief article, “The Text-Encoding Initiative: Part 2,” that discussion of the relationship between the TEI and METS was a primary focus during the Fourth Annual TEI Consortium Members’ Meeting held in 2004 at Johns Hopkins University (110). The relationship between the standards was also a topic of discussion during the 2007 Members’ Meeting, and was specifi cally raised in Fotis Jannidis’ plenary entitled “TEI in a Crystal Ball.” Despite these discussions, the community is still lacking a welldocumented workfl ow for the derivation of METS documents from authoritative TEI fi les. We believe the TEI, if properly structured, can be used as the “master” source of information from which a full METS document can be automatically generated, facilitating the display of text collections in METS Navigator. The TEI, much like METS, provides a rich vocabulary and framework for encoding descriptive and structural metadata for a variety of documents. The descriptive metadata typically found in the TEI Header may be used to populate the corresponding components (descriptive metadata section) of a METS document. The embedded structural metadata that describe divisions, sections, headings and page breaks in a TEI document may be used to generate the structural map section of a METS document. Unlike the TEI, the METS scheme has explicit mechanisms in place for expressing relationships between multiple representations of the digital content such as encoded text fi les and page images. By integrating the TEIMETS workfl ow into METS Navigator, scholars and digital library and humanities programs can more easily implement online text collections. Further, the intersection between TEI and METS documents can provide the foundation for enhanced end-user exploration of electronic texts. The IU Digital Library Program as a result of enhancing the functionality and modularity of the METS Navigator software is also in the process of formalizing and integrating the TEIMETS workfl ow in support of online page turning. Our paper will trace the development of METS Navigator including the TEI-METS workfl ow, demonstrate the METS Navigator system using TEI-cum-METS documents, review METS Navigator confi guration options, detail fi ndings from recent user studies, and outline plans for current and future development of the METS Navigator.", "article_title": "Document-Centric Framework for Navigating Texts Online, or, the Intersection of the Text Encoding Initiative and the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard", "authors": [{"given": "John A.
