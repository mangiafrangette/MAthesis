{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper argues that the digital humanities should take the forefront for the creation and development of Open Educational Resources (OER). It takes as case studies three JISC funded projects at University College London (including DHOER: Digital Humanities Open Educational Resources) where each seeks to push the boundaries of open educational practice. To encourage open education requires a change in academic culture, the building of user communities to ensure sustainability, and importantly institutional support. By making our teaching resources openly and freely available to all, we spread our ideas and methodologies to the wider academic and research communities beyond DH. This paper will present the results of these projects, show why these issues are important, particularly to overcome possible skepticism of what we in DH do, and point the way forward to future initiatives and research possibilities.", "article_title": "Should the Digital Humanities be taking a lead in Open Access and Online Teaching Materials?", "authors": [{"given": "Simon", "family": "Mahony", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Ulrich", "family": "Tiedau", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "teaching and pedagogy", "copyright", "licensing", "digital humanities - pedagogy and curriculum", "Open Access"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
