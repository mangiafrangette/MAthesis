We have run years-long experiment to see how one might build an edition which is scholarly in a traditional sense, but which extends the editorial conversation into multiple pre-existing social media platforms including blogs, wiki discussion pages, dedicated Renaissance and early modern online community spaces, Skype-enabled interviews with our advisory group, and Twitter. The past two years of work suggests that some blend of intensive oversight and engagement with defined communities, along with a receptivity to spontaneously formed communities of affinity is necessary to effectively implement social scholarly production.", "article_title": "Building the Social Scholarly Edition: Results and Findings from A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript", "authors": [{"given": "Daniel James", "family": "Powell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Constance", "family": "Crompton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, University of British Columbia-Okanagan, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of British Columbia", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rmrcq20", "GRID": "grid.17091.3e"}}]}, {"given": "Ray", "family": "Siemens", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "internet / world wide web", "social media", "english studies", "scholarly editing", "publishing and delivery systems", "digital humanities - nature and significance", "renaissance studies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
