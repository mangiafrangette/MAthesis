While taking inspiration from popular manifestations of the web development, I turn to contemporary experimental literature as a means of grappling with the materiality of print and testing the limits of presentation semantics in web markup. This paper will present various web based prototypes of CSS styling to visualize Jonathan Safran Foerâ€™s decidedly print text $2 (2010). Through a combination of 2D and 3D transforms and animations, I will show the complexity of this evolving web standard. In short, the purpose of my paper will be to show how this critique can be leveraged to produced innovative methods of web development.", "article_title": "This is Not a Novel: Experimental Literature as Prototype", "authors": [{"given": "Aaron", "family": "Mauro", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria, Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "networks", "social media", "   ", "graphs", "relationships"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
