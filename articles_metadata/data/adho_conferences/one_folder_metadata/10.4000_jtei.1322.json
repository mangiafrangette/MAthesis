But the advent of mass digitization efforts involving simple scanning of pages and OCR called into question such a role for libraries in text encoding. This paper presents the results of a survey targeting library employees to learn more about text-encoding practices and to gauge current attitudes toward text encoding.", "article_title": "“Reports of My Death Are Greatly Exaggerated”: Findings from the TEI in Libraries Survey", "authors": [{"given": "Michelle", "family": "Dalmau", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Kevin", "family": "Hawkins", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of North Texas Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 8", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
