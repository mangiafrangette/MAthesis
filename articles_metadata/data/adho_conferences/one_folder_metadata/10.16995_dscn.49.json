It proposes that before we begin imposing a structure on our material of study, we need to discover the shape of the data as it presents itself in these materials. The design of this experiment is presented here, along with analysis of the results and their implication for the project, as well as some observations about the experiment and its implementation.", "article_title": "Investigative Tagging: Modelling the Early Modern Cabinet of Curiosities", "authors": [{"given": "Brent", "family": "Nelson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Univeristy of Saskatchewan", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
