Correctly encoded and exposed they create a framework to support resource discovery and navigation by following links between topics. This framework provides opportunities to visualise dense points of interconnection and, deployed across otherwise separate collections, can reveal unforeseen networks and associations. Thus approached, the creation and online delivery of digital texts moves from a digital library model with its goal as the provision of access, to a digital humanities model directed towards the innovative use of information technologies to derive new knowledge from our cultural inheritance. Using this approach the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) has developed a delivery system for its collection of over 2500 New Zealand and Pacic Island texts using TEI XML, the ISO Topic Map technology1 and innovative entity authority management. Like a simple back-of-book index but on a much grander scale, a topic map aggregates information to provide binding points from which everything that is known about a given subject can be reached. The ontology which structures the relationships between dierent types of topics is based on the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model2 and can therefore accommodate a wide range of types. To date the NZETC Topic Map has included only those topics and relationships which are simple, veriable and object based. Topics currently represent authors and publishers, texts and images, as well as people and places mentioned or depicted in those texts and images. This has proved successful in presenting the collection as a resource for research, but work is now underway to expand the structured mark-up embedded in texts to encode scholarly thinking about a set of resources. Topic-based navigable linkages between texts will include ‘allusions’ and ‘infl uence’ (both of one text upon another and of an abstract idea upon a corpus, text, or fragment of text).3 Importantly, the topic map extends beyond the NZETC collection to incorporate relevant external resources which expose structured metadata about entities in their collection (see Figure 1). Cross-collection linkages are particularly valuable where they reveal interdisciplinary connections which can provide fertile ground for analysis. For example the National Library of New Zealand hosts a full text archive of the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society containing New Zealand science writing 1868-1961. By linking people topics in the NZETC collection to articles authored in the Royal Society collection it is possible to discern an interesting overlap between the 19th century community of New Zealand Pakeha artists and early colonial geologists and botanists. In order to achieve this interlinking, between collections, and across institutional and disciplinary boundaries, every topic must be uniquely and correctly identied. In a large, full text collection the same name may refer to multiple entities,4 while a single entity may be known by many names.5 When working across collections it is necessary to be able to condently identify an individual in a variety of contexts. Authority control is consequently of the utmost importance in preventing confusion and chaos. The library world has of course long worked with authority control systems, but the model underlying most such systems is inadequate for a digital world. Often the identier for an entity is neither persistent nor unique, and a single name or form of a name is unnecessarily privileged (indeed, stands in as the entity itself). In order to accommodate our goals for the site, the NZETC created the Entity Authority Tool Set (EATS),6 an authority control system that provides unique, persistent, sharable7 identiers for any sort of entity. The system has two particular benets in regards to the needs of digital humanities researchers for what the ACLS described as a robust cyber infrastructure.8 Firstly, EATS enables automatic processing of names within textual material. When dealing with a large collection, resource constraints typically do not permit manual processing -- for example, marking up every name with a pointer to the correct record in the authority list, or simply recognising text strings as names to begin with. To make this process at least semi-automated, EATS stores names broken down (as much as possible) into component parts. By keeping track of language and script information associated with the names, the system is able to use multiple sets of rules to know how to properly glue these parts together into valid name forms. So, for example, William Herbert Ellery Gilbert might be referred to in a text by “William Gilbert”, “W. H. E. Gilbert”, “Gilbert, Wm.”, or a number of other forms; all of these can be automatically recognised due to the language and script rules associated with the system. Similarly Chiang Kai-shek, being a Chinese name, should be presented with the family name fi rst, and, when written in Chinese script, without a space between the name parts (蒋介石). Figure 1: A mention of Samuel Marsden in a given text is linked to a topic page for Marsden which in turn provides links to other texts which mention him, external resources about him and to the full text of works that he has authored both in the NZETC collection and in other online collections entirely separate from the NZETC. The ability to identify entities within plain text and add structured, machine-readable mark-up contributes to the growth of electronic text corpora suitable for the types of computational analysis oered by projects such as the MONK environment.9 This is, however, distinct from the problem of identifying substrings within a text that might be names, but that are not found within EATS. This problem, though signicant, does not fall within the main scope of the EATS system.10 Similarly, disambiguating multiple matches for the same name is generally best left to the determination of a human being: even date matches are too often problematic.11 Secondly, the system is built around the need to allow for an entity to carry sometimes confl icting, or merely dierent, information from multiple sources, and to reference those sources.12 Having information from multiple sources aids in the process of disambiguating entities with the same names; just as important is being able to link out to other relevant resources. For example, our topic page for William Colenso links not only to works in the NZETC collection, but also to works in other collections, where the information on those other collections is part of the EATS record. It is, however, barely sucient to link in this way directly from one project to another. EATS, being a web application, can itself be exposed to the net and act as a central hub for information and resources pertaining to the entities within the system. Since all properties of an entity are made as assertions by an organisation, EATS allows multiple such organisations to use and modify records without touching anyone else’s data; adding data harvesting to the mix allows for centralisation of information (and, particularly, pointers to further information) without requiring much organisational centralisation. One benefi t of this approach is handling entities about which there is substantial dierence of view. With topics derived from research (such as ideas and events) there are likely to be dierences of opinion as to both the identifi cation of entities and the relationships between them. For example one organisation may see one event where another sees two. To be able to model this as three entities, with relationships between them asserted by the organisations, a potentially confusing situation becomes clear, without any group having to give up its own view of the world. The EATS system can achieve this because all information about an entity is in the form of a property assertion made by a particular authority in a particular record (see fi gure 2). The technologies developed and deployed by the NZETC including EATS are all based on open standards. The tools and frameworks that have been created are designed to provide durable resources to meet the needs of the academic and wider community in that they promote interlinking between digital collections and projects and are themselves interoperable with other standards-based programs and applications including web-based references tools, eResearch virtual spaces and institutional repositories. Figure 2: The EATS objects and basic relationships Only once both cultural heritage institutions and digital humanities projects adopt suitable entity identiers and participate in a shared mapping system such as EATS, can there exist unambiguous discovery of both individual resources and connections between them. The wider adoption of this type of entity authority system will contribute substantially to the creation of the robust cyber infrastructure that will, in the words of the ACLS “allow digital scholarship to be cumulative, collaborative, and synergistic.”", "article_title": "Topic Maps and Entity Authority Records: an Effective Cyber Infrastructure for Digital Humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Jamie ", "family": "Norrish", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, New Zealand", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Alison ", "family": "Stevenson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, New Zealand", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
