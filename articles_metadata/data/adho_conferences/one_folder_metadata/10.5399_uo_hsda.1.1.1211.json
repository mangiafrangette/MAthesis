Lat. 3195. Giovanni’s traditional horizontal format allows for certain striking effects of collocation (as of 125-126) and for minimal page turns in canzoni; however, the vertical format of the sestinas and the vertical alignment of even-numbered verses in Petrarch’s own transcriptions of sonnets and canzoni suggest a gradually increasing sense of the possibilities of vertical format.", "article_title": "Rerum vulgarium fragmenta: From Manuscript to Print", "authors": [{"given": "Robert M.", "family": "Durling", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, Santa Cruz", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
