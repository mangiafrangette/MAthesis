The approach uses named entity recognition and similarity metrics, and will result in a new dataset which enables each project to integrate information from the other.", "article_title": "Practical Interoperability: The Map of Early Modern London and the Internet Shakespeare Editions", "authors": [{"given": "Martin", "family": "Holmes", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humanities Computing & Media Centre, University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Janelle", "family": "Jenstad", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["digitisation - theory and practice", "standards and interoperability", "xml", "natural language processing", "encoding - theory and practice", "maps and mapping", "linking and annotation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
