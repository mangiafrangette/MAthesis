{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The Middle English Grammar Project The Middle English Grammar Project (MEG), shared by the Universities of Glasgow and Stavanger, is working towards the description of Middle English orthography, morphology and phonology. MEG is among the fi rst attempts to span the gap between Jordan’s Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik: Lautlehre (1925) and now. Our aim is to combine the advances in Middle English dialectology in the latter half of the 20th century and the computing power currently available in the service of writing an up-to-date grammar of Middle English. Middle English dialects and dialectology The study of Middle English dialects took a giant leap forward by Angus McIntosh’s insight that Middle English texts represent distinct regional varieties in their spelling systems, and therefore the spelling variants of these texts could be studied in their own right and not merely as refl ections of the then speech systems, i.e. dialects (McIntosh 1963). This multitude of regional spellings arose when English had been replaced by French and Latin in all important aspects for nearly two centuries after the Norman Conquest: the reintroduction of English into literary and utilitarian registers from the thirteenth century onwards was not governed by any nationwide standard and thus English was written according to each scribe’s perception of the ‘correct’ spelling. McIntosh’s vision led to a project that grew into A Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English (LALME; 1986). Aims of MEG The Middle English Grammar project builds on the work of the LALME team and aims at producing a description of Middle English orthography, phonology and morphology, from 1100 to 1500. Here we use the term grammar in a wide, philological sense. Eventually, the grammar is meant as an replacement to Richard Jordan’s Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik: Lautlehre, and to provide a reference point for the students and scholars of Middle English in the form of a broad description of the Middle English usages accompanied by more specifi c county studies, and eventually also all the base material we accumulate for this task (Black, Horobin, and Smith 2002: 13). The Middle English Grammar: How? The fi rst task of MEG is to compile a corpus of Middle English texts localized in LALME. The corpus is called The Middle English Grammar Corpus, or MEG-C (the fi rst installment forthcoming 2007). Secondly, the corpus texts need appropriate lemmatization and annotation in order to be usable in the course of MEG. Linguistic data is collected by transcribing extracts from either the original manuscripts, or good-quality microfi lms. The prioritised material are the texts that were localized in LALME, although later texts that were not analysed for LALME will be taken into account as well. LALME covers years 1350-1450 (-1500); the material for the studies in 1100-1350 will be drawn from A Linguistic Atlas for Early Middle English (LAEME) (Laing and Lass, forthcoming 2007). The manuscript texts are represented by 3,000-word extracts (or in toto, if shorter), which should be suffi ciently for studies on orthography, phonology and morphology. The planned corpus will sample c. 1,000 texts, therefore the projected size of the corpus is 2.5-3 M words. The conventions of transcription have been derived from those of the LAEME and A Linguistic Atlas of Older Scots projects (LAOS), with certain modifi cations. The most important questions that have been addressed during the transcription process have been whether to emphasise fi delity to the original vs. wieldy transcripts, and should the transcripts offer an interpretative reading of the manuscript text rather than the scribe’s actual pen strokes. According to the principles chosen, the transcriptions attempt to capture the graphemic and broad graphetic details, but not necessarily each detail on the level of individual handwriting (Black, Horobin, and Smith 2002: 11). MEG-C: lemmatization, annotation, publication The second practical task is to lemmatize and to annotate the Corpus. Previous historical English corpora (Helsinki Corpus, Middle English Medical Texts) show the limitations the lack of lemmas set to the corpus user when tackling the variety of spellings attested to by Middle English texts. The lemmas in MEG-C will have an Oxford English Dictionary headword. There will also be another cue in the source language (the direct source languge before Middle English, usually Old English, French/Anglo-Norman or Latin). These two reference points on either side of Middle English will provide the user the means to search for occurrences of a lexical item even when the full range of spelling variation in Middle English is not known. As regards the annotation of words of a text, they are divided into bound morphemes and other spelling units (this system is partly derived from Venezky (1970)). Each word is divided into a word initial sequence containing Onset and Nucleus, and they are followed by a series of Consonantal and Vowel Spelling Units. Each spelling unit is also given the equivalents in the source language and in Present Day English, thus enabling the search for e.g. all the ME refl exes of OE [a:] or or the spelling variants in Middle English that correspond to Present Day English word initial spelling sh-. For the task of annotation and lemmatization the corpus is rendered into a relational database. The database plan has tables for different extralinguistic information, and the actual texts will be entered word by word, i.e. in the table for corpus texts, there will be one record for each word. The annotation plan we are intending to carry out should result in a corpus where one can search for any combination of extralinguistic factors and spelling units with reference points embedded in the actual Middle English texts and also in the source language and PDE spelling conventions. The fi rst installment of MEG-C will be published in 2007, containing roughly 30 per cent of the texts in the planned corpus in ASCII format. It will be on the Internet, accessible for anyone to use and download. Our aim with publication is two-fold: fi rstly, we will welcome feedback of any kind, and especially from scholars who know the texts well; secondly, we want to encourage and to see other scholars use the corpus.", "article_title": "The Middle English Grammar Corpus - a tool for studying the writing and speech systems of medieval English", "authors": [{"given": "Martti ", "family": "Mäkinen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Stavanger , Norway", "normalized_name": "University of Stavanger", "country": "Norway", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02qte9q33", "GRID": "grid.18883.3a"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
