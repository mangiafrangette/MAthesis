CanLit Guides began as a project to mobilize the massive digital archive (1959-2008) of the scholarly journal Canadian Literature. The Guides introduce undergraduate students to areas of scholarly and critical concern in the larger field of Canadian Literature and culture. The editors of Canadian Literature enabled graduate students to develop teamwork, research, teaching, and digital writing skills by employing them as developers, researchers, and writers. The project supports open access, scholarly collaboration, and the creation of new digital genres. As the project evolved, however, it became clear that getting a team of scholars to work on a hierarchized, or what we call \"asymmetric,\" collaboration between the editors and the graduate students, is particularly difficult, and can lead to issues of doneness and sprawl. Producing a collaborative and democratic workflow process enabled us to write a robust collection of guides in innovative digital genres. This paper pays particular attention to issues of authorship that come up with any collaborative digital writing project, and it discusses the complexities of the graduate student experience of working on a digital pedagogical development team.", "article_title": "Asymmetric Digital Collaboration and Collective Authorship: On Digital Genres and Writing Processes for CanLit Guides", "authors": [{"given": "Mike", "family": "Borkent", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Jamie", "family": "Paris", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
