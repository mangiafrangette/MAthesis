In this paper, I explore computational techniques for studying phonological parallelism in a single, sizable corpus of Biblical Hebrew poetry, namely the Book of Psalms. A technique for evaluating whether a given poem or section thereof contains a statistically anomalous clustering of a consonantal phoneme or group of consonantal phonemes is presented. This technique can be used to evaluate the legitimacy of a proposal concerning the artistic use of sound identified by a critical eye/ear, and it also forms the basis of software designed to analyze the entire corpus and present passages for the researcher to consider as possible examples of the artistic use of sound.", "article_title": "The Sounds of the Psalter: Computational Analysis of Phonological Parallelism in Biblical Hebrew Poetry", "authors": [{"given": "Drayton Callen", "family": "Benner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Chicago, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Chicago", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024mw5h28", "GRID": "grid.170205.1"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["genre-specific studies: prose, poetry, drama, cultural studies, data mining/ text mining", "philology", "theology", "stylistics and stylometry", "near eastern studies", "literary studies", "corpora and corpus activities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
