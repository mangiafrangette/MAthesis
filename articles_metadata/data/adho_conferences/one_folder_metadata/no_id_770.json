{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The purpose of the paper is to extend the findings and implications of a major research project that explores the relationship between quality and usefulness of digitized books at scale. The testbed for the research is the HathiTrust Digital Library, an international repository collaborative that is preserving and providing access to the output of large-scale book digitization projects, including those by Google, the Internet Archive, and a host of localized digitization programs. This paper is an explicit effort to foster a conversation on the impact of digital imaging at scale on humanities scholarship by marshaling empirical research data related to digitization error to characterize the strengths and limitations of digital surrogacy. The findings on page-image and volume-level error provide a foundation for assessing the impact of massive collections of digital book surrogates on the readability and hence the usefulness of digitized books in an online environment.", "article_title": "Surrogacy and Image Error: Transformations in the Value of Digitized Books", "authors": [{"given": "Paul", "family": "Conway", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Michigan, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Michiganâ€“Ann Arbor", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00jmfr291", "GRID": "grid.214458.e"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["digitisation - theory and practice", "sustainability and preservation", "repositories", "resource creation, and discovery", "archives", "digitisation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
