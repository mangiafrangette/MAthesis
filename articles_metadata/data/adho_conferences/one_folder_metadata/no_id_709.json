{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "*Noh* is a classical Japanese stage art involving singing and dancing accompanied by music. It is natural that the author’s preference is considerably revealed in the play, both in the texts and songs. The standard rhythm in Noh is _“Hira-nori,”_ in which the seven-and-five syllable meter, that is, 7+5=12 characters will correspond to eight beats(16 half-beats). A sentence is called _“Haritsu”_(broken rhythmically) if many phrases have extra syllables or have insufficient number of syllables compared with standard meter. In particular, the _“Kuse”_ part is the most important part in a Noh play and should be composed of _Haritsu_ sentences. We prepared more than 3000 phrases of the _Kuse_ data from over 70 Noh plays, and analyzed the data. We mainly studied the distribution of *Zeami’s Noh* plays among other plays. As we expected, the authorship was *well revealed* in the _Kuse_ part, and validated the power of multivaliate analysis.", "article_title": "Identifying the author of the Noh play by considering a rhythmic structure — Validating the application of multivariate analysis", "authors": [{"given": "Mito", "family": "Takahashi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Doshisha University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Doshisha University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01fxdkm29", "GRID": "grid.255178.c"}}]}, {"given": " Kana", "family": "Tezuka", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Doshisha University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Doshisha University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01fxdkm29", "GRID": "grid.255178.c"}}]}, {"given": "Tamaki", "family": "Yano", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Doshisha University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Doshisha University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01fxdkm29", "GRID": "grid.255178.c"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["music", "philology", "   ", "data mining/text mining", "text analysis", "bibliographic methods/textual studies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
