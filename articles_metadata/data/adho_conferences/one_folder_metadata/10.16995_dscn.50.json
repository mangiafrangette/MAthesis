In 2011, Touch Press released The Waste Land for iPad, an interactive tablet application showcasing T.S. Eliot's notorious 1922 poem The Waste Land. From an academic editorial standpoint, Touch Press's edition has some grave issues. From a popular standpoint, The Waste Land for iPad is successful and well-received. This article asks: How can the tenets of humanities design and scholarly editorial practice be reconciled with the priorities of those who are currently in charge of widespread development and dissemination of cultural content through digital means? By briefly analysing The Waste Land for iPad and contrasting findings to the author's own attempt at developing a digital literary application (Weird Fiction), this article juxtaposes popularity and precision, ethics and economics in the field of cultural production.", "article_title": "Considering The Waste Land for iPad and Weird Fiction as models for the public digital edition", "authors": [{"given": "Alyssa", "family": "Arbuckle", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
