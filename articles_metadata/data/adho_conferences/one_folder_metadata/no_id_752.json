They engage in it creating databases, corpora, digital editions, geographical information systems, research collections, digital libraries, project-specific markup and also crosswalks for heterogenous data collections. In light of this variety of activities it is interesting to note that there is no general theory of data modeling in the digital humanities. This paper seeks to ask, in a very preliminary way, what ideas could be part of a first outline of a general theory of data modeling in the humanities.", "article_title": "A concept of data modeling for the humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Fotis", "family": "Jannidis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Philologie, University of Würzburg, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Würzburg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fbnyb24", "GRID": "grid.8379.5"}}]}, {"given": "Julia", "family": "Flanders", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Women Writers Project, Brown University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Brown University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gq02987", "GRID": "grid.40263.33"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["knowledge representation", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling", "encoding - theory and practice", "digital humanities - nature and significance"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
