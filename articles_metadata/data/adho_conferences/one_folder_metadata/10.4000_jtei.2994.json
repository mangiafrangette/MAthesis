It also examines the challenges faced when teaching TEI in Spanish and takes into consideration two main issues: the still not well-defined DH curriculum in many Spanish-speaking countries and the different pedagogical approaches to the TEI depending on the learning context: face-to-face instruction, distance education, and the Foreign Language Classroom. It aims as well to raise awareness about the lack of basic pedagogical materials—tutorials or guidelines—devoted to TEI in Spanish, an obstacle that has hindered the growth of a TEI community of practice from Spain and Latin America. It also offers some strategies and new resources that could benefit the outreach and adoption of the TEI inside and outside the Spanish-speaking DH community, while facilitating a new TEI curriculum in a higher education context.", "article_title": "The Switchover: Teaching and Learning the Text Encoding Initiative in               Spanish", "authors": [{"given": "Susanna", "family": "Allés-Torrent", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Miami", "normalized_name": "University of Miami", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02dgjyy92", "GRID": "grid.26790.3a"}}]}, {"given": "Gimena del Rio", "family": "Riande", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Instituto de Investigaciones Bibliográficas y Crítica Textual (IIBICRIT-CONICET, Argentina)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Humanidades CAICYT Lab at the Centro Argentino de Información en Ciencia y Tecnología (CAICYT-CONICET)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA)", "normalized_name": "University of Buenos Aires", "country": "Argentina", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0081fs513", "GRID": "grid.7345.5"}}, {"original_name": "LINHD-UNED (Spain)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2020", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 12", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
