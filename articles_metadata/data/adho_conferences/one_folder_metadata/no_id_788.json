{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Bowker and Star (1999) warn of the shaping force of classification systems, of the power of their apparent naturalization as part of infrastructures and the consequences thereof. The rise of the semantic web and its grounding in the use of ontologies threatens to explode the scale of this issue. This paper explores the practical implications and theoretical limits of using ontologies, offering a survey of best practices and ongoing areas of active research. The survey shows that the process of ontology construction and integration in the semantic web does have the potential to restrict human thought. It is then argued that certain features of the semantic web make it possible to avoid this detrimental outcome but only if a critical mass of people---the community of humanists might be enough---actively use these features to keep the web a place of flexible ontologies and humane classification.", "article_title": "A Humanist Perspective on Building Ontologies in Theory and Practice", "authors": [{"given": "John Edward", "family": "Simpson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Susan", "family": "Brown", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta, Canada; University of Guelph, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Lisa", "family": "Goddard", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Memorial University, Canada", "normalized_name": "Memorial University of Newfoundland", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04haebc03", "GRID": "grid.25055.37"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["knowledge representation", "philosophy", "databases & dbms", "internet / world wide web", "semantic web", "digital humanities - nature and significance", "ontologies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
