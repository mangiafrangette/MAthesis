{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper presents advanced work on the adaptation of a visual analytics tool to triage an active and disorganized archaeological data collection, aggregated over decades. The tool provides aerial views of the collection’s structure and features rendered from metadata extracted, classified, and aggregated at different directory levels and presented as a treemap. Features such as data classes, directory and file names, dates and checksums can be analyzed to study the collection’s formation processes and establish priorities for archiving. While analysis of formation processes, viewed from a variety of scales and perspectives, is especially intuitive for archaeologists, these tools have wide application for any data collection both active and archived. Preliminary results and ongoing work as well as the wider implications for organizing humanities data are discussed.", "article_title": "Lost in the Data, Aerial Views of an Archaeological Collection", "authors": [{"given": "Maria", "family": "Esteva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, United States of America", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}, {"given": "Jessica A.", "family": "Trelogan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Classical Archaeology, University of Texas at Austin, United States", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}, {"given": "Weijia", "family": "Xu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, United States of America", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}, {"given": "Andrew J.", "family": "Solis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, United States of America", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}, {"given": "Nicholas E.", "family": "Lauland", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Liberal Arts Instructional Technologies Service, University of Texas at Austin, United States", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["sustainability and preservation", "repositories", "metadata", "archives", "archaeology", "visualisation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
