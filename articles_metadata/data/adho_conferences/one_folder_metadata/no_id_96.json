{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "  This paper describes an authorship, and more generally document classification, experiment on a difficult Dutch corpus of university writings. By measuring linguistic distances using a cross-entropy technique, a technique sensitive not only to the distributions of language features, but also to their relative intersequencing, classification judgments can be made with great sensitivity, significance, confidence, and accuracy. In particular, despite the designed difficulty of the Dutch corpus used, the technique was still able to reliably detect not only authorship, but also subtle features of register, topic, and even the educational attainments of the author. Authorship attribution has received significant attention in recent years as a testbed and touchstone for new theories of authorial markers and linguistic statistics; (Holmes, 1998) presents a brief historical outline of some major theories. One of the current front-runners, proposed in (Burrows, 1989), suggests that a strong cue to authorship can be gleaned from a principle components’ analysis (PCA) of the most common function words in a document. Like most statistical techniques, a scholar’s ability to apply this technique is limited by the usual features of sample size, sample representativeness, and test power. Another popular technique, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), may be able to distinguish among previously chosen classes, but as a supervised algorithm, it has so many degrees of freedom that the discriminants it infers may not be “clinically” significant. An alternative technique using measurements of cross-entropy (Wyner, 1996; Juola, 1997, 2003) might be a better tool under difficult circumstances because it is capable of extracting more information (and thus distinguish more readily) along perceptually salient lines from a given data set. The corpus studied by Baayen, Van Halteren, Neijt, and Tweedie (Baayen, et al. 2002) has been specifically developed to be a difficult problem in authorship attribution. This corpus consists of small writing samples taken from undergraduate students at the University of Nijmegen on carefully and closely controlled topics. Eight students, four first-year and four fourth-year, were asked to write nine essays (for a total of 72) on the same set of closely-specified topics. These topics included three samples of fiction (for example, a retelling of the fairy tale of “Roodkapje,” the Dutch equivalent of “Little Red Riding Hood”), three of argumentative writing, and three of descriptive writing. Document sizes varied from approximately 3600 to 7600 words. These documents were analyzed using cross-entropy and the results compared to analysis via PCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (Baayen et al., 2001) to see both what the appropriate dimensions of variation were, and whether or not authorship attribution was practical in this tightly controlled a setting. Analysis using function word PCA showed a marked lack of significant and useful results. Baayen et all found “no authorial structure,” although education level and to a lesser extent genre were separated. LDA also could not reliably identify author, and in most experiments performed at chance level. First, as expected, the overall cross-entropy distances showed an extremely strong ability to sort documents by topic (grouping all “Roodkapje” stories together, for instance). Statistical analysis, however, shows a strong (and significant) tendency to within-group homogeneity across all dimensions of interest : topic, genre, author, and even year in school. In particular, the average within-group distance, excluding identity measurements, is significantly less than the average without-group measurement. This holds true, irrespective of whether groups are defined by authorship (p < 0.000001), register (p < 10-15), or even education level (p < 0.0084). This suggests that cross-entropy can be usefully deployed to author identification in this corpus.  A further test revealed that, for every document in the corpus and for every pair of authors, a potential authorship dispute can be resolved approximately 73% of the time using cross-entropy. Furthermore, applying a fractionation technique to restrict attention to only the function words (Juola, 1998; Juola and Baayen, in preparation) could improve these results to 86% correct identification. This can be compared to a best published result of 82% obtained by Baayen et al. using an enhanced LDA model. Although the enhanced version of LDA performed substantially better, it should be noted, however, that LDA is a supervised technique, and itself makes strong assumptions about the nature of the authorial problem that make it unsuitable to exploratory, unsupervised study. Even when one restricts the samples to a mere 500 words each, analysis still yields 63% of the pairwise comparisons correctly made, better than any result using PCA or standard (unenhanced) LDA. These results improve upon principle components analysis and standard linear discriminant analysis, with remarkable economy of calculation. The improved performance can be attributed to information used by cross-entropy but not by word-frequency histograms, specifically in ordering and sequencing of (function) words. Function word PCA performs well by using the relative presence or absence of function words as a cue and/or proxy for idiosyncratic syntactic patterns. Cross-entropy can distinguish not only a difference in presence/absence, but also a difference in relative sequencing. This additional source of information can allow more reliable inferences to be drawn from corpora and more subtle distinctions to be made. In theory, the idea that sequencing is more distinguishing than “mere” presence or absence could be applied to almost any form of linguistic data and any task. Irrespective of what feature sets are eventually found to be informative for authorship attribution, it is to be expected that sequences of features will probably outperform unordered bags of features in making fine distinctions.
