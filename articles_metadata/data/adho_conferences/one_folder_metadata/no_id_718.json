{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "We present a browser based platform which allows the philologists to quickly enter metadata of historical correspondences in an adequate and simple manner. It supports unformatted data entry of the names of the senders and addressees by auto-completion based on external catalogues, e.g., the Deutsche Nationalbibliografie. Additional information which is automatically extracted from the catalogues helps the philologist identify uniquely the scholars. Moreover, the platform allows the philologist input the date of the letter in various formats, e.g., \"early January 1798\", \"Eastern 1770\", \"mid-April 1770\", \"15.-20.04.1770\". The conversion of the entry to an exact date or a period is automatically done by the system. After the date is entered, the system provides additional historical information on historical events (extracted from chronicals) that took place immediately before or immediately after that date.", "article_title": "Optimized platform for capturing metadata of historical correspondences", "authors": [{"given": "Martin", "family": "Andert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computer Science Department, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}, {"given": "Joerg", "family": "Ritter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computer Science Department, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}, {"given": "Paul", "family": "Molitor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computer Science Department, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["metadata", "scholarly editing", "interface and user experience design"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
