{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper examines prospects and limitations of citation studies in the humanities. We begin by presenting an overview of bibliometric analysis, noting several barriers to applying this method in the humanities. Following that, we present a novel online tool for extracting and classifying citations in the humanities. This tool uses both document layout recognition and natural language processing techniques to classify citations in three ways: frequency, location-in-document, and polarity (each described below). We compare these results with previous studies of humanities citations, as well as our own qualitative analysis of the documents, and explore further directions for this tool.", "article_title": "Citation studies in the humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Chris Alen", "family": "Sula", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Pratt Institute, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Pratt Institute", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/007m3p006", "GRID": "grid.262107.0"}}]}, {"given": "Matt", "family": "Miller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Pratt Institute, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Pratt Institute", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/007m3p006", "GRID": "grid.262107.0"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "networks", "bibliographic methods / textual studies", "natural language processing", "graphs", "relationships"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
