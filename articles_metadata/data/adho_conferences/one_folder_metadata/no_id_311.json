{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Historical manuscripts and printed maps of the pre-cadastral1 period show enormous differences in scale, precision and color. Less apparent are differences in reliability between maps, or between different parts of the same map. True, modern techniques in computer assisted cartography make it possible to measure very accurately such differences between maps and geographic space with very distinct levels of precision and accuracy. However differences in reliability between maps, or between different parts of the same map, are not only due to the accuracy measurement techniques, but also to their original function and context of (re-)use. Historical information about the original context of function and context of (re-)use can give us insight how to measure accuracy, how to choose the right points for geo-referencing and how to rectify digital maps. On the other hand computer assisted cartography enables us to trace and to visualize important information about mapmaking, especially when further historical evidence is missing, is hidden or is distorted, consciously or unconsciously. The proposed paper is embedded in the project: Paper and Virtual Cities, (subsidized by the Netherlands Organization for Scientifi c Research) that aims at developing methodologies that a) permit researchers to use historical maps and related sources more accurately in creating in digital maps and virtual reconstructions of cities and b) allow users to recognize better technical manipulations and distortions of truth used in the process of mapmaking.2 In this paper we present as one of the outcomes of this project a method that visualizes different levels of accuracy in and between designs and maps in relation to their original function to assess their quality for re-use today. This method is presented by analyzing different 17th century designs, manuscript and engraved maps of the city of Leiden, in particular of the land surveyor, mapmaker Jan Pietersz. Dou. The choice for Leiden and Dou is no coincidence. One of the reasons behind differences the accuracy of maps is the enormous variety in methods and measures used in land surveying and mapmaking in the Low Countries.3 This variety was the result of differences in the private training and the backgrounds of the surveyors, in the use of local measures and in the exam procedures that differed from province to province.4 These differences would last until the 19th Century. However, already by the end of the 16th Century we see in and around Leiden the fi rst signs of standardization in surveying techniques and the use of measures.5 First of all, the Rhineland rod (3.767 meter) the standard of the water-administration body around Leiden is used more and more, along local measures in the Low Countries and in Dutch expansion overseas. A second reason to look at Leiden in more detail is that in 1600 a practical training school in land surveying and fortifi cation would be founded in the buildings of its university, the so-called Duytsche Mathematique, that turned out to be very successful not only in the Low Countries, but also in other European countries. This not only contributed to the spread and reception of the Rhineland rod, but also to the dissemination of more standardized ways of land surveying and fortifi cation.6 The instructional material of the professors of this training school and the notes of their pupils are still preserved, which allows us to study the process of surveying and mapmaking in more detail. The reason to look into the work of Jan Pietersz. Dou is his enormous production of maps. Westra (1994) calculated that at least 1150 maps still exist.7 Of the object of our case study alone, the city of Leiden, Dou produced at least 120 maps between 1600 and 1635, ranging from property maps, designs for extensions of the city and studies for civil engineering works etc. We will focus on the maps that Dou made for the urban extension of the city of Leiden of 1611. Sometimes these (partial) maps were made for a specifi c purpose; in other cases Dou tried in comprehensive maps, combining property estimates and future designs, to tackle problems of illegal economic activities, pollution, housing and fortifi cation. Since these measurements were taken in his offi cial role of, sworn-in land surveyor we can assume that they were supposed to be accurate. This variety in designs and maps for the same area allows us to discuss accuracy in relation to function and (re- )use of maps. We will also explain that the differences between designs and maps require different methods of geo-referencing and analysis. In particular, we will give attention to one design map of Dou for the northern part of the city of Leiden RAL PV 1002- 06 (Regionaal Archief Leiden) to show how misinterpretation of features lead to unreliable or biased decisions when the historical context is not taken into account, even when we can consider the results, in terms of accuracy, satisfactory. Since Dou later also made maps for commercial purposes of the same northern extension of Leiden it is interesting to compare these maps. Conclusions are drawn addressing the question of whether Dou used the same measurements to produce a commercial map or that he settled for less accuracy given the different purpose of the later map compared to his designs and property maps. To answer this question, we use modern digital techniques of geo-processing8 to compare the old maps to modern cartographical resources and to the cadastral map of the 1800s in order to determine how accurate the various maps in question are. We do this, by using the American National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) to defi ne accuracy at a 95% confi dence level. By point-based analysis we link distributional errors to classifi ed features in order to fi nd a relationship between accuracy and map function.", "article_title": "The function and accuracy of old Dutch urban designs and maps.
