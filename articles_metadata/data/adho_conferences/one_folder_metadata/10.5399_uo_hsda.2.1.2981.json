A person who has grown up using the internet, whether for school or simply to play videogames, tends to extend and reproduce the same model of knowing in other instances. The internet replaces a linear and centralized model with a circular and diffused framework for self-learning that presents certain familiar limits: it demands speed or, at least, not pausing. The internet user is omnivorous, in a rush, and develops a memory that is limited to the short term. However, there are some positive aspects of circular learning that should be emphasized: the possibility of constructing personal paths, comparing different opinions, innovating, overcoming old disciplinary divisions, surmounting the drawbacks of linear learning that often lead to uncritical and purely molecular thinking.", "article_title": "Studiare dopo internet", "authors": [{"given": "Alberto", "family": "Sobrero", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universit√† La Sapienza di Roma", "normalized_name": "Sapienza University of Rome", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02be6w209", "GRID": "grid.7841.a"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
