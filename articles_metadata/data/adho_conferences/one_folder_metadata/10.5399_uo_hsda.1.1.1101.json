Lat. 3195 (Rvf), edited by Belloni, Brugnolo, Storey, and Zamponi to the new critical edition of Petrarch’s masterpiece by Giuseppe Savoca–are presented and discussed as introduction to reflections on the role that a hypertext project, such as the Oregon Petrarch Open Book initiated at the University of Oregon, may play in the return to philology as necessary tool of textual criticism and hermeneutics.", "article_title": "Return to Philology and Hypertext in and around Petrarch’s Rvf", "authors": [{"given": "Massimo", "family": "Lollini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Oregon", "normalized_name": "University of Oregon", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0293rh119", "GRID": "grid.170202.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
