{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper reports on the Lesbian and Gay Liberation in Canada (LGLC) project's use of TEI and RDF in the representation of the personhood. An infrastructure pilot project of the Canadian Research Writing Collaboratory (CWRC) at the University of Alberta, the LGLC project chronicles the events of the Canadian gay liberation movement from 1964 to 1975. After introducing the LGLC project, the issues that underpin our TEI encoding, and CWRC's extension of existing personographic records, we demonstrate the stakes in producing authority records for the online recuperation and discoverability of, in this case, Canadian gay and lesbian activism. The LGLC project contributes to existing online feedback, citation, and authority models in a manner that supports the LGBT community and improves online access to often overlooked histories. We offer our code and our data modeling principles as methods to overcome the limitations of extant authority records.", "article_title": "On Our Own Authority: Crafting Personographic Records for Canadian Gay and Lesbian Liberation Activists", "authors": [{"given": "Constance", "family": "Crompton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of British Columbia", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rmrcq20", "GRID": "grid.17091.3e"}}]}, {"given": "Michelle", "family": "Schwartz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ryerson University", "normalized_name": "Ryerson University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05g13zd79", "GRID": "grid.68312.3e"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["encoding â€” theory and practice", "sustainability and preservation", "repositories", "   ", "archives", "digitisation", "discovery", "gender studies", "resource creation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
