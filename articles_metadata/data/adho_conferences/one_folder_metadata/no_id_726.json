One of the fundamental challenges faced by the project is the development of an interoperable data model. In this paper we describe the projectâ€™s overall objectives and the ontology that we are using to support the AustESE Workbench. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of an integrated workbench as it relates to several case studies.", "article_title": "eResearch Tools to Support the Collaborative Authoring and Management of Electronic Scholarly Editions", "authors": [{"given": "Roger", "family": "Osborne", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Queensland, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}, {"given": "Anna", "family": "Gerber", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Queensland, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}, {"given": "Jane", "family": "Hunter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Queensland", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["scholarly editing", "ontologies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
