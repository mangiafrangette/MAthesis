This paper examines informal and formal communication channels used by members of the DH community to diffuse information and build communities. We analyze data from these communications to determine how these interactions connect DH community members at the individual, group, and institutional levels and across the DH landscape and helps answer the question: How does the socio-technical ecology connect or partition the landscape of the DH community? This work will apply multi-dimensional network analysis to data from Twitter, LLC and DHQ journals, DH-related NEH grants awards, the TEI-L and Humanist listservs, DH syllabi, and other sources, to paint a wider view of the connections among people, teams, institutions, and communication channels that make up the DH landscape.", "article_title": "Mapping DH through heterogeneous communicative practices", "authors": [{"given": "Timothy", "family": "Bowman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}, {"given": "Bradford", "family": "Demarest", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}, {"given": "Scott B.", "family": "Weingart", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}, {"given": "Alicia", "family": "Simpson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Wheaton College (Norton, MA) United States of America", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Grant Leyton", "family": "Neal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}, {"given": "Vincent", "family": "Lariviere", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Montréal, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0161xgx34", "GRID": "grid.14848.31"}}]}, {"given": "Mike", "family": "Thelwall", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Wolverhampton, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Wolverhampton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k2y1055", "GRID": "grid.6374.6"}}]}, {"given": "Cassidy R.", "family": "Sugimoto", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["networks", "   ", "digital humanities — nature and significance", "relationships", " graphs"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
