This paper will therefore outline how establishing a relationship between digital and literary text leads us to reconsider the mediality of literary text and what this reconceptualization of text shows us in terms of parallels between digital and literary text, in particular with regard to movement production. The novel, Océan mer (OM), by Alessandro Baricco (1998), will be used to illustrate our view.", "article_title": "Mouvement et relations intermédiales, du numérique au texte littéraire", "authors": [{"given": "Élisabeth", "family": "Routhier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0161xgx34", "GRID": "grid.14848.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
