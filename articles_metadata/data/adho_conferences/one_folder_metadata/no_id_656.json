In the fields of ecology, economics, and political science, ABM has been used to show how the behaviors of individual entities collectively alter large emergent phenomena. ABM offers a promising new way to approach long-standing humanistic questions, such as how literary genres change over time, how publics form and transform, or how consumer markets influence authors.", "article_title": "Agent-Based Modeling and Historical Simulation", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Gavin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of South Carolina, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of South Carolina", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02b6qw903", "GRID": "grid.254567.7"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["spatio-temporal modeling", "networks", "historical studies", "agent modeling and simulation", "english studies", "analysis and visualisation", "media studies", "literary studies", "relationships", "graphs", "virtual and augmented reality", "renaissance studies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
