But what we lack currently are better ways to integrate these forms of digital surrogate. Image-based electronic editions were proposed some years ago as a way to link sections of images to sections of corresponding text. The AustESE (Australian electronic scholarly editing) project aims - among other things - to develop interoperable tools for viewing, editing and storing such links in a reusable and shareable way. The TILT tool is a Java applet that can create text-image links and automate the process on several levels: by auto-recognising lines and words on print and manuscript pages even when they are tilted or wavy, and by auto-selecting the corresponding text simultaneously. This would enable the rapid creation of text-image link data and make image-based electronic editions more practical.", "article_title": "Text to Image Linking Tool (TILT)", "authors": [{"given": "Desmond", "family": "Schmidt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Queensland, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["encoding — theory and practice", "digitisation, resource creation, and discovery", "scholarly editing", "digitisation — theory and practice", "linking and annotation", "image processing"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
