It will also consider TEIâ€™s potential role in the design of these environments, these representations, and these tools.  The argument of the piece is that interoperability is a process as well as a state, that it requires mechanisms that would sustain it, and that TEI is one of those mechanisms.", "article_title": "Computational Work with Very Large Text Collections", "authors": [{"given": "John", "family": "Unsworth", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "normalized_name": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047426m28", "GRID": "grid.35403.31"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
