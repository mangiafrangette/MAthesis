We will demonstrate that digital forensics offers researchers an advanced community of practice around the acquisition, processing, management, and analysis of born-digital objects, and we will suggest that as humanities scholars increasingly engaged with objects of born-digital cultural heritage, digital forensics will emerge as a significant modality within DH. Finally, we will argue that digital forensics offers an especially fruitful area for collaborative research and project development between digital humanities and the digital archives community.", "article_title": "\"Shall These Bits Live?\" Towards a Digital Forensics Research Agenda for Digital Humanities with the BitCurator Project", "authors": [{"given": "Matthew", "family": "Kirschenbaum", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "MITH Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, University of Maryland, United States of America", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Cal", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0130frc33", "GRID": "grid.10698.36"}}]}, {"given": "Kam", "family": "Woods", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0130frc33", "GRID": "grid.10698.36"}}]}, {"given": "Alex", "family": "Chassanoff", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0130frc33", "GRID": "grid.10698.36"}}]}, {"given": "Porter", "family": "Olsen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "MITH Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, University of Maryland, United States of America", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Sunitha", "family": "Mithra", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0130frc33", "GRID": "grid.10698.36"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["sustainability and preservation", "bibliographic methods / textual studies", "repositories", "archives", "literary studies", "digital humanities - nature and significance"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
