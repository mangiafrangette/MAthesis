The main aim is to find out whether the characters in the novels are distinguishable as to their writing style. An additional question is whether the two co-authors of three of the novels can be identified in the letters of certain fictional characters. The method used is stylometric authorship attribution by means of an R-script developed by Eder, Rybicki and added to by Kestemont.", "article_title": "Epistolary voices.
