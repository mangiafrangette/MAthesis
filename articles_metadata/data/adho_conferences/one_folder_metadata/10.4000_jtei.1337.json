Unlike XML, LMNL markup does not represent document components or constituents (as “elements”) within a structure, but rather simply labels ranges of text within the document for identification and processing. Avoiding choices between structures, any and all structures can be elucidated; this reveals not only new capabilities for the digital processing of humanities texts—simultaneously building on TEI and extending it to new uses—but also something about the way our tools condition our view of our objects of study.", "article_title": "TEI in LMNL: Implications for Modeling", "authors": [{"given": "Wendell", "family": "Piez", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Rockville, Maryland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 8", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
