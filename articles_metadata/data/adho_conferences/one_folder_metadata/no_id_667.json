{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The University of Canterbury has recently completed development of New Zealand (and Australasia’s) first digital humanities degree program that is also standards-approved on a national level. The process required the development of document sets that were submitted for review by the University of Canterbury Faculty, Academic Advisory Committee, Academic Board, the New Zealand Vice-Chancellor’s Committee on University Academic Programs (CUAP), the New Zealand Vice-Chancellor’s Committee, and the Tertiary Education Commission. Fourteen national and international reviewers, drawn from technology education, information science, computer science, high performance computing and the digital humanities also provided their opinions. The program represents a significant baseline for future digital humanities programs, and the lessons learned during its development are of importance to the broader digital humanities community. It may be that the University of Canterbury digital humanities program is the most closely scrutinised example the digital humanities community have seen.", "article_title": "‘State of the Art’: Negotiating a National Standards-approved Digital Humanities Curriculum", "authors": [{"given": "James", "family": "Smithies", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Canterbury, New Zealand", "normalized_name": "University of Canterbury", "country": "New Zealand", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03y7q9t39", "GRID": "grid.21006.35"}}]}, {"given": "Paul", "family": "Millar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Canterbury, New Zealand", "normalized_name": "University of Canterbury", "country": "New Zealand", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03y7q9t39", "GRID": "grid.21006.35"}}]}, {"given": "Craig", "family": "Bellamy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "VERSI, Australia", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["digital humanities - pedagogy and curriculum", "digital humanities - nature and significance"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
