{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "All printed texts convey meaning through both linguistic and graphic signs, but existing tools for computational text analysis focus only on the linguistic content. Our VisualPage application will enable the large-scale identification and analysis of the graphical elements of digitized printed books, such as margin space, line indentation, and typeface attributes. This application will enable researchers to identify unique or representative examples across very large data sets of digitized texts. Such computational analysis will reveal new ways of thinking about both the printed book and its digitized forms. This paper presents the current development of our proof-of-concept VisualPage software and some findings from the analysis of our initial data set of 300 single-author books of poetry published between 1860-1880.", "article_title": "Reading the Visual Page of Victorian Poetry", "authors": [{"given": "Natalie M", "family": "Houston", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Houston", "normalized_name": "University of Houston", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/048sx0r50", "GRID": "grid.266436.3"}}]}, {"given": "Neal", "family": "Audenaert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Archives, Research & Technology Services (DARTS)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "bibliographic methods / textual studies", "literary studies", "text analysis", "software design and development", "image processing"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
