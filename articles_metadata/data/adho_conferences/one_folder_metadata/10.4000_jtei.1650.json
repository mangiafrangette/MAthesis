The DTABf is a TEI-subset for the consistent, yet unambiguous, annotation of large amounts of historical text. During our work on the DTA corpora, the DTABf has continuously been subject to further adaptations to specific annotation needs. The latest addition, the DTABf-M, contains elements, attributes, and values necessary for the annotation of (historical) handwritten documents. The goal is to provide a TEI format for diverse manuscripts in large text corpora.", "article_title": "Enabling the Encoding of Manuscripts within the DTABf: Extension and Modularization of the Format", "authors": [{"given": "Susanne", "family": "Haaf", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Christian", "family": "Thomas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 10", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
