Our paper concerns the development and achievement of the European project Agora: Scholarly Open Access Research in European Philosophy – http://www.project-agora.eu –. This project aims at improving the spread of European research results in the field of philosophy, while advancing new paradigms of Open Access (OA) publishing, peer-reviewing, and rendering thanks to the interlinking, connecting, and commenting of digital versions of primary sources (manuscripts, original printed editions, critical editions) and secondary literature (articles, monographs, audio and video contributions).", "article_title": "Scholarly Open Access Research in Philosophy: Limits and Horizons of a European Innovative Project.", "authors": [{"given": "Marras", "family": "Cristina", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Research Council: Institute for European Intellectual Lexicon and History of Ideas (CNR-ILIESI)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Lamarra", "family": "Antonio", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Research Council: Institute for European Intellectual Lexicon and History of Ideas (CNR-ILIESI)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["digitisation - theory and practice", "philosophy", "semantic web", "digital humanities - facilities", "ontologies"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
