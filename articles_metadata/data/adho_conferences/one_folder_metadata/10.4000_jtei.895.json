This possible system is expressed as a TEI “extension” customization, and is flexible enough to encode the subgenre of financial records called “double-entry accounts,” a bookkeeping method for recording transfers of goods or services in exchange for currency or credit.", "article_title": "Encoding Financial Records for Historical Research", "authors": [{"given": "Kathryn", "family": "Tomasek", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Wheaton College in Massachusetts", "normalized_name": "Wheaton College - Massachusetts", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/055ja0v85", "GRID": "grid.422659.e"}}]}, {"given": "Syd", "family": "Bauman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Northeastern University", "normalized_name": "Universidad del Noreste", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ahky613", "GRID": "grid.441462.1"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 6", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
