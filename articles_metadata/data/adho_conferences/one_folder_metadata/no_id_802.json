However social scientists and, more obviously, humanist scholars have questions concerning human experience of space and space-time. In recent years, GIScience has increasingly been adding methods more directly supporting qualitative analysis. I present an example from my own work integrating remote sensing imagery with demographic variables to create a measure of \"nature-ness\" —the human sense of being in a natural place, as a step towards explaining the enormous variation of the experience of nature within and across US cities.", "article_title": "Computing Place: The Case of City Nature", "authors": [{"given": "Karl", "family": "Grossner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stanford University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Stanford University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f54p054", "GRID": "grid.168010.e"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interfaces and technology", "geospatial analysis", "digital humanities — nature and significance", "maps and mapping", "image processing"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
