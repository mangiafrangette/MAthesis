An analysis of the survey results provides insights into the practices, problems, and limitations of the community utilizing the TEI for manuscript encoding. The results demonstrate the existence of a steep learning curve  for the TEI, where many practitioners are self-taught and where learning-by-doing dominates; there exists a long gap between the first encounter with the TEI and its actual use in projects. Survey results highlight the need for user-friendly, bespoke tools facilitating the processing, analysis, and publishing of TEI-encoded texts.  Feedback on the Guidelines themselves reveals aspects that do not fully meet the needs of those encoding manuscript material. To better address these needs, a strengthening of the Special Interest Groups is proposed.", "article_title": "The Present and Future of the TEI Community for Manuscript Encoding", "authors": [{"given": "Marjorie", "family": "Burghart", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Lyon, France", "normalized_name": "School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02d9dg697", "GRID": "grid.17673.34"}}]}, {"given": "Malte", "family": "Rehbein", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Würzburg University", "normalized_name": "University of Würzburg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fbnyb24", "GRID": "grid.8379.5"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
