{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper will review the structure and development philosophy of Heurist, a database abstraction which hides the complexity of richly structured databases from the end-user, allowing them to build complex databases without programmer assistance. It will address the opposition between serendipitous development by scholar-programmers and structured development by software engineers, using two mobile applications developed within Heurist as case studies. I argue that serendipitous development is important at both levels â€” in the development of databases as in the development of the software. The paper aims to stimulate debate on software development methodologies and the role of the scholar-programmer.", "article_title": "From database to mobile app: scholar-led development of the Heurist platform", "authors": [{"given": "Ian R.", "family": "Johnson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Sydney, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Sydney", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0384j8v12", "GRID": "grid.1013.3"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["knowledge representation", "databases & dbms", "information architecture", "software design and development", "mobile applications and mobile design", "interface and user experience design"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
