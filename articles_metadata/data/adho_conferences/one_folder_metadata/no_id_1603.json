The goal of these conversations were threefold: 1) to clearly articulate the challenges facing researchers integrating 3D tools and methods into their scholarship, 2) to outline key questions and new lines of inquiry for future investigation, and 3) to develop actionable recommendations to position 3D work as a valid-and viable-mode of knowledge production. This paper describes that process , the topics chosen for discussion, and the resultant list of action items for the 3D community.", "article_title": "Can VR Survive Peer Review?
