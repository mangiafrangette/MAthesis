This project responds to that problem by developing an approach for identifying the appearance of often unnamed individuals across a corpus by integrating semi-supervised machine-learning based phrase mining, network visualization, and an event model from human rights reporting known as “Who Did What to Whom.” This natural language processing method facilitates the retrieval of cross-document narratives of victims — and perpetrators — of population level events.", "article_title": "Digging into Human Rights Violations: phrase mining and trigram visualization", "authors": [{"given": "Ben", "family": "Miller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Georgia State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Georgia State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qt6ba18", "GRID": "grid.256304.6"}}]}, {"given": "Fuxin", "family": "Li", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "normalized_name": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01zkghx44", "GRID": "grid.213917.f"}}]}, {"given": "Ayush", "family": "Shrestha", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Georgia State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Georgia State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qt6ba18", "GRID": "grid.256304.6"}}]}, {"given": "Karthikeyan", "family": "Umapathy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of North Florida", "normalized_name": "University of North Florida", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01j903a45", "GRID": "grid.266865.9"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["linguistics", "information retrieval", "data mining/text mining", "natural language processing", "text analysis", "corpora and corpus activities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
