{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper describes VizOR, a new digital resource currently under development, that visualizes Mark Z. Danielewski’s 2006 novel Only Revolutions. VizOR is built on top of a MySQL database comprised of the complete text of Only Revolutions and is programmed in Python to produce a dynamic, database-driven visualization of the novel. In this paper, we discuss the methods and procedures we are currently developing to create this visualization and highlight the implications of these methods and procedures for theoretical concerns in both digital humanities and media studies. This project, we propose, is both a re-reading of and an exploration of the process of reading Danielewski’s novel: as such, it joins the novel in examining the interrelation of human and machine “reading” and “authorship,” pointing to a procedural understanding of reading and writing and suggesting that both activities occur across a wide variety of actors and platforms.", "article_title": "VizOR: Visualizing Only Revolutions, Visualizing Textual Analysis", "authors": [{"given": "Dana Ryan", "family": "Solomon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UC Santa Barbara, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of California, Santa Barbara", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02t274463", "GRID": "grid.133342.4"}}]}, {"given": "Lindsay", "family": "Thomas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UC Santa Barbara, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of California, Santa Barbara", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02t274463", "GRID": "grid.133342.4"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["creative and performing arts,including writing, cultural studies, visualisation, data mining/text mining", "literary studies", "information architecture", "text analysis", "software design and development", "content analysis", "knowledge representation", "databases & dbms", "programming", "management", "encoding — theory and practice", "machine translation", "metadata", "project design", "query languages", "organization", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
