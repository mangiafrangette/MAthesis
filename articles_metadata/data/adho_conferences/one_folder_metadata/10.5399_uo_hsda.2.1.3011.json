This diverse positioning in relation to the work of women writers has allowed feminist criticism to develop a path that has deconstructed the Italian literary canon and the promotion of critical stances that are no longer abstract or monologic, but rather situated in the point of view of the subject and its relational component. Works by Italian women writers present themselves as a body of texts of high material density that transfer questions of textual mobility both within digital and print culture onto the subject and its style of enunciation.", "article_title": "Umane lettere: dai corpi testuali agli stili dell’enunciazione", "authors": [{"given": "Laura", "family": "Fortini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Università Roma Tre", "normalized_name": "Roma Tre University", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05vf0dg29", "GRID": "grid.8509.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
