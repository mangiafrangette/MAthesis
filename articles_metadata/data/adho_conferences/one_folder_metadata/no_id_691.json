The book argues that Platonic writing, like Socratic speaking, is designed to turn us towards ideals of speaking and acting capable of transforming our lives and the community in which we live. In this short paper, I propose to offer a brief overview of the basic philosophical argument of the book in order then to turn in more detail to the logistics of how the enhanced digital book will be designed to further cultivate a community of readers capable of performing the politics of reading and writing for which the book itself argues. Conclusions will be drawn about the affordances and limitations of using digital media, particularly social media, to perform rigorous and public scholarly research in philosophy.", "article_title": "eBook as Ecosystem of Digital Scholarship", "authors": [{"given": "Christopher P.", "family": "Long", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Pennsylvania State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Pennsylvania State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04p491231", "GRID": "grid.29857.31"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["philosophy", "networks", "classical studies", "video", "audio", "   ", "social media", "publishing and delivery systems", "relationships", "internet/world wide web", "graphs", "multimedia", "interface and user experience design"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
