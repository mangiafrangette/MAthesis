However, such methods cannot be used for multilingual texts in which the author switches between languages within a sentence, as in the “Chymistry of Isaac Newton”, a collection of writings on alchemy by Newton. In these documents, Newton often switches between English, Latin, and French, even within sentences. For this reason, we have developed a new method for automatically identifying the language for single words rather than for complete texts.", "article_title": "Word-level Language Identification in “The Chymistry of Isaac Newton“", "authors": [{"given": "Levi", "family": "King", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}, {"given": "Sandra", "family": "Kübler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}, {"given": "Wallace", "family": "Hooper", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["corpora and corpus activities", "natural language processing", "text analysis", "software design and development"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
