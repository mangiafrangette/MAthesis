{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "In this work, we present an analysis of Les Confessions, the autobiography from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, one of the first book of this kind. Co-occurrences are considered as relations between characters appearing in theses memories under certain constraints. Then a network is generated, and social network analysis tools are applied. We present different methods to construct the network of co-occurrences, and describe features of this social network as degree and cluster distributions, small-world property and negative assortativity. We also observe a separation into two clusters due to the writing of the book in two times, with an important number of characters appearing in both volumes. Methods to determine a minimum number of co-occurrences to generate social networks close to the situation that occurred at the time (18th century) are also proposed and studied. Finally, we discuss the opportunity to consider this object as a realist social network of its era.", "article_title": "A social network analysis of Rousseau's autobiography \"Les Confessions\"", "authors": [{"given": "Yannick", "family": "Rochat", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "EPFL, Switzerland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Cyril", "family": "Bornet", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "OZWE, Lausanne, Switzerland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Frédéric", "family": "Kaplan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "EPFL, Switzerland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "networks", "french studies", "literary studies", "graphs", "relationships"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
