{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Though humanities graduates have long engaged in a wide range of stimulating careers, very little data has been collected on humanities scholars working outside the professoriate. Consequently, discussions about alternative academic careers—those within the orbit of universities and cultural heritage institutions, but off the tenure track—have been largely anecdotal. In order to ground the conversation, the Scholarly Communication Institute (SCI) initiated a study in 2012 to investigate perceptions about career preparation provided by graduate programs. The main goal of the study, which focused primarily on the context of North American higher education, was to establish a body of data that can serve as a foundation on which to base recommendations for new and revised methodological training. The results of the study reveal clear patterns that highlight the current strengths of graduate education relative to non-professorial employment, as well as significant opportunities for improvement.", "article_title": "From Anecdote to Data: Humanities Scholars Beyond the Tenure Track", "authors": [{"given": "Katina Lynn", "family": "Rogers", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Scholarly Communication Institute, University of Virginia, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["teaching and pedagogy", "digital humanities — pedagogy and curriculum", "project design", "management", "organization"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
