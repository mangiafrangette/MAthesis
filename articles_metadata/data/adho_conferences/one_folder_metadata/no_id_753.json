{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper will advocate that digital scholarly editions should follow five guiding principles, briefly: 1. The text of both the document and of the work should be encoded; 2. All editorial acts should be attributed; 3. All materials should, by default, be available by a Creative Commons share-alike license; 4. All materials should be available independent of any one interface; 5. All materials should be held in a sustainable long-term storage system, such as an institutional repository. No editions made so far appear to follow all five principles; and many satisfy not even one of these principles. The reasons for the distance between existing digital editions and these principles may provoke useful debate.", "article_title": "Five desiderata for scholarly editions in digital form", "authors": [{"given": "Peter", "family": "Robinson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["sustainability and preservation", "cultural infrastructure", "copyright", "repositories", "licensing, and Open Access", "archives", "scholarly editing", "corpora and corpus activities, encoding - theory and practice"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
