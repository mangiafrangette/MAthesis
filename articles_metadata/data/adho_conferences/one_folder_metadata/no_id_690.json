{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The study of narrative is an essential part of understanding not only literature, but its appeal. So far, machine analysis of plot has been based on either mark-up based systems or formal models of plot, both of which rely extensively on models or experience found outside the corpus under review. This paper presents a new approach that learns the structure and details of plot directly from the corpus itself in an unsupervised fashion. This technique, adapted from stylometry, is demonstrated with a corpus of romance novels, showing that while the genre is somewhat formulaic, several discrete narrative strategies emerge as important - showing the genre is, in fact, composed of several formulas. This novel approach to observing, rather than preconceiving, plot structure opens a new horizon for stylometric tools.", "article_title": "Unsupervised Learning of Plot Structure: A Study in Category Romance", "authors": [{"given": "Jack", "family": "Elliott", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Newcastle, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["linguistics", "authorship attribution / authority", "data mining/ text mining", "cultural studies", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling", "programming", "english studies", "natural language processing", "literary studies", "text analysis"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
