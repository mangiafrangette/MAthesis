This paratextual space—instantiated in what are traditionally considered secondary or ancillary texts such as footnotes, commentary, translation, and so forth—produces and ramifies the \"main\" text, the object that is thus presented to our interest as primarily significant. It is precisely through the paratexts that the concept of a \"main\" text emerges at all: in a given historical moment, depending on social, cultural, political, and other factors, a certain text emerges, and slowly starts to circulate and acquire status through the effects of its paratexts: comments, editions, translations, dedications, and so forth.In a digital environment, the idea of the paratext may allow us to recognize the significance and the mode of operation of certain crucial textual formations that might otherwise seem inconsequential. An example of such a formation is the information we might call \"microtexts\": that is, external, contingently visible “microcontents” (Nielsen 2000) that describe, illustrate or complete information within a web page or resource. These include also embedded alternate texts that usually appear when you move the mouse over an image, link or any other semiotic device (Zinna 2005). Another example is what we might call \"metatexts\", a category embracing both formal metadata and also looser kinds of descriptive, normative or regulative information, usually not directly visible to the user, that is added in order to allow search engines and other processing to produce coherent and useful results.These terms arise from an external classification (one which could be extended) emphasizing the different ways these paratexts function as part of a publication architecture. But digital paratexts can be also organized, according to their cognitive and semiotic functions, into at least three flexible (and mutually permeable) categories: 1. descriptive (syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes): those paratexts which contain information about a text, including various kinds of metadata;2. normative: those which constrain the behavior of the text (for instance, schemas)3. pragmatic: those which mediate or represent the text as a discursive object, and which produce its digital phenomenology.These formations, unlike traditional paratexts, are not always literally visible as part of the legible textual surface: their \"strategy\" and \"pragmatics\" operate through the representational and performative mechanisms of the digital interface. In print, the paratext has (despite its marginality) a certain visible presence on the page: its meaning may be wholly in relation to the text it supports, but it is not different in kind from that text (Tomasi 2005). The digital paratexts we are describing, however, occupy a different stratum and have a different kind of visibility and functional effect. Their presence may be felt primarily in what the text does or in how we discover it, rather than in the words we see when we read it. Their separateness is demarcated through markup, which not only creates a boundary between text and paratext but also makes the paratext into a space of function and behavior: of meaning instantiated through action rather than simply through textual signification. In this respect, these categories of paratext (and in particular the last, which is the realm of markup proper) are analogous to the punctuation, formatting, and presentational conventions through which a printed text is realized for a reader, or through which an oral text is concretized in print. As Genette observes, any transcription, including the written transcription of an oral speech, is a form of paratext, and we can usefully extend this idea to digital forms by observing that any encoding—in effect, any transmediation—constitutes a form of paratext as well.Each of the three categories above illustrates a distinctive dimension of the digital paratext, and raises a set of questions and issues that can help us reach a clearer understanding of the role of markup and the nature of digital texts. If we consider markup in Genette’s terms as a “privileged space” of “action” and “pragmatics”, what effect does this have on our understanding of text encoding as a transcriptional activity? To what extent do our disciplinary expectations about documentary evidence run counter to the logic implied by these terms? The boundary between transcription and authoring (and our sense of where the distinction lies) may turn out to be harder to pin down than has previously been suggested.Similarly, to what extent does metadata operate as an active, rather than a passive component of the textual ecology? If we understand metadata creation as part of the authoring of the digital document, does this change our sense of who should be creating it and what its sources should be?Finally, if schemas and stylesheets can also be understood as paratexts (for instance, as suggested in Pierazzo 2006), then we need to rethink our conception of textual meaning and rhetoric to include not only the forms a text actually takes, but also those which its constraints permit it to take: in other words, the potential as well as actual forms through which we apprehend the text.", "article_title": "Markup and the Digital Paratext", "authors": [{"given": "Julia ", "family": "Flanders", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Brown University", "normalized_name": "Brown University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gq02987", "GRID": "grid.40263.33"}}]}, {"given": "Domenico ", "family": "Fiormonte", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Rome", "normalized_name": "University of Rome Tor Vergata", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02p77k626", "GRID": "grid.6530.0"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2007", "keywords": ["theory", "metadata", "encoding"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
