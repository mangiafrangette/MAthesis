The authors introduce the University of Victoria's grant service \"menu\" for digital preservation and hosting services, and outline some of the most promising models for balancing creativity with sustainability in DH project design. We will suggest roles for libraries, researchers, administrators, and funders in helping to create technical and social conditions that nurture sustainable research projects in the digital humanities and beyond. Abstract Knowledge building is an iterative process that refines and extends previous research. Through citation, we acknowledge our debt to scholars and theorists whose work enables our own.
