Because of the relaxed definition of its data model - essentially a set of annotated ranges over a text, in no particular relation to one another except as processing may assume or infer -- LMNL offers a great deal of freedom in modeling and description. Nevertheless, because it is defined formally and generically, it is possible to build generic processing pipelines for LMNL, to support operations such as filtering, indexing, renaming and transformation. XML can be extracted from LMNL; diagrams can be drawn representing marked up features.
