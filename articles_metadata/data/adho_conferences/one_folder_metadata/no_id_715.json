{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Although scholars have long recognized the need to employ digital analysis of human movement, especially in dance, the technology for such analyses has not been available. Further, Wang (2003) noted that the majority of research conducted into movement patterns has been for surveillance, while ‘the breadth of uses for motion analysis beyond surveillance includes sports and ballet’. The present work, funded by an NEH Digital Start-up Grant and an ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship, addresses this lack by developing methodologies for computer identification of dance movements in 3-D, through initial work towards the ability to have computer analysis and tagging of 2-D dance film. In addition we have developed an ontology and identified movement patterns relative to natural language ‘terms’ (conceptual metaphor). Finally, we have conducted a “deep reading” of the dance texts to classify movement into metaphoric concepts.", "article_title": "Computer Identification of Movement in 2D and 3D Data", "authors": [{"given": "Susan L.", "family": "Wiesner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia; Society of Dance History Scholars", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": "Bradford C.", "family": "Bennett", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": "Rommie L.", "family": "Stalnaker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Independent Scholar/Artist; San Diego United", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Travis", "family": "Simpson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "interdisciplinary collaboration", "video", "audio", "multimedia", "including writing", "creative and performing arts"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
