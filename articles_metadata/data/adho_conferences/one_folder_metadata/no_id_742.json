{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper provides a description and analysis of the trajectory of Project Bamboo, a major humanities cyberinfrastructure initiative in the United States. While previous work has addressed the opportunities, consequences and form of humanities cyberinfrastructure, very little has been written about Project Bamboo, and how it does and does not reflect visions put forth for humanities cyberinfrastructure. In addition, there has been little discussion of the precipitous drop in community enthusiasm and even awareness of Bamboo, despite its considerable amount of funding. This paper will elucidate the evolution of Project Bambooâ€™s goals and scope from its inception to the present, the factors that have contributed to its increasingly negative public perception (including an assessment of which form inherent problems for cyberinfrastructure initiatives vs. avoidable tactical missteps), and how Bamboo is working to overcome those issues as it moves forward.", "article_title": "What ever happened to Project Bamboo?", "authors": [{"given": "Quinn", "family": "Dombrowski", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, Berkeley, United States of America", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "cultural infrastructure", "project design", "digital humanities - institutional support", "management", "organization", "history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
