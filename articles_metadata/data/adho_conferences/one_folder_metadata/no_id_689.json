{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This short paper seeks to introduce the Digital Humanities community to three ongoing, interrelated projects: the Media History Digital Library (an open access digital resource, www.mediahistoryproject.org), Lantern (a search tool, http://lantern-demo.commarts.wisc.edu/) and Coding Media History (a text mining research project). Together, these three projects aim to use digital technology to transform the field of Film and Media Studies, a discipline that has lagged English and History in the creation of high impact DH work. I would also like to suggest that the three interrelated projects demonstrate a productive model for scaffolding work in the Digital Humanities. The three sides of my work—enabling access, building tools, and text analysis—support and enhance one another.", "article_title": "Coding Media History: A Digital Suite for Opening Access, Building Tools, and Analyzing Texts", "authors": [{"given": "Eric Rutledge", "family": "Hoyt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "normalized_name": "University of Wisconsin–Madison", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01y2jtd41", "GRID": "grid.14003.36"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "sustainability and preservation", "audio", "discovery", "linking and annotation", "historical studies", "repositories", "standards and interoperability", "archives", "xml", "media studies", "text analysis", "software design and development", "resource creation", "concording and indexing", "interface and user experience design", "law", "content analysis", "interdisciplinary collaboration", "databases & dbms", "licensing", "digitisation", "multimedia", "encoding — theory and practice", "copyright", "video", "metadata", "digitisation — theory and practice", "film and cinema studies", "Open Access"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
