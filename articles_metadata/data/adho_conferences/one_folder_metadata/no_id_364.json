{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "A signifi cant number of digital editions have been published in recent years, and many of these serve as exemplars for those of us working within the digital editing community. A glance at Electronic Text Editing, for example, published in 2006, indicates that such projects address a wide berth of editorial problems, ranging from transcriptional practices to document management to authenticity. And they offer a wealth of information to editors working on various types of digital editions. In this paper, I consider an editorial problem that has yet to be resolved. My discussion centers on the diffi culties that arise in editing a single, albeit somewhat unusual, Icelandic saga: Hafgeirs saga Flateyings. This saga is preserved in an unsigned, eighteenth-century manuscript, Additamenta 6, folio (Add. 6, fol.). Today housed in the collection of the Arni Magnusson Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjavík, Iceland, the manuscript was originally held as part of the Arnamagnæan Collection in Copenhagen, Denmark. According to the fl yleaf: “Saga af Hafgeyre fl ateying udskreven af en Membran der kommen er fra Island 1774 in 4to exarata Seculo xij” (Hafgeirs saga Flayetings was copied from a twelfth-century manuscript written in quarto, which came [to Copenhagen] from Iceland in 1774). While such a manuscript might appear unremarkable, as a number of paper manuscripts were copied during the late eighteenth century in Copenhagen, then the capital of Iceland and the seat of Icelandic manuscript transmission during this period, only twelve Old Norse/Old Icelandic manuscripts of those catalogued in the Copenhagen collections are dated to the twelfth century, while a mere eighteen are dated to 1200 (Kalund 512). The dating on the fl yleaf is therefore unusual, and as it turns out, suspect as well, since no catalog entry exists to record the existence of the alleged source manuscript. Moreover, according to Jorgensen, the motif sequences found in Hafgeirs saga bear a striking resemblance to those found in the well-known mythical-heroic saga Hálfdanars saga Brönufóstra (157). And in a fascinating argument based primarily on this fact, Jorgensen argues that Add. 6, fol. is a forgery, claiming that Þorlákur Magnússon Ísfi ord, an Icelandic student studying and working in Copenhagen during the 1780s, composed and sold Hafgeirs saga as a copy of an authentic medieval Icelandic saga (163). In spite of its questionable origin, Hafgeirs saga stands as a remnant of Iceland’s literary, linguistic, and textual history, and Add. 6, fol. can therefore be viewed as an important cultural artefact. As the editor of the Hafgeirs saga manuscript, my aim is to provide a ‘reliable’ (see “Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions” Section 1.1) electronic edition of the text and the manuscript. But the question, at least until recently, was how? What is the best way to represent such a text? Encoding the work according to a markup standard such as the TEI Guidelines is surely a starting point, but doing so doesn’t solve one of the primary concerns: How to represent the manuscript reliably (which presents a complex editorial problem of its own), while at the same time illuminating the textual and linguistic ‘artefacts’ that may offer readers insight into the saga’s origin? At the 2007 Digital Humanities Summer Institute, Matthew Driscoll gave a talk entitled “Everything But the Smell: Toward a More Artefactual Digital Philology.” The talk provided a brief history of the shift toward ‘new’ philology, and, importantly, underscored the signifi cance of the material or ‘artefactual’ aspect of new philology, which views manuscripts as physical objects and thus as cultural artefacts which offer insight into the “process to which they are witness” (“Everything But the Smell: Toward a More Artefactual Digital Philology”). The TEI, Driscoll pointed out, offers support for artefactual philology, and the descriptive framework of the P5 Guidelines, which defi nes Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the underlying encoding language, is ideal for this kind of work. Moreover, as Driscoll suggests, there is “no limit to the information one can add to a text - apart, that is, from the limits of our own imagination” (“Electronic Textual Editing: Levels of Transcription”). To be sure, this paper does not lapse into what McCarty refers to as the ‘complete encoding fallacy’ or the ‘mimetic fallacy’ (see Dahlström 24), but it does agree with Driscoll in arguing that P5-conformant editions, which can offer a signifi cant layering of data and metadata, have the potential to move the reader beyond the aesthetics of sensory experience. By defi nition, artefactual philology portends a kind of ‘evidentiary’ approach, one that can frame textual features, including linguistic and non-linguistic features (such as lacunae) for example, as kinds of evidence. Evidence of what? That is in the hands of the editors and the readers, but conceivably: linguistic development, the transmission process, literary merit, and so on. And when an evidentiary approach to philology is defi ned within a ‘generative’ approach to a scholarly edition (see Vanhoutte’s “Generating” 164), a new direction in electronic editing becomes possible. This paper explores this new direction. It shows how the Hafgeirs saga edition employs such a framework to address the problem of describing linguistic and non-linguistic artefacts, which are precisely the kinds of evidence that can bear witness to the composition date and transmission process. And it demonstrates how the display decisions result in an interactive and dynamic experience for the edition’s readers. For example, in addition to elements defi ned within existing modules of the TEI, the edition’s schema defi nes four new elements1. Drawn from the perspectives of historical and socio- linguistics, these elements are intended to aid readers in evaluating the saga’s composition date. Given the ‘logic of abundance’ (see Flanders 135), encoding the metadata described in the new elements beside the descriptive data described by pre-defi ned elements (such as <del> for example) can be accomplished without sacrifi cing the role of the text as a literary and cultural artefact. Because the transformation of the source XML has been designed to display interactively the various encodings of the text2, readers can view or suppress the various descriptions and generate their own novel versions of the text. Readers can display archaisms, for instance, and assess whether they are “affectation[s] of spurious age” (Einar 39) or features consistent with the textual transmission process, and they can view borrowings, for instance, and assess whether they preclude a medieval origin or are to be expected in a text ostensibly copied by a scribe living in Copenhagen during the eighteenth century. Or they can suppress these features and view the normalized transcription, the semi-diplomatic transcription, emendations, editorial comments, or any combination of these. Ultimately, this paper synthesizes aspects of text editing, philology, and linguistics to explore a new direction in digital editing. In doing so, it frames P5 XML as a kind of luminol that, when transformed, can be used to illuminate new types of evidence: linguistic and philological data. And the goal is identical to that of a crime-scene investigator’s: Not necessarily to solve the case, but to preserve and to present the evidence.", "article_title": "The TEI as Luminol: Forensic Philology in a Digital Age", "authors": [{"given": "Stephanie ", "family": "Schlitz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bloomsburg University, USA", "normalized_name": "Bloomsburg University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/007dga614", "GRID": "grid.253165.6"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
