{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The paper gives, fi rstly, a brief overview over the history of Middle High German (MHG) lexicography leading to the new MHG dictionary. Secondly, it describes the digitisation of the old MHG dictionaries which form a subnet in a wider net of German dictionaries. Thirdly, this network, together with specifi c tools and digital texts, is seen as an essential source for compiling the new MHG dictionary, of which, fourthly, the essential features, esp. its online version, are mentioned briefl y, but will be demonstrated in detail in the full paper. 1. Looking back at the beginnings of Humanities Computing in the sixties, one of the major subjects was the support the computer would give to lexicographers. Many e-texts have been created then for mere lexicographical purposes (Wisbey 1988). The production of concordances and indices was at its heights between 1970 and 1980 (cf. Gärtner 1980). However, the road to real dictionary making came only gradually in sight when lemmatization was required and semantics began to dominate the discussion of computer application in lexicography. The work on the dictionaries to the medieval Germanic languages benefi ted a great deal from this development. This has certainly been the case regarding MHG, the period of German from ca. 1050 to ca. 1350 resp. – in the earlier periodisations – to 1500. During the 20th century, the situation of MHG lexicography had become more and more deplorable. Since Lexer’s dictionary appeared in 1878, all plans for a new dictionary had been unsuccessful. Therefore, many editors of MHG texts published after 1878 provided glossaries as a means of presenting such material that was not included in the earlier dictionaries edited by Benecke/Müller/Zarncke (BMZ) and Lexer with its Nachträge. It was not until 1985 that a group of researchers at the University of Trier started compiling the Findebuch which was published in 1992. The Findebuch was a compilation of glossaries to editions in order to make up for the lack of a new MHG dictionary. Also in the late eighties, on the basis of the work on the Findebuch, planning began to work out a new MHG dictionary (cf. Gärtner/Grubmüller 2000). This time the plans were successful, and work on the new dictionary started in 1994. The scientifi c use of the computer had meanwhile become a conditio sine qua non, also for the new MHG dictionary (cf. Gärtner/Plate/Recker 1999). 2. The work on a new dictionary relies to a great deal on its predecessors. As the Findebuch had been compiled with extensive use of the computer and existed in machine readable form, the need for digitizing the old MHG dictionaries was strongly felt from the beginning of the new dictionary’s planning. The old dictionaries (BMZ, Lexer with Nachträge) and the Findebuch are closely interconnected and can only be used simultaneously. They were ideal candidates for the composition of an electronic dictionary compound. Therefore, as a supporting research project to the new dictionary, the old ones were digitized and interlinked thus forming a digital network (MWV). The work on this project has been described to the LLC readers in detail (Fournier 2001; see also Burch/ Fournier 2001). Moreover, this network formed the starting point for a wider net that interlinks many more dictionaries to the German language and its dialects (cf. Woerterbuchnetz). The most prominent among them is the 33vols. Deutsches Wörterbuch (DWB) by the brothers Grimm. 3. The work on the new MHG dictionary (MWB) was considerably supported by two more projects. First and most essential for lexicographers working in different places was the implementation of a web based workbench for the composition of dictionaries. The development of a toolkit for a collaborative editing and publishing of the MWB has also been described to LLC readers in detail (Queens/Recker 2005). The second project supporting the work on the new dictionary was the extension of the digital text archive. At the beginning of the work on the MWB, the lexicographical workbench had to rely only on a small corpus of digital texts. This number was effectively increased by a collaborative project with the Electronic Text Center of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville (cf. Recker 2002 and MHDTA/MHGTA 2004). By now nearly all the texts of the Findebuch corpus have been digitized and added to the corpus of the new dictionary. 4. In 2006 the fi rst instalment of the new MWB was published together with a CD-ROM containing a PDF of the printed form. The online version was to follow in 2007. All digital resources created for the new dictionary are fi rstly to the advantage of the lexicographer, and secondly and still more important to the advantage of the user as well. The lexicographer’s workbench provides an alphabetical list of headwords (Lemmaliste), it offers an easy and quick access to the old dictionaries (BMZ, Lexer, Findebuch), to the lemmatized archive of instances (Belegearchiv) in form of a KWIC-concordance, and fi nally to the whole corpus of etexts which can be searched for more evidences. Not only the lexicographer, but also the user of the online version has access to all information on the usage of a MHG word, as I will demonstrate in detail. As the new MWB is a long term project, the online version not only offers the already published instalments, but also the complete material the forthcoming fascicles are based upon. Furthermore, for the entries still to be worked out the old dictionaries are always present for consultation together with the new material of the archive and the corpus of etexts. Thus, linking old and new lexicographical resources proves immensely valuable not only for the workbench of the lexicographer, but also for the user of his work.", "article_title": "The New Middle High German Dictionary and its Predecessors as an Interlinked Compound of Lexicographical Resources", "authors": [{"given": "Kurt ", "family": "Gärtner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universität Trier , Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Trier", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02778hg05", "GRID": "grid.12391.38"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
