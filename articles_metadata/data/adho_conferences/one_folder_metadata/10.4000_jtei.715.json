The Register attempts to address this gap in Slovenian manuscript studies by describing these unknown and forgotten early modern manuscripts with facsimiles, an index of basic manuscript citations, and a bibliography containing publications where these manuscripts are mentioned. It is encoded in TEI P5 using the manuscript description module and available via a web interface. The paper discusses the specifics of early modern manuscripts, explains the structure and encoding of the Register (especially encoding of temporal and geographic data), and presents the portal built using the Fedora Commons repository software that allows the user to browse and search manuscripts and export data in TEI format, and that enables metadata harvesting.", "article_title": "A Register of Early Modern Slovenian Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": "Matija", "family": "Ogrin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Slovenian Academy of Sciences, Ljubljana, Slovenia", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Jan Jona", "family": "Javoršek", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Jožef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia", "normalized_name": "Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School", "country": "Slovenia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hdkb925", "GRID": "grid.445211.7"}}]}, {"given": "Tomaž", "family": "Erjavec", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Jožef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia", "normalized_name": "Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School", "country": "Slovenia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hdkb925", "GRID": "grid.445211.7"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
