The project has two main objectives: (a) assigning basic structures to previously digitised texts, so-called divisions in TEI nomenclature, thus creating a set of new digital objects, and (b) the subsequent categorisation of these texts with the purpose of being able to create thematically organised sub-corpora. An additional objective was to have metadata stored as TEI headers.", "article_title": "Towards Finer Granularity in Metadata", "authors": [{"given": "Gerhard", "family": "Budin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Vienna", "normalized_name": "University of Vienna", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03prydq77", "GRID": "grid.10420.37"}}, {"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}]}, {"given": "Heinrich", "family": "Kabas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}]}, {"given": "Karlheinz", "family": "Mörth", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Vienna", "normalized_name": "University of Vienna", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03prydq77", "GRID": "grid.10420.37"}}, {"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
