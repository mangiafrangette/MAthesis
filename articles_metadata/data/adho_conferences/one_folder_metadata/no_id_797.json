At An Foras Feasa we repeatedly faced the same meta-Use Cases; researchers wished to create digital versions of their source-system (which might either be a single source represented by components within the system e.g. a manuscript of page-components, or multiple sources connected together, e.g. an archive of diverse materials1) that were reflective of their own, personal theoretical opinions, provided tools for investigation of those sources, and permitted re-use of many types such as teaching and learning. It was desirable that other researchers would be able to reinterpret and repurpose hosted digital source-systems to create a digital version consistent with their own theoretical position. This implied that any solution would need to be able to handle multiple, configurable, versions of a digital source-systems, and multiple metadata descriptions of any single component within the source-system.", "article_title": "An Environment to Support User-Structured Digital Humanities Sources", "authors": [{"given": "Aja", "family": "Teehan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "An Foras Feasa, Ireland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "John", "family": "Keating", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "An Foras Feasa, Ireland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["user studies/user needs", "information architecture", "digitisation â€” theory and practice", "literary studies", "music"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
