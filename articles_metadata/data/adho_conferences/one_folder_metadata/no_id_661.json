What is the state of the art in the field of digital editions? To address these questions, we have collated relevant evidence in a detailed catalogue of one-hundred digital editions, which will be further developed into a large, scholarly online resource for the Digital Humanities and Digital Classicist communities. The catalogue records project features, scope, philological as well as technological aspects and, once all the data we have collected has been analysed, it will help establish the state of the art and draw a 'digital edition best practice' profile. Furthermore, the creators of each project have been contacted to access back-end information, such as project goals, budgets, achievements, user enquiries and user statistics, all of which will help to clearly define both the production needs and end-user requirements for digital editions.", "article_title": "A catalogue of digital editions", "authors": [{"given": "Greta", "family": "Franzini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Digital Humanities, UCL, GB", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "sustainability and preservation", "resource creation and discovery", "user studies/user needs", "repositories", "archives", "scholarly editing", "digitisation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
