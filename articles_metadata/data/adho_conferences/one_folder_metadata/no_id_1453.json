{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Lexos is a browser-based suite of tools that helps lower barriers of entry to computational text analysis for humanities scholars and students. Situated within a clean and simple interface, Lexos consolidates the common pre-processing operations needed for subsequent analysis, either with Lexos or with external tools. It is especially useful for scholars who wish to engage in research involving computational text analysis and/or wish to teach their students how to do so but lack the time for a manual preparation of texts, the skill sets needed to prepare their texts analysis, or the intellectual contexts for situating computational methods within their work. Lexos is also targeted at researchers studying early texts and texts in non-Western languages, which may involve specialized processing rules. It is thus designed to facilitate advanced research in these fields even for users more familiar with computational techniques.", "article_title": "Lexos: An Integrated Lexomics Workflow", "authors": [{"given": "Scott", "family": "Kleinman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "California State University", "normalized_name": "California State University, Chico", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/027bzz146", "GRID": "grid.253555.1"}}]}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Leblanc", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Wheaton College", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
