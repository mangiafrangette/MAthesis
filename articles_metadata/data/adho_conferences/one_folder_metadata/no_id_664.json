{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The aim of the proposal is to introduce a new method of authorship attribution that would be suitable in open-set attribution. The technique technique presented in this proposal is based on Delta and extended with the general concept of bootstrap. The method relies on the authorâ€™s empirical observation that the distance between samples similar to each other is quite stable despite different features tested, while the distance between heterogeneous samples usually displays some unsteadiness. The core of the procedure is to perform a series of attribution tests in 1,000 iterations, where the number of features to be analyzed is chosen randomly; in each iteration, the nearest neighbor classification is performed. The presented procedure displays an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art methods used in stylometry, but it is far more sensitive to fake candidates.", "article_title": "Bootstrapping Delta: a safety net in open-set authorship attribution", "authors": [{"given": "Maciej", "family": "Eder", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Pedagogical University, Krakow, Poland", "normalized_name": "Pedagogical University", "country": "Mozambique", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0331kj160", "GRID": "grid.442441.3"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["stylistics and stylometry", "literary studies", "authorship attribution / authority"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
