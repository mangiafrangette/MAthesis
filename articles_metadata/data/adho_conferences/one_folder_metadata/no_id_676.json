{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Algorithmic text generators, Oulipo forms, and collaborative art practice has created “authorless” texts that deliberately reject the unity and “sensefulness” of single-author works. I explore the opposite question: Is it possible to create an authorless text that looks and acts exactly like a conventional, authored work? I present Exquisite Haiku, a real-time web application that makes it possible for groups to work together to compose short poems. Drawing inspiration from the Exquisite Corpse, a classic Surrealist parlor game, the software pushes the collaborative process down to the level of individual word selections. I argue that this creates “unattributable” texts that lack authors and yet cannot be distinguished from “normal” texts. Far from being without origin, though, the game that produces them can be understood as a real-world enactment, at the level of artistic praxis, of 20th century critical frameworks that formulate meaning as something produced by readers and their communities.", "article_title": "Exquisite Haiku: Experiments with Real-Time, Collaborative Poetry Composition", "authors": [{"given": "David William", "family": "McClure", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Scholars' Lab, University of Virginia Library, United States of America", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["linguistics", "crowdsourcing", "text generation", "literary studies", "including writing", "creative and performing arts"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
