{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper introduces incidental crowdsourcing (IC): an approach to user-provided item description that adopts crowdsourcing as a way to think about augmentative features of system design. IC is intended to frame discussion around peripheral and non-critical system design choices. One place of value for IC is in generating augmented metadata about digital resources. There are two parts to the proposed paper. First, a provisional definition is offered. Examples that fit the definition are considered and used to refine the definition. This allows us to explore the robustness and feasibility of IC, looking at its uses and implications in representing digital objects in virtual spaces. In the second part, this paper shares an example study comparing the participation habits of users in two system features - one which is representative of IC properties and one which is not. This study find difference in user engagement between the two systems.", "article_title": "Incidental Crowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing in the Periphery", "authors": [{"given": "Peter", "family": "Organisciak", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047426m28", "GRID": "grid.35403.31"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "crowdsourcing", "internet / world wide web", "metadata"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
