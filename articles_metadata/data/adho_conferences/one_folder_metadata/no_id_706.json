HuNI is using Linked Data to combine a range of different Australian datasets and deploying a suite of software tools to enable researchers to work with the data in various ways. The HuNI project began in May 2012 and is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2013. It is being developed through a partnership between thirteen public institutions, led by Deakin University in Melbourne. At the Digital Humanities 2012 conference we presented a short paper on the overall design and proposed architecture for HuNI. We now propose a long paper reporting on HuNI’s progress in its first twelve months and demonstrating the initial version of the Virtual Laboratory.", "article_title": "A national virtual laboratory for the humanities in Australia: the HuNI (Humanities Networked Infrastructure) project", "authors": [{"given": "Toby Nicolas", "family": "Burrows", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Western Australia, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Western Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047272k79", "GRID": "grid.1012.2"}}]}, {"given": "Deb", "family": "Verhoeven", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Deakin University, Australia", "normalized_name": "Deakin University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02czsnj07", "GRID": "grid.1021.2"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "cultural infrastructure", "databases & dbms", "resource creation, and discovery", "semantic web", "project design", "metadata", "information architecture", "digitisation", "management", "GLAM: galleries, libraries, archives, museums", "organization"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
