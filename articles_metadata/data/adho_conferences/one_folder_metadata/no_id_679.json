It argues that the emergence of DH in its newly prominent forms during the past decade is closely connected to this larger shift in the collective imagination of the network. This context helps us understand the public role that DH might play in exploring multiple connections between digital and physical materialities out in the world. After summarizing he eversion and connected developments in DH, in conclusion Iâ€™ll suggest that games offer ways to think about the active role of DH in the ongoing eversion of the network, and about the engagement of humanities research with developments in the wider world.", "article_title": "The Network is Everting: the Death of Cyberspace and the Emergence of the Digital Humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Steven Edward", "family": "Jones", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Loyola University Chicago, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Loyola University Chicago", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04b6x2g63", "GRID": "grid.164971.c"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["cultural studies", "cultural infrastructure", "internet / world wide web", "games and meaningful play", "literary studies", "virtual and augmented reality", "digital humanities - nature and significance", "history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
