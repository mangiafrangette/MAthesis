{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "This paper presents substantive, cross-institutional research conducted on the relevance of desktop fabrication to digital humanities research. The researchers argue that *matter is a new medium for digital humanities,* and—as such—the field’s practitioners need to develop the workflows, best practices, and infrastructure necessary to meaningfully engage digital/material convergence, especially as it concerns the creation, preservation, exhibition, and delivery of cultural heritage materials in 3D. Aside from sharing example workflows, best practices, and infrastructure strategies, the paper identifies several key growth areas for desktop fabrication in digital humanities contexts. Ultimately, it demonstrates how *digital humanities is “made to make,” or already well-positioned to contribute significantly to desktop fabrication research.* Contributing Labs: The research has been conducted at the Scholars’ Lab (University of Virginia), the Humanistic Fabrication Lab (Western University), and the Maker Lab in the Humanities (University of Victoria).
