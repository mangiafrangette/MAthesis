The paper focuses on the annotation of speakers (different countries and institutional representatives) and their discourse in a selection of institutional documents (minutes, notes, studies, memoranda) (encoding phase) and the identification of linguistic patterns on armament issues in their discourse, as well as the interpretation of results (decoding phase).", "article_title": "Materiality of TEI Encoding and Decoding: An Analysis of the Western European Union Archives on Armament Policy", "authors": [{"given": "Florentina", "family": "Armaselu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Luxembourg", "normalized_name": "University of Luxembourg", "country": "Luxembourg", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/036x5ad56", "GRID": "grid.16008.3f"}}]}, {"given": "Verónica", "family": "Martins", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l’Europe", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Catherine Emma", "family": "Jones", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Luxembourg", "normalized_name": "University of Luxembourg", "country": "Luxembourg", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/036x5ad56", "GRID": "grid.16008.3f"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 9", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
