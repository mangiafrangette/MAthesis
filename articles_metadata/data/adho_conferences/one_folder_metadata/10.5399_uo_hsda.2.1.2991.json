This paper presents and discusses the problems encountered in producing a digital edition of the Zibaldone Laurenziano, Giovanni Boccaccio’s handwritten manuscript conserved in the Laurenziana Library in Florence (Pluteo XXIX, 8). The Medieval text in general, and even more with the case of a zibaldone-type text, has intrinsic characteristics that clash with the immobility and definitive nature typical of the print text. The digital edition has been defined by Lebrave as the “critical edition of the 21st century.” It can be based on hypertextuality and hypermediality, using the internet as a resource, and is perfectly able to render textual movement, restoring the text to its specific mobility.", "article_title": "Filologia digitale (a partire dal lavoro per l’edizione informatica dello Zibaldone Laurenziano di Boccaccio)", "authors": [{"given": "Raul", "family": "Mordenti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
