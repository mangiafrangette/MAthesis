This DH2013 presentation on the Slave Biographies project will not only give a comprehensive overview of the project but will outline the challenges of dealing with large historical datasets. However, what is most exciting about the project is that by bringing together large sets of data, we cannot only do large calculations and visualizations about the historical practices of slavery, but we can drill down to find rich representations of individuals and families, giving life to the individual biographies of slaves and their relations and contexts.", "article_title": "Slave Biographies: Atlantic Database Network", "authors": [{"given": "Dean", "family": "Rehberger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Michigan State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Michigan State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05hs6h993", "GRID": "grid.17088.36"}}]}, {"given": "Walter", "family": "Hawthorne", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Michigan State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Michigan State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05hs6h993", "GRID": "grid.17088.36"}}]}, {"given": "Gwendolyn", "family": "Midlo Hall", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Michigan State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Michigan State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05hs6h993", "GRID": "grid.17088.36"}}]}, {"given": "Paul", "family": "LaChance", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Ottawa, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Ottawa", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03c4mmv16", "GRID": "grid.28046.38"}}]}, {"given": "Catherine", "family": "Foley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Michigan State University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Michigan State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05hs6h993", "GRID": "grid.17088.36"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["data mining/ text mining", "sustainability and preservation", "historical studies", "repositories", "databases & dbms", "anthropology", "metadata", "archives", "maps and mapping", "visualisation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
