{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "As the amount of scholarly material published in digital form increases, there is growing pressure on content producers to identify the needs of expert readers and to create online tools that satisfy their requirements. Based on the results of a study conducted by the Public Knowledge Project and introduced at Digital Humanities 2006 (Siemens, Willinsky and Blake), continued and augmented since, this paper discusses the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate students to using a set of online reading tools. Expert readers were asked about the value of using online tools that allowed them to check, readily, related studies that were not cited in the article; to examine work that has followed on the study reported in the article; to consider additional work that has been done by the same author; and to consult additional sources on the topic outside of the academic literature. In the course of this study, these domain-expert readers made it clear that reading tools could make a defi nite, if limited, contribution to their critical engagement with journal articles (especially if certain improvements were made). Their reactions also point to an existing set of sophisticated reading strategies common to most expert readers. Our fi ndings indicate that online tools are of most value to expert readers when they complement and augment readers’ existing strategies. We have organized the results of the study around a number of themes that emerged during our interviews with domain expert readers as these themes speak to both readers’ existing reading processes and the potential value of the online reading tools. By entering user responses into a matrix, we have been able to measure user responses and track both negative and positive reactions to different aspects of the online reading tools. In addition to these fi ndings, we also discovered that users’ experiences with the online reading tools was infl uenced by their existing research methods, their familiarity with online research, and their expectations of online publishing. While many respondents felt that the “information environment” created by the online tools was benefi cial to their evaluation and understanding of the material, they also expressed some dissatisfaction with their experience. Some users questioned the relevance and usefulness of the contextual material retrieved by the online tools. Users were also concerned with the perceived credibility of research published online and the limited amount of freely available online material. The results of our study reveal both the potential strengths and perceived weaknesses of online reading environments. Understanding how users read and evaluate research materials, anticipating users’ expectations of the reading tools and resources, and addressing user concerns about the availability of online material will lead to improvements in the design and features of online publishing.", "article_title": "Digital Humanities ‘Readership’ and the Public Knowledge Project", "authors": [{"given": "Caroline ", "family": "Leitch", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Ray ", "family": "Siemens", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Analisa ", "family": "Blake", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Karin ", "family": "Armstrong", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "John ", "family": "Willinsky", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of British Columbia, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of British Columbia", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rmrcq20", "GRID": "grid.17091.3e"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
