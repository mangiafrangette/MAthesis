{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Traditional Chinese Phonology, lacking of alphabetic system of phonetic notation such as IPA, had to deal with large written materials in Chinese characters, and used Chinese characters as a tool to analyze sounds of words. This brings up a significant feature of its study, that is, the relationships of words’ sounds are more important than their phonetic values. Xìli án (literally: \"inter-link\") is one of the most important methods in traditional Chinese phonology. Its fundamental is to build networks of Chinese characters having same syllabic elements. This paper takes Xìli án of Fanqiè in  Guángyùn as an example to show how to use network analysis and visualization software to improve traditional Chinese phonology study.  In general, Chinese characters are monosyllabic. A Chinese syllable can be divided into three parts: the Initial (Shēngmǔ), the Final (Yùnmǔ), the Tone (Shēngdi ào). The final can be further subdivided into the Medial (Jièyīn), the Main Vowel (yùnfù) and the Coda (yùnwěi), while the Medial and Coda are optional.     Fanqiè is a Chinese method to indicate the pronunciation of a monosyllabic character by using two other characters. The first one, known as Fanqiè-Sh àngzì, has the same initial as the desired character, known as Bèiqièzì. And the second one, known as Fanqiè-Xi àzì has the same final and tone as Bèiqièzì. Here is an example. “端(du ān), 多(du ō)官(gu ān)切”. The Bèiqièzì is “端”. The Fanqiè-Sh àngzì is “多” indicating that the initial of “端” is “d”. The Fanqiè-Xi àzì is “宗” indicating that final of “冬” is “u ɑn” and the tone is “-”.  Naturally, any Fanqiè was meaningful when it was created, but may not keep its perfection as time goes by, due to phonetic changes. For example, “東(dōng), 德(dé)紅(hóng)切”. “德” still has the same initial as “東”, while “紅” has the same final but different tones. Thus, the systematic use of such Fanqiè in ancient rime dictionaries is an invaluable resource for the work of historical linguists.  Guangyùn is a Chinese rime dictionary compiled in 1008AD. It is a revision and expansion of  Qièyùn, the influential rime dictionary published in 601AD. It is generally accepted that  Qièyùn recorded the voice of Chinese at that time, maybe not as a spoken language, but rather how characters should be pronounced when reading the classics. So  Guangyùn, as the most accurate available account of  Qièyùn in the past, was used by traditional scholars as a major source on the reconstruction of  Qièyùn system, the code name of Middle Chinese.   Guangyùn is split into four tones in five volumes (Two for Píng tone, and one each for other three: Shang, qù, rù). Each tone is split into rimes, with total of 206 rimes (including final and tone). Each rime is divided into groups of homophonous characters, with a character as the representation, and the pronunciation of each group given in  Fanqiè formula.  It is Chénlǐ, in his masterpiece  Qièyùn-Kao published in 1842, who first introduced Xìli án method in the study of Fanqiè in  Guangyùn. The Principle of Fanqiè-Xìli án comes from the idea that the relation between Bèiqièzì and Fanqiè-sh àngzì or Fanqiè-xi àzì is an equivalence relation.  In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Any equivalence relation provides a partition of the underlying set into disjoint equivalence classes. Two elements of the given set are equivalent to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class. That means, if we look for the Fanqiè-sh àngzì of each Fanqiè-sh àngzì and link them together with one another, we can obtain equivalence class of Fanqiè-sh àngzì representing a same initial. By systematically applying this method, it becomes possible to make classes of Fanqiè-sh àngzì for the initials, and Fanqiè-xi àzì for the rimes (including the final and tone) of  Guangyùn. When two classes were unable to link each other by any method, it may conclude that they represent distinct initials and distinct rimes.    Figure 1: A page in  Guangyùn   In old days, Fanqiè-Xìli án of Guangyùn would cost a lot of time and the process is hard to display. So faced the same materials, researchers had to put lot of energy in repeating works to verify others’ results. It was often difficult to find out what went wrong when there were disagreements. Today, with the help of the network analysis and visualization software package like Gephi, it becomes much more easily to display one’s own work or review other’s work in both researching and teaching. Fanqiè-sh àngzì (or Fanqiè-xi àzì) are the nodes. The equivalence relation between them are undirected links. Then the components in the undirected network are equivalence classes of Fanqiè-sh àngzì (or Fanqiè-xi àzì) which represent different initials (or rimes).  The process is simple and repeatable. The first step is to convert the text of  Guangyùn to a structural form, see Table 1. The second step is to find the no repeated Fanqiè-sh àngzì (or Fanqiè-xi àzì) appeared in Guangyùn. The third step is to find the Fanqiè-sh àngzì of each Fanqiè-sh àngzì (or Fanqiè-xi àzì of each Fanqiè-xi àzì) in step 2, see Table 2. The fourth step is to transform the equivalence relations between Bèiqièzì and Fanqiè-sh àngzì or Fanqiè-xi àzì into links between nodes representing these characters. The fifth step is to convert those links in step 4 to a network with a network analysis and visualization software package, like Gephi, see Figure 2. The sixth step is find all the components in the network, Figure 3 shows an example.  However, it is not the end of our study of Middle Chinese Phonology, but only the beginning. Over more than 100 years, there is still no consensus on exactly how many initials and finals in Middle Chinese. The reasons are complicated, partly due to different versions of Guangyùn, partly due to various origins of Fanqiè in Guangyùn. Owing to digital method, it becomes much more convenient to demonstrate the works of key scholars and to locate the exact Fanqiè that caused their disagreements.
