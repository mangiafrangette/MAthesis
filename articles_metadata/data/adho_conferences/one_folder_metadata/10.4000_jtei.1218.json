Such authors are lost and their works are preserved only thanks to quotations and text reuses in later texts. The project is undertaking two tasks: (1) the digitization of paper editions of fragmentary works with links to the source texts from which the fragments have been extracted; (2) the production of born-digital editions of fragmentary works. The ultimate goals are the creation of open, linked, machine-actionable texts for the study and advancement of the field of Classical textual fragmentary heritage and the development of a collaborative environment for crowdsourced annotations. These goals are being achieved by implementing the Perseids Platform and by encoding the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, one of the most important and comprehensive collections of fragmentary authors.", "article_title": "The Linked Fragment: TEI and the Encoding of Text Reuses of Lost Authors", "authors": [{"given": "Monica", "family": "Berti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Leipzig", "normalized_name": "Leipzig University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03s7gtk40", "GRID": "grid.9647.c"}}]}, {"given": "Bridget", "family": "Almas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tufts University", "normalized_name": "Tufts University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05wvpxv85", "GRID": "grid.429997.8"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Dubin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Illinois Graduate School of Library and Information Science", "normalized_name": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047426m28", "GRID": "grid.35403.31"}}]}, {"given": "Greta", "family": "Franzini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Simona", "family": "Stoyanova", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Leipzig", "normalized_name": "Leipzig University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03s7gtk40", "GRID": "grid.9647.c"}}, {"original_name": "King’s College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Gregory R.", "family": "Crane", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tufts University", "normalized_name": "Tufts University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05wvpxv85", "GRID": "grid.429997.8"}}, {"original_name": "University of Leipzig", "normalized_name": "Leipzig University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03s7gtk40", "GRID": "grid.9647.c"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 8", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
