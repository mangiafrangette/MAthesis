Our project seeks to augment these approaches with computationallydriven analyses that can curate and aggregate the contents of tens of thousands of hours of television programming. Tracking these over the course of a scene and episode reveal characteristics of how characters interact and describe the narrative flow of the series. Figure 2. An example of scene classification from Bewitched. Each still image from the episode is tagged with the description of the sets on the sound stage. Following the progress of these over the course of the episode can serve as a way to compactly describe and aggregate the narrative arc of an episode. Comparing across episodes, seasons and shows reveals similarities and differences across the various series of interest.", "article_title": "Distant Seeing TV", "authors": [{"given": "Taylor", "family": "Arnold", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Richmond", "normalized_name": "University of Richmond", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03y71xh61", "GRID": "grid.267065.0"}}]}, {"given": "Lauren", "family": "Tilton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Richmond", "normalized_name": "University of Richmond", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03y71xh61", "GRID": "grid.267065.0"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
