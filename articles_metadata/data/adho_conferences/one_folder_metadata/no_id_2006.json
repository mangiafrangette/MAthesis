{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " This short paper will trace the roots of the digital humanities certificate option as it is now most commonly conceived, beginning with Lisa Spiroâ€™s 2010 post \"Opening Up Digital Humanities Education\" and then summarizing how her ideas were developed by scholars such as Lynne Siemens and Kara Kennedy in journal papers. It will then move on to examining how these ideas were put into different kinds of practice at institutions like Texas A & M University, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the University of Virginia, and finally it will turn to the author's own experiences as the developer of a digital humanities workshop series who then participated in an attempt to standardize it for university accreditation as part of a certificate program. Issues explored along the way will include faculty collaboration and labor equity, fair intellectual representation, the complexity that conversations about these assume, and conditions for librarians and campus partners to agree to when developing curricula together.
