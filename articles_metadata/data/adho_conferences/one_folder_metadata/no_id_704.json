In this presentation, we will discuss how working within such a radically interdisciplinary context has already led us to new insights about poetry, its features, and its operations. Our focus in this short paper will be not on the technology, but on how working collaboratively with visualization scientists has _in itself, independently_ of the technology, led us to new insights about poetry. For this reason, we argue, the practice of collaboration across the boundaries of very different disciplines has its own inherent value, even to a discipline like ours in which work and the “freedom to explore” has most traditionally been associated with solitude.", "article_title": "Solitary Mind, Collaborative Mind: Close Reading and Interdisciplinary Research", "authors": [{"given": "Katherine", "family": "Coles", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Utah, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Utah", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03r0ha626", "GRID": "grid.223827.e"}}]}, {"given": "Julie Gonnering", "family": "Lein", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Utah, United States of America", "normalized_name": "University of Utah", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03r0ha626", "GRID": "grid.223827.e"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["genre-specific studies: prose, poetry, drama, visualisation", "   ", "literary studies", "text analysis", "creative and performing arts including writing"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
