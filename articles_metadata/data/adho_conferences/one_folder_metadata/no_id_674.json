By comparing the topic modeling output of the Networked Corpus to eighteenth-century indices and commonplace books, we interrogate a historical notion of topical knowledge and the epistemological features of the \"topic\" in current topic modeling algorithms. In addition, we compare the statistical results from our comparison with the conclusions of traditional scholarly approaches to topical knowledge in the eighteenth century.", "article_title": "Eighteenth- and Twenty-First-Century Genres of Topical Knowledge", "authors": [{"given": "Collin", "family": "Jennings", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "New York University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "New York University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0190ak572", "GRID": "grid.137628.9"}}]}, {"given": "Jeff", "family": "Binder", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "New York University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "New York University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0190ak572", "GRID": "grid.137628.9"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "              ", "historical studies", "data mining/text mining", "literary studies", "corpora and corpus activities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
