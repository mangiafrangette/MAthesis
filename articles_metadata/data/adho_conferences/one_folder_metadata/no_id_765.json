Toward that end, I discuss the affinities between digital textual studies and SI. I present a case study of an early project in the history of humanities computing, Bessinger and Smithâ€™s A Concordance to the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, as a demonstration of the joint analytical power of textual studies and SI. The team formed various alliances with colleagues, vendors, publishers, and others during their project. Their collaboration cannot be explained without discussing such alliances, specifically the ways in which the ICTs used and made by the collaborators shaped and were shaped by disciplinary cultures and institutional contexts. Furthermore, by paying attention to the concordances linguistic and bibliographic codes, we can see evidence of a program of extreme automatization at work in their production.", "article_title": "Digital Textual Studies, Social Informatics, and the Sociology of Texts: A Case Study in Early Digital Medievalism", "authors": [{"given": "Grant Leyton", "family": "Simpson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["bibliographic methods / textual studies", "medieval studies", "media studies", "history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
