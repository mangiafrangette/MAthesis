{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "After the Great East Japan earthquake struck, the need for learning lessons from the vast amount of information has been increased in order for preparing the next Great earthquake. Therefore, the present study explores a method of displaying textual information of experiences and detecting narratives to learn lessons. We conducted two visualizations of database on the Great earthquakes and considered the outcome of each. We found that the outcome of one of the visualization was gaining factual information on phenomena, whereas the other that was designed to have future perspectives allowed to find the demands or views for the future as well as the facts in the past. If taking the perspective for extracting narratives and learning lessons, the outcome having future views is more contributing to gaining meaningful story. The future-oriented perspective would be recommended to add into the process of designing archive to learn lessons on natural disaster.", "article_title": "Possibilities of narrative visualization: Case studies of lesson-learned-oriented archiving for natural disaster", "authors": [{"given": "Akinobu", "family": "Nameda", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": "Kosuke", "family": "Wakabayashi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": "Takuya", "family": "Nakatsuma", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": "Tomomi", "family": "Hatano", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": "Shinya", "family": "Saito", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": "Mitsuyuki", "family": "Inaba", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": "Tatsuya", "family": "Sato", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["visualisation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
