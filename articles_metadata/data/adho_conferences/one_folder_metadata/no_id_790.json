{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Over the past decade humanities scholars have begun to seriously explore the potential of using 3D modeling software to reconstruct historic spaces and architecture. However, because of technological and design limitations, their works have tended either to feature visually rich environments that were closed and static, or more interactive and data driven spatial projects that failed to seize upon the potential of realistic 3D imaging. But now as 3D gaming engines are making it easier to display visually sophisticated virtual environments in browser windows in real-time, and to access and interface with large data sets, new possibilities exist for 3D reconstructions. Using both demos of historical reconstructions running live in the Unity 3D engine and mockups of future plug-ins, my presentation will present a model for the future of 3D historical reconstructions that bring a variety of data together, arguing for projects that are persistent, historical, collaborative, and curated.", "article_title": "A 3D Common Ground: Bringing Humanities Data Together Inside Online Game Engines", "authors": [{"given": "James Joel", "family": "Coltrain", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska, United States of America", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interfaces and technology", "spatio-temporal modeling", "geospatial analysis", "historical studies", "virtual and augmented reality", "anthropology", "games and meaningful play", "analysis and visualisation", "art history", "archaeology", "visualisation"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
