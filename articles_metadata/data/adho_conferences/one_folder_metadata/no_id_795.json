{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "SoundBox, a two-year project funded by the new PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge at Duke University, explores new ways of incorporating sound into digital scholarly productions. It does so primarily by hosting a series of \"provocations\" — that is, essays, experiments and events both digital and local — that challenge those who experience them to imagine a noisier form of scholarship. An archive of these provocations will be published online. This paper explores the project's goals and outcomes, and uses our experiences with SoundBox as a case study in how to incorporate Digital Humanities into the graduate curriculum.", "article_title": "Toward a Noisier Digital Humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Mary Caton", "family": "Lingold", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SoundBox Project, PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge, Duke University", "normalized_name": "Duke University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00py81415", "GRID": "grid.26009.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Darren", "family": "Mueller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SoundBox Project, PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge, Duke University", "normalized_name": "Duke University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00py81415", "GRID": "grid.26009.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Whitney", "family": "Trettien", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SoundBox Project, PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge, Duke University", "normalized_name": "Duke University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00py81415", "GRID": "grid.26009.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interdisciplinary collaboration", "digital humanities — pedagogy and curriculum", "project design", "management", "organization", "music"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
