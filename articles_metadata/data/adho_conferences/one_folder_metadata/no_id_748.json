{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Technologies allowing for gestural input and output have become more prevalent, e.g. the iPhone/iPad, Nintendo Wii and 3DS, and laptops with multi-touch-screen input and accelerometers to measure motion. However, there is a need to develop theory and technology for incorporating gestural technologies into expressive digital humanities systems applications. Toward addressing this need, we have developed new interdisciplinary theory and technology for expressive gestural interfaces based on insights from media studies, semiotics, psychology, human-computer interaction. In particular, we produced a platform for building interactive narrative systems that change emotional tone, theme, perspective, and other content elements in response to embodied user input on multi-touch devices. We have also produced scholarship that examines the philosophical implications and impacts of the use of these emerging technologies.", "article_title": "A Digital Humanities Approach to the Design of Gesture-Driven Interactive Narratives", "authors": [{"given": "D.
