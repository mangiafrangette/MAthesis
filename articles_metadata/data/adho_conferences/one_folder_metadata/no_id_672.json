{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "_Uncovering Reprinting Networks in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers_ seeks to develop theoretical models that will help scholars better understand what qualities—both textual and thematic—helped particular news stories, short fiction, and poetry “go viral” in nineteenth-century newspapers and magazines. Prior to copyright legislation and enforcement, literary texts as well as other non-fiction prose texts circulated promiscuously among newspapers as editors freely reprinted materials borrowed from other venues. What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences? By employing and developing computational linguistics tools to analyze the large textual databases of nineteenth-century newspapers newly available to scholars, this project will generate new knowledge of the nineteenth-century print public sphere.", "article_title": "Uncovering Reprinting Networks in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers", "authors": [{"given": "Ryan", "family": "Cordell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Northeastern University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Universidad del Noreste", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ahky613", "GRID": "grid.441462.1"}}]}, {"given": "Elizabeth", "family": "Maddock Dillon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Northeastern University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Universidad del Noreste", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ahky613", "GRID": "grid.441462.1"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Northeastern University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Universidad del Noreste", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ahky613", "GRID": "grid.441462.1"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["interfaces and technology", "linguistics", "data mining/ text mining", "geospatial analysis", "networks", "data modeling and architecture including hypothesis-driven modeling", "literary studies", "text analysis", "relationships", "corpora and corpus activities", "graphs", "content analysis"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
