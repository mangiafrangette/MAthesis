{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "The Book of Hours is perhaps the most ubiquitous type of surviving medieval manuscripts. Each unique book contains a wealth of information about liturgical practices, social and private use of books, manuscript production and decoration, and personal and local choices for the creation of private devotional collections. Each Book of Hours contains a Kalendar that lists feast days for the entire year. These document the standard days for liturgical celebration, but are filled with local and temporal variants that paint a picture of the ways in which practices change according to regional interests over the centuries. This paper describes the design and implementation of a comparative Kalendar built from distributed resources served from multiple participating tools and repositories.", "article_title": "A Comparative Kalendar: Building a Research Tool for Medieval Books of Hours from Distributed Resources", "authors": [{"given": "Benjamin", "family": "Albritton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stanford University Library, United States of America", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Sanderson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e41cf67", "GRID": "grid.148313.c"}}]}, {"given": "James", "family": "Ginther", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Saint Louis University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Saint Louis University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01p7jjy08", "GRID": "grid.262962.b"}}]}, {"given": "Shannon", "family": "Bradshaw", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Drew University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Drew University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04gds4h28", "GRID": "grid.255236.5"}}]}, {"given": "Martin", "family": "Foys", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Drew University, United States of America", "normalized_name": "Drew University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04gds4h28", "GRID": "grid.255236.5"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["historical studies, medieval studies, project design, organization, management, theology, bibliographic methods / textual studies, interdisciplinary collaboration, linking and annotation, standards and interoperability"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
