This appears to be possible by using a genealogical perspective that can recognize the underlying relationships between communication strategies that on the surface seem different. For this, it is necessary to identify the remote and unexpected ascendancies of diverse languages at a moment when the various media express themselves in an increasingly similar style. Even literary language should be considered a medium that shapes and models reality, using codes that are anthropological before they are aesthetic. As Viktor Shklovsky, Italo Calvino, and Paolo Fabbri have shown, literary language explores reality by revealing its incompleteness. On the contrary, ordinary language is confined to that incompleteness with its standard lexicon that would claim to enclose reality within a net of pre-established recurrences.", "article_title": "Dalla galassia digitale alla galassia Gutenberg", "authors": [{"given": "Arturo", "family": "Mazzarella", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universit√† Roma Tre", "normalized_name": "Roma Tre University", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05vf0dg29", "GRID": "grid.8509.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
