{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Despite the relative longevity of Digital Humanities (its origins are usually traced back to at least 1949, when Fr Roberto Busa, an Italian, Jesuit priest, began work on an index variorum of some 11 million words of medieval Latin in the works of St Thomas Aquinas and related authors) we know very little of its history. In this paper we focus on the key findings of the pilot stage of the ‘Hidden Histories’ project. We will demonstrate that Oral History is an important and productive methodology in such research and that it has resulted in the creation of primary sources that not only offer new information and interpretations of the field but that can also be used for further historical research.", "article_title": "Uncovering the “hidden histories” of computing in the Humanities 1949–1980: findings and reflections on the pilot project", "authors": [{"given": "Julianne", "family": "Nyhan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Anne", "family": "Welsh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["folklore and oral history", "history of Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
