It proposes and argues for the introduction of two separate transcripts: documentary and textual. Despite the apparent disadvantages of multiple encoding, this approach recommends itself for practical reasons (e.g., avoidance of overlapping hierarchies), and it conveniently reflects the idea that any written document must be considered a material object on the one hand and a medium of textual transmission on the other. In the course of the paper, some aspects and problems of chapter 11 of version 2.0.0 of TEI P5 (the definition and use of the elements <line> and <mod> and related issues) will be discussed.", "article_title": "Multiple Encoding in Genetic Editions: The Case of \"Faust\"", "authors": [{"given": "Gerrit", "family": "Br체ning", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Freies Deutsches Hochstift in Frankfurt on the Main", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "University of W체rzburg", "normalized_name": "University of W체rzburg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fbnyb24", "GRID": "grid.8379.5"}}]}, {"given": "Katrin", "family": "Henzel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Klassik Stiftung Weimar", "normalized_name": "Klassik Stiftung Weimar", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ad32n85", "GRID": "grid.461706.2"}}]}, {"given": "Dietmar", "family": "Pravida", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Goethe-Universit채t Frankfurt am Main", "normalized_name": "Goethe University Frankfurt", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cvxnb49", "GRID": "grid.7839.5"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
