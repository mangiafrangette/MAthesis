{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "In the context of digital paleography, we consider the key classification questions: when and where a given manuscript was written, and—if possible—by whom. A key challenge, given any system of descriptors, is that of attribute repeatability among documents of the same category. A descriptor that is marked as existing in a document is likely to exist; However, a descriptor might be unmarked due to an omission or simply because it is not present in the part of the manuscript that is available for inspection. In order to overcome this challenge, we suggest a new statistical tool that allows us to hypothesize which attributes should be turned-on and then perform classification on the augmented data.", "article_title": "Document classification based on what is there and what should be there", "authors": [{"given": "Noga", "family": "Levy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tel-Aviv University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Canadian Friends Of Tel-Aviv University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/029q31q54", "GRID": "grid.469710.d"}}]}, {"given": "Lior", "family": "Wolf", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tel-Aviv University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Canadian Friends Of Tel-Aviv University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/029q31q54", "GRID": "grid.469710.d"}}]}, {"given": "Peter", "family": "Stokes", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["other"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
