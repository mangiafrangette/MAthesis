{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "Collex is an online toolset designed to aid students and scholars working in networked archives and federated repositories of humanities materials: a sophisticated COLLections and EXhibits mechanism for the semantic web. It allows users to search, browse, annotate, and tag electronic objects and to repurpose them in illustrated, interlinked essays or exhibits. By saving information about user activity (including the construction of annotated collections and exhibits) as \"remixable\" metadata, the Collex system writes current practice into the scholarly record and permits knowledge discovery based not only on predefined characteristics or \"facets\" of digital objects, but also on the contexts in which they are placed by a community of scholars. Collex builds on the same semantic web technologies that drive MIT's SIMILE project and social bookmarking systems like Connotea and Zotero, but it also brings folksonomy tagging to trusted, peer-reviewed scholarly archives and features an integrated publication system. This exhibits-builder is analogous to high-end digital \"curation\" tools currently affordable only to large institutions like the Smithsonian. Collex is free, generalizable, and open source and is presently being implemented in a large-scale pilot project under the auspices of NINES.Collex is constructed with pragmatic scholarly needs in mind, and under the assumption that \"the general field of humanities education and scholarship will not take the use of digital technology seriously until one demonstrates how its tools improve the ways we explore and explain our cultural inheritance – until, that is, they expand our interpretational procedures\" (McGann, Radiant Textuality xii; my emphasis). Collex facilitates primary interpretive gestures of exploration and explanation in a broad and socially-networked manner, and aims to form a locus for further expansion of interpretive methods in digital humanities.The first formal iteration of Collex (released in February 2007) federates more than 60,000 digital objects of 19th-century literature, art, culture and criticism from the most prominent and acclaimed online journals, archives, and repositories in the field. This pilot project forms the core of NINES, the Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-century Electronic Scholarship, a trans-Atlantic federation of scholars and of peer-reviewed primary and secondary materials constituting a federated collective. Endorsed by the NINES steering committee and under development for the past year at ARP, the University of Virginia's Applied Research in Patacriticism lab, Collex is both the central clearing-house for NINES and the interpretive hub around which we hope a vital community of scholars and students will coalesce.Humanists eager to develop new ways to integrate and explore digital works currently lack crucial institutional and technical resources. Even the best models that scholars of (for instance) nineteenth century literature and culture now follow and imitate — the Whitman Archive, Romantic Circles, the Rossetti Archive, the William Blake Archive — are stand-alone projects that can only be loosely integrated through web browsers, even when shared through OAI protocols. As a consequence, what you see now on the web is what you get: an agglomeration of sites and projects whose content is atomized and whose scholarly and educational value is indeterminate. While it is possible for tech-savvy scholars, using ad-hoc tools and methods, to produce and distribute annotated, re-organized, or selected versions of existing online resources, they presently lack coordination within a peer-reviewed digital publishing environment. Because of this, their productions — personal web pages and online course packets — are difficult to maintain, are not readily interoperable or standards-compliant, and are easily dismissed as heterogeneous grab-bags of links. NINES was founded to work against this debilitating situation.The inherent complexity of available resources is a further obstacle to the penetration digital humanities into the disciplines. Collex is designed to aid humanities scholars doing research in complex digital collections like the Rossetti Archive(its initial test case) or within federated research environments like NINES. Such environments often stymie their users through the sheer quantity of information made available to them in top-level tables of contents, sitemaps, and idiosyncratic search engines. Our tool operates under the assumption that the best paths through a complex digital resource are those forged by use and interpretation. A Collex approach works to assist scholars in recording, sharing, and building on the interpretive purposes to which they put their online teaching and research environments.Collex uses semantic web principles and technologies to explore and develop the research potential of the digital scholarship aggregated in NINES. Two critical concepts embodied in a NINES environment shaped by the Collex application fall under the rubrics widely known as \"faceted classification\" and \"folksonomy.\" Facets and folksonomies structure an approach to descriptive metadata. They generate an evolving interface between the fully-integrated peer-reviewed electronic resources that constitute NINES and the user communities that re-imagine NINES content through interpretation, contextualization, and critical and creative re-fashioning.\"Full integration\" means that each of our NINES-participating resources has contributed a package of metadata representing all of the digital objects they wish to make browseable, collectible, and available to users for re-purposing within Collex. An important innovation of Collex lies in the way these objects are defined by their contributing editors. Collex uses a Dublin Core flavor of RDF, the \"resource description framework\" of the semantic web, to define collectible \"objects\" without limiting them to their expression as web pages. Where other social bookmarking tools are designed to allow collection and annotation of whole web pages, Collex allows contributors of resources to make finer-grained distinctions, and users of the system to build collections and exhibits more attuned to the patterns of attention in humanities scholarship.A clear example of interpretive modeling through object definition is the Collexrepresentation of a book of poetry in the Rossetti Archive. Using XSLT transformations, we have created RDF metadata for intellectual and material objects at differing levels in this book. One RDF object (typed as a secondary resource, with supplemental genre and date identifiers) expresses the editor's commentary on the book as a concept. Another object, also articulated in metadata, expresses one particular edition of the book. Within that high-level expression, each page of the book has been shared with Collexusers as a collectible object, as has each poem on each page. Such fine disambiguation ensures that Collex users can locate, annotate, and exhibit objects specifically suited to the scholarship they wish to perform – whether their attention is focused on bibliographic, social, or textual matters. It also ensures that archive maintainers have the fullest control, in the Collex environment, over the use of their intellectual property and the artifacts they minister.Because RDF objects share a common (and relatively simple) metadata scheme, they are discoverable through \"facets\" in the Collex search and faceted-browsing interface. Faceted classification is a non-hierarchical means of expressing ontological relationships. Any given object will share a number of facets with other objects – common dates, genres, authors, etc. Exposing these facets makes it possible not only for users to manually \"drill down\" into certain categories or explore lateral relationships, it also opens possibilities for algorithmic serendipity in research. In other words, Collex can exploit formally-expressed facets to offer more options and avenues to users interested in a particular object: \"more like this\" – more objects in the repository sharing one or more attributes with a researcher's subject of attention. Even more interesting is the ability of Collex to record and analyze user activity, and to translate the products of user interaction into RDF objects within the system itself. In this way, in addition to \"more like this,\" Collex can suggest to recent collectors of a particular object that they view the published collections and exhibits into which other users have placed the object, or objects like it. Because this content can be expressed as subscription-based RSS feeds, a web service, or an API, it is possible for the maintainers of scholarly resources to patch into Collex directly from their individual web page or listserv interfaces, offering information about user annotations and re-mediations for any given object without requiring users to visit Collex at all.All Collex activity takes place within the ordinary web-browsing environment that scholars presently use to access digital resources, and will require nothing in the way of plugins or downloads. The overhead (in terms of initial metadata production) for contributors of resources to the federated collections in which Collex can operate has also been kept purposely low, and is thoroughly compatible with Open Archives protocols. We predict that both of these factors – combined with the strong endorsement and example of NINES – will facilitate the adoption of Collex into day-to-day practices of humanities scholars in networked research and publishing environments.Screenshotspaper_152_nowviskie_1.jpgA Collex sidebar list view (user-collected objects in the \"visual art\" genre) with the same constraint in the faceted browserpaper_152_nowviskie_2.jpgA different constraints set, and a detail view of one object (for tagging, annotation, and knowledge discovery) in the sidebar", "article_title": "Collex: Facets, Folksonomy, and Fashioning the Remixable Web", "authors": [{"given": "Bethany ", "family": "Nowviskie", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Applied Research in Patacriticism University of Virginia", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2007", "keywords": ["folksonomy", "faceted browsing", "social bookmarking", "semantic web", "open archives"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
