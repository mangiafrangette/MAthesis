{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "With the aim of opening up a digital archive developed for researchers in illuminated manuscripts, we carried out a task-oriented evaluation with members of the general public. The main results regard the difficulties to involve non specialist in using targeted cultural heritage collections, which are likely due to a marginal interest towards the collection content. On the other hand, users showed a higher interest towards the research activities carried out on the digital content, including all the research process (sources, measurements, analyses). Thus we propose a shift in the focus of systems for managing cultural heritage digital collections: from tools for disseminating cultural content to tools for involving general users in goals, methods and results of scientific research on the cultural content.", "article_title": "An Evaluation of the Involvement of General Users in a Cultural Heritage Collection", "authors": [{"given": "Maristella", "family": "Agosti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Padua, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Padua", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00240q980", "GRID": "grid.5608.b"}}]}, {"given": "Lucio", "family": "Benfante", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Padua, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Padua", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00240q980", "GRID": "grid.5608.b"}}]}, {"given": "Marta", "family": "Manfioletti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Padua, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Padua", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00240q980", "GRID": "grid.5608.b"}}]}, {"given": "Nicola", "family": "Orio", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Padua, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Padua", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00240q980", "GRID": "grid.5608.b"}}]}, {"given": "Chiara", "family": "Ponchia", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Padua, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Padua", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00240q980", "GRID": "grid.5608.b"}}]}], "publisher": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "date": "2013", "keywords": ["sustainability and preservation", "repositories", "user studies / user needs", "archives"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
