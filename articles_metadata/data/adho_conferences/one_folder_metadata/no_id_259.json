{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": "IntroductionThe numerous visual metaphors that describe cognitive processes hint at the nexus of relationships between what we see and what we think. We say we ‘see’ when we mean we understand, we try to organize and make our ideas ‘clear’ by bringing them into ‘focus’, and so on. When faced with tasks that require substantial thought or organization of ideas we will often reach for a pen and paper to ‘sketch out’ (another visual metaphor) our thoughts. We have a deep understanding that we can enhance our thought processes by finding ways of linking external perception with our interior mental processes. Graphic aids to thinking are not new but the development of computers has provided a new medium with remarkable functionality. This in turn offers the potential for new research methodologies that amplify cognition. These tools serve two distinct purposes. One of these is often described by the hackneyed phrase “A picture is worth ten thousand words”.This is commonly believed to be based on a “Chinese proverb” however Paul Martin Lester believes that it was in fact made up by the advert writer Federick R. Barnard. See  and Printers’ Ink, March 10, 1927. This misses the true point of visualization as what is being described here is just a matter of transmission, of having high bandwidth to transmit large volumes of information. Of far greater importance is the ability of these tools to allow visual perception to be used in the creation or discovery of new knowledge. Knowledge is not transferred, revealed, or perceived, but is created through a dynamic process. This raises epistemological issues concerning visualization and points the way to an intellectual approach to the subject.Computer visualization techniques began as a methodology for understanding the meaning of large volumes of numeric data. Scientists needed a means of visualizing the flood of data that can be collected by modern monitoring and measuring instruments. The National Science Foundation initiative on Scientific Visualization launched in 1985 led in a very short time to Scientific Visualization becoming recognised as not just a methodology but a discipline in its own right. A similar trend may now be developing in the Humanities. For example the London Charter seeks to establish principles for the use of 3D visualization in research and communication of cultural heritage that ensure the intellectual integrity of the methods and outcomes derived from it. How is visualization being used in the humanities at the moment? Is there a potential counterpart to Scientific Visualization in the digital humanities – a field of ‘humanistic visualization’? What issues does it raise? Where is the common ground and what are the intellectual issues involved?Visualization in the Digital HumanitiesThere are many ways of structuring an examination of the use of visualization in the humanities; by discipline, by type of information structure and so on. To set the context for this paper I have chosen to look at the type of data that is being visualized. The boundaries of data types are sometimes blurred but a starting point could be as follows Numbers. Quantitative analysis and visualization has been an established tool in many humanities disciplines for a long time. It is found in generic statistical analysis software or embedded in specialised applications such as text analysis. It is gradually permeating into new areas of the humanities through work such as that of Franco Moretti (2005) who has argued for a wider application of quantitative methods in areas such as literary history.Text: Visualization techniques using tables and graphs have been commonplace in text analysis for many years. These visualizations are sometimes variants of statistical visualizations of numeric data (as in word frequencies) but in other cases they are specialised visual forms of text analysis. Projects such as the TAPoR and NORA Projects are developing imaginative new visual forms and applications. These new methods apply not just to the visual representation of the results of analysis but also to the visualization of the texts themselves. This aims to support interpretive scholarship by allowing areas or relationships of interest to be identified within large volumes of text. Projects have explored specific texts in this way, for example Dante’s Inferno , Hume’s Dialogues and The Shape of Shakespeare but there is substantial scope for a tool that could be applied to any text. The use of the word ‘tool’ here should not be taken to imply that this is a computational problem, this is far from the truth, as what is being grappled with here are conceptual problems. For example, what is a text? How should it be displayed visually? Humanities computing provides a medium with a myriad of possibilities of representation; uni-dimensional or two dimensional physical objects, abstract objects showing relations among words or between words and annotations, and animations. Further questions arise from this work; is there a need for representational as well as interpretive markup? What are the relationships between text visualization and the interpretation of texts? The visualizing of texts is also an area which links humanities computing work to the arts, for example the interactive installation Text Rain by Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv.Narratives and relationships. These can be grouped and referred to as diagrams . Edward Tufte has drawn public attention to this style of diagram; famous examples include the work of Playfair and Charles Minard’s narrative graphic of Napoleon’s ill-fated campaign against Russia in 1812. In many respects this has been a neglected field since the advent of digital tools because diagrams of this type are not easily implemented in software. They are also potentially of enormous value to the humanities as narratives and the study of relationships between people, events and artefacts are studied by many disciplines.Space. The study of spatial relationships and a sense of place occur in many humanities disciplines. This area is dominated by Geographical Information System (GIS) software but this was developed for scientific data and is not ideally suited to the qualitative data used in the humanities (Jessop, 2006). Digital dynamic maps are one of many alternatives offering media that are better suited to humanists (Jessop, 2006). The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) with its utilization of Timemap provides an indication of possible future developments.Time. Digital visualization provides a very powerful medium for temporal visualisation. Tools such as timelines allow one to explore the development of complex historical events and the inter-relationships between precursor events. They are of obvious value in the study of history where later events build upon earlier ones but they can also be applied elsewhere. Historiography and literary criticism are both histories of accumulated comments on a subject. Matt Jensen (2006) has developed a number of timeline tools which are intended to answer the styles of questions that are asked by humanists, for example in the case of political scandals questions of the style ‘who knew what and when’ or for exploring the response to an author’s writing over a period of many years3D Visualization. Much of this work has centred upon visualizations of the built environment. It is of interest to not only historians and archaeologists but also anyone who seeks to find out how the buildings of the past worked in human terms, for example the Pompey Theatre and Theatron projects are based on historical and archaeological data but are primarily of interest to scholars of theatre studies. 3D visualization is of especial interest in the context of this paper because there is currently great deal of work focused on defining not only good practice (see ICT Methods Network) but also principles for maintaining the intellectual integrity of such work, for example the London Charter. It may therefore provide pointers for similar work in the development of a broader humanistic visualization as a whole.Any demarcations between the applications of visualization between different disciplines are misconceived. There is much common ground offering considerable potential for humanities computing and the digital humanities. This is where we need to focus our attention if digital visualization is to achieve recognition as a rigorous intellectual activity in research and teaching.ConclusionWe accept that texts and documents are produced as readings resulting from acts of interpretation between the reader and the text; we now need to regard images in the same way. Every representation, visual or otherwise, is an effort to structure an argument and as such it is a rhetorical device. We need to understand the relationship between what is being communicated and how it is being communicated.Information graphics, and indeed images generally, can be considered as historical artefacts themselves, filled with interesting incidental and substantive information embodied in their production, style, and graphical properties. But perhaps more importantly, they are expressions of procedures for generating knowledge through the act of visualization and ways of displaying knowledge embodied in visual imagery (Drucker, 2003).Visualization addresses epistemological and pedagogical issues that are common to the digital humanities and are at the forefront of the developing discipline of humanities computing. This is a vast topic the main aim here is to identify some of the underlying intellectual issues arising from visualization and the use of images in digital humanities scholarship.", "article_title": "Digital Visualization as a Scholarly Activity", "authors": [{"given": "Martyn ", "family": "Jessop", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the HumanitiesKing's College London", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2007", "keywords": ["images", "digital humanities", "humanities computing", "visualization"], "journal_title": "ADHO Conference Abstracts", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
