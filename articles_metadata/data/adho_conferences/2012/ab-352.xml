                <p>This paper discusses the image of the vampire in the television series <hi
                        rend="italic">True Blood</hi> and the books by Charlaine Harris on which the
                    series is based. Our analysis is based on cultural imagology as developed by
                    Johnson (2005, 2006) and Lotman (1990). To this end we have used CATMA, the
                    concordance program developed at the University of Hamburg, and added multimodal
                    functionality to it. By time stamping and aligning the image, the soundtrack and
                    the subtitling, we can mark up and investigate both the linguistic and the
                    paralinguistic markers that describe the characters and their emotions. This
                    means that we are able to move between a concordance of the subtitling and the
                    film itself; in addition, we have linked the scenes of the film to the novels of
                    Charlaine Harris, on which the series is based. Thus, this paper not only
                    discusses the images created in the novels and the television series, but also
                    presents the tools we have built to enable us to carry out the research.</p><p>Beliefs and legends about vampires have existed probably as long
                    as mankind. The earliest known records are found among the Assyrians (Wright
                    2006). Lores and legends of some form of the vampire can be found all around the
                    world. The vampire has been described as an evil, bloodsucking creature, a force
                    of darkness. He is seductive, smart, and a powerful predator. Sometimes the
                    vampire is seen as a spirit; some legends say they can change into animals, even
                    control them (Nobleman 2007). Vampire literature began with the Gothic
                    tradition, a fiction that was intended to evoke a sense of dread in the reader.
                    During Victorian times the vampire became more human and a powerful archetype.
                    The common image, which began with Bram Stoker’s <hi rend="italic">Dracula</hi>,
                    was one of a gentleman dressed in evening wear and a long cloak; he was smart,
                    polite, wealthy and well-dressed. Of all classic horror creatures, he has had
                    the most sex appeal and has thus easily been able to attract humans. </p>
                <p>The image of the vampire has once again changed. He (or she) is now beautiful,
                    erotic, powerful, young and quite human-like. He has human emotions, is
                    dangerous when called for, but loving and good to those humans he is attached to
                    – a modern-day Heathcliff, a dark and brooding sexual fantasy. This is largely
                    due to Anne Rice, who changed the image of the vampire, and vampire literature
                    more generally, with her character Lestat. She achieved this by ignoring the old
                    conventions of what a vampire can or cannot do; she changed the traditional
                    Gothic settings by moving them from isolated houses and areas to central
                    locations and beautiful homes; she made the vampire the protagonist, thus moving
                    away from the more traditional narration by the victim, and focused on their
                    feelings and their anxieties, making them quite sympathetic (Overstreet
                    2006).</p>
                <p>We investigate the <hi rend="italic">True Blood</hi> television series and the
                    books it is based on. These were written by Charlaine Harris between 2002 and
                    2010, in other words well after L.J. Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Vampire
                        Diaries</hi> series and after the television series <hi rend="italic">Buffy
                        the Vampire Slayer</hi>, but before Stephanie Meyer’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Twilight</hi> series. True Blood features Sookie Stackhouse, a human in her
                    late twenties, a waitress in a local bar, and her relationship to Bill Compton,
                    quite the Southern gentleman, and Eric Northman, the Viking, two vampires who
                    are almost opposites of each other. We set out to investigate what kind of an
                    image the viewer gets of Eric; this we did through investigating the adjectives
                    used to describe him and those used by him. Thus our research questions were:
                    How do others perceive Eric? How does Eric behave? How does Eric perceive
                    others? How does he describe others? To carry out the investigation, we needed a
                    concordance program, but the problem of course was that there simply wasn’t one
                    that could also handle the video. Thus we turned to the CATMA team at Hamburg
                    University and asked whether we could use their program and build on it. We have
                    now built multimodal functionality on top of CATMA and carried out our
                    investigation on the speech of the series, calling up the video of each instance
                    in the KWIC concordance (see Fig. 1). We then marked up the text of the original
                    book series and linked the instances describing Eric in the book to those in the
                    TV series.</p>

                        <head>Figure 1</head>
                    </figure>Our results show that in the television series <hi rend="italic">True
                        Blood</hi>, there is little description of Eric; the viewer’s image of Eric
                    is shaped largely by comments made about his behavior, such as ‘Eric, you do not
                    humble well’ or ‘<hi rend="italic">I’m</hi> not afraid of Eric’ and ‘Eric has
                    had a thousand years of practicing deceit.’ However, the image of Eric is not
                    only constructed through this. In fact, the multimodality of the television
                    series plays a crucial role in the construction of the characters more
                    generally. Eric, for example, is created through the things he wears, the way he
                    speaks, the things he does and the expressions on his face. Sometimes, for
                    example, Sookie criticizes Eric harshly and his facial expression indicates that
                    he is quite hurt, although he does not say so. Thus it is crucial that in
                    addition to analyzing the actual speech of the characters, one can access the
                    visual images as well – much like in modern conversation analysis, which also
                    relies on sound and images, in addition to the actual words spoken. </p><p>Another interesting aspect of the investigation is the comparison of how
                    the image of Eric differs between the original novels and the television series.
                    It seems that much of what is conveyed to the viewer through the images in the
                    television series forms what in literary studies one would think of as that part
                    of the creation of a character in a novel which is left to the reader’s
                    imagination. It is like an interpretation of the character, perhaps even to be
                    seen as the actor’s interpretation, which then gets reinterpreted by the viewer.
                    The image of Eric is also created through the juxtaposition of him with Sookie’s
                    other lover, Bill Compton, who was turned into a vampire after the Civil War and
                    who is quite the Southern gentleman, particularly as opposed to Eric, who is the
                    rogue; he is the ruthless Viking, an absolute ruler, at times rather cruel, and
                    a sharp businessman. He is attractive to women, whom he uses ruthlessly, but he
                    is also very protective of those he really cares for, which often is not
                    reflected in the words he speaks, but rather in his facial expressions and
                    gestures. </p><p>Thus, it becomes evident that in order to carry out an analysis
                    of data such as this, it is crucial that one has access to tools which are able
                    to handle the multimodality of the data. Our decision to not reinvent the wheel,
                    but to build upon an already available tool, was the right choice, but there is
                    still work to be done to make it even more applicable to other data and other
                    types of investigations. </p>
