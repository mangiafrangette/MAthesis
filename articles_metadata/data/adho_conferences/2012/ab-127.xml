                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The Daozang jiyao project aims not only at providing a new text-critical edition
                    of an important collection of Daoist works, but also to serve as a research hub
                    to any research concerning the collection and indeed Daoism in China since the
                    18th century<note>The project was initiated and led by Monica Esposito (1962-2011), who’s sudden parting came as a shock to all involved in the project. Like all outcomes of the project, this presentation is dedicated to her memory.</note>.</p></div>
            <div>
                <head>The Daozang jiyao <foreign>道臧輯要</foreign></head>
                <p>The Daozang jiyao was first put together as a shorter compendium of the enormous
                    Ming Dynasty Daozang, a collection that features some 1500 texts in thousands of
                    scroll, hence its name, which translates as ‘Essential of the Daozang’. On
                    closer examimnation, only about 60 percent of the text are from the earlier
                    collection however, with much contemporary material added by the group around
                    Jiang Yuanting <foreign>蔣元庭</foreign> (style Yupu <foreign>予蒲</foreign>, 1755-1819), who reportedly added 79 texts not
                    contained in the Daozang of the Ming during the Jiaqing era (1796-1820). This
                    edition is still available at some libraries around the world, but inspection of
                    these holdings revealed that almost none of these editions are identical; the
                    texts included have been reshuffled, added or removed, woodblocks for missing
                    pages have been recarved and new material has been added. To complicated matters
                    even further, a reprint was done in Chengdu, Sichuan at the beginning of the
                    20th century, for which all text have been recarved according to the standards
                    of the time, which resulted in a great number of changes to the text and the
                    characters used for writing it. The collection now contains slightly more than
                    300 texts.</p>
                <p>The whole complexity of the textual tradition came only gradually to the light
                    through bibliographical research done by Monica Esposito and other project
                    members, but it become also clear that the digital edition should not only be
                    able to reflect the textual history accurately but should also be done in a way
                    that allows modern day scholars to make full use of the digital edition, which
                    meant that a modern text with normalized characters and modern interpunction had
                    to be produced as well.</p>
                <p>In addition to the digital text itself, a compendium with introductions to the
                    texts in English and Chinese, as well a detailed catalog that details the
                    content of the different editions are planned.</p></div>
           <div>
                <head>Towards a digital edition</head>
                <p>Given the rather limited resources of the project, an efficient editing routine
                    had to be established, some of which have been already reported in earlier
                    presentations (Wittern 2009, 2010a, 2010b, 2010c).</p>
            
                    <p><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">A multitude of workflows</hi></hi></p>
                <p>When the project started in 2006, a first draft of the text files would be made
                    by a partner institution, the Institute for Chinese Literature and Philosophy,
                    at Academy Sinica in Taiwan. In Kyoto, these text files were transformed to TEI
                    conformant XML markup and then proofread and collated in one single step.</p>
                <p>It proved to be very slow, first of all, because proofreading and collation are
                    very different activities that are not easily performed together, but also
                    because the editing of the XML source proved to be challenging for the members
                    of the project, who where mostly specialists in Daoist studies.</p>
                <p>As a remedy, the workflow of collation and proofreading was separated and
                    performed with a specialised web application, that would allow the operators to
                    see both the digital facsimile and the transcribed text on the same page. This
                    application was developed based on a new text model, that allowed convenient
                    handling even of characters, that could not be distinguished by there character
                    encoding; details of this can be found in Wittern (2010a).</p>
                <p>However, as it turned out, this was not yet the end of the work. For further
                    steps, including the collation and subsequent structural markup of the texts,
                    the web based user interface proved to be too limiting and time consuming to
                    use, so another solution had to be found. We were reluctant to go back to
                    editing the XML source, because that made it less convenient to align the text
                    with the digital facsimiles, so a specialieed editor was preferred.</p>
                <p>As it happened, around that time Emacs 23 was released, the first version which
                    truly supported Unicode (although for some of the more arcane characters, a
                    patch was still needed), so it became feasible to provide a customized interface
                    for collation and structural editing.</p>
                <p>Instead of trying to directly add the results of the collation to the XML file,
                    as has been tried at the beginning of the project, we used now the ideas
                    presented in Wittern (2011) to use the distributed version control system (DVCS)
                    git to maintain the different versions of the text in different <hi rend="bold"
                        >branches</hi> of the system and could thus easily align them. The
                    algorithms to collate the texts are then partly drawn from Schmidt &amp; Colomb
                    (2009), a working session with a text to be processed is shown in Figure 1.</p>

                 <p><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">Towards publication</hi></hi></p>
                <p>Both stages of the workflow, the web application and the Emacs bases solution have been built not only for internal use, but as a prototype for the eventual publication. This will not only allow us to make more efficient use of scarce resources, but also gives plenty of time to collect experience and improve the interface.</p>
                <p>The expected publication will thus have two faces:</p>

                 <xmt:uList>
                    <item>For the casual user, a web based digital edition will provide easy access to all features of the edition without the need to install specialized software or learn a new tool.</item>
                    <item>For scholars, who want to incorporate the texts into their own digital library and work on them using their own tools, a git repository will provide access to all ’branches’ of the edition and thus the full range of the established texts, including a normalized version.</item>
                    <item>A master XML version, which documents the text using TEI conformant text-critical markup will also be available through a repository.</item>
                </xmt:uList>
            
                <p>All of these editions will continue to be enhanced as the knowledge of the texts and their background increases. Since the texts are not simply made available for download, but are set up in a DVCS repository, not only can updates be integrated with local changes of users of the text, but they can make available other branches of the text through separate repositories.</p>

            <div>
                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>Most of the text studied in the Humanities, and especially the material which is
                    at the focus of this project, has come upon us through a long history of writing
                    and re-writing of the text. To fully understand the text requires also an
                    understanding of its tradition and the events that made it possible for us to
                    hold the text in our hand, which might be excavations and spectacular finds or
                    simply the steady and silent work of generations of curators and librarians that
                    preserved the text for us. To realize its full potential, the digital text will
                    thus not only try to reproduce one specific material edition, but allow the
                    reader to look at versions of the text as they existed at certain points in
                    history, so as to know what version of the text was current when it was read
                    (and quoted) by such and such person. At the same time, the text will also be
                    available together with other reference tools and research material in each of
                    the Scholar’s digital library or ‘labs’.</p>
                <p>Now, one of the real fundamental differences between digital text and printed
                    texts as we have known it for centuries is the fact that the latter is a <hi
                        rend="bold">single product</hi>, whereas a text in the digital medium really
                    wants to be seen in the context of all other texts, read in collaboration with
                    other readers, in short requires a <hi rend="bold">platform</hi> for scholarly
                    editions, a ’Scholar’s Lab’, rather than simply a desk to be put on. How such a
                    platform might be constructed and what it needs to do is a matter of heavy
                    debate at the moment; I hope to voice my views at the presentation of this
                    paper.</p>
