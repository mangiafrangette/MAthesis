                <p>Buddhist Hybrid Chinese is a form of Classical Chinese that is used in the
                    translation of Buddhist scriptures from Indian languages to Chinese between the
                    2nd and the 11th century CE. It differs from standard Classical Chinese of the
                    period in vocabulary (esp. the use of compounds and transcriptions of Indian
                    terms), register (esp. the inclusion of vernacular elements), genre (esp. the
                    use of prosimetry), and rarely even syntax (at times imitating the syntax of the
                    Indian original). Texts in Buddhist Hybrid Chinese are central to all traditions
                    of East Asian Buddhism, which is practiced in China, Korea, Japan and
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>No comprehensive linguistic description of Buddhist Hybrid
                    Chinese has been attempted so far and perhaps never will, due to the great
                    diversity between translation idioms that at times use different Chinese terms
                    for one single Indian term, and in other cases one single Chinese term for
                    different Indian terms. In as far as Buddhist Hybrid Chinese has been described,
                    the research generally concentrates on grammatical particles (e.g. Yu 1993),
                    single texts (e.g. Karashima 1994), single terms (e.g. Pelliot 1933) or even
                    single characters (e.g. Pulleyblank 1965). The stylometric study of Buddhist
                    Hybrid Chinese – as that of Classical Chinese in general – has only just begun.
                    Only since 2002, when the Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association (CBETA)
                    distributed the texts in XML are the canonical texts available in a reliable
                    digital edition.<note>The CBETA edition is an openly available digital edition of the Chinese Buddhist Canon (the texts can be downloaded in various formats at <ref target="http://www.cbeta.org/" type="external">http://www.cbeta.org/)</ref>.</note></p>
                <p>The Chinese Buddhist canon
                    was printed first in the 10th century and regarding texts before that date its
                    contents have been relatively consistent since then. The currently most widely
                    referenced edition (the Taishō edition, published 1924-34) is based on a Korean
                    edition from the 14th century. It contains ca. 2200 texts from India and China.
                    Due to insufficient and unreliable bibliographic information for texts
                    translated before the 7th century, the attributions to individual translators – 
                    where they exist at all – are often questionable. This again has an impact on
                    the dating of the early texts, as they are usually dated via their
                    translator(s). Since most stylometric methods, including those for authorship
                    attribution, were developed for European languages, they often rely on easily
                    parsable word-boundaries, which in the case of Buddhist Hybrid Chinese do not
                    exist. Our wider aim is therefore to develop methods to identify stylistic clues
                    for certain eras in Chinese translations from Indian texts. Can we, based on 
                    stylometric features, find a way to date Chinese Buddhist texts or at least to
                    meaningfully corroborate or contradict traditional attributions?</p>
                <p>In this study we have compared three translations of the same text, i.e. the <hi
                        rend="italic">Gandhavyūha</hi> section (ch. Ru fajie pin <foreign>入法界品</foreign>) of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Avatamsakamsūtra </hi>(ch. Huayan jing <foreign>華嚴經</foreign>). The <hi
                        rend="italic">Gandhavyūha,</hi> which contains a long narrative of the quest
                    of the young man Sudhana to visit spiritual teachers, was translated into
                    Chinese three times:</p>
                <p>T. 278 by Buddhabhadra <foreign>佛陀拔陀羅</foreign>et. al. (Chang’an 418-20 CE)</p>
                <p>T. 279 by Śiksānanda<foreign>實叉難陀</foreign> et. al. (Chang’an 695-699 CE)</p>
                <p>T. 293 by Prajña <foreign>般若</foreign>et. al. (Chang’an 796-8 CE)</p>
                <p>Our task in this
                    particular case was to develop an algorithm that can demonstrate that the T.278
                    was translated three to four hundred years earlier than T.279 and T.293, and
                    show which of its features can identify a translation idiom that is earlier or
                    at least different from that of T.279 and T.293. Can it be shown that the two
                    Tang dynasty translations (T.279 and T.293) truly are more closely related to
                    each other than to the translation from the Eastern Jin (T.278)?</p>
                <p>Our
                    approach here combines a general statistical weighing of n-grams with a focus on
                    grammatical particles (<hi rend="italic">xuci</hi> <foreign>虛詞</foreign>). A ranking of their
                    importance for our corpus must factor in occurrence as well as variance. The
                    algorithm must also provide for the fact that characters that function as
                    particles can also be used in nominal or verbal compounds. These instances must
                    be filtered out by applying a list of compounds from a large dictionary of
                    Buddhist terms (Soothill &amp; Hodous 1937). The algorithm for this is developed
                    in the first section.</p>
                <p>The following sections describe the sampling
                    procedure and the preparation of the corpus. Although ostensibly all versions of
                    the same Indian text, the three translations differ greatly in length, mainly
                    because the volume of the Indian <hi rend="italic">Gandhavyūha </hi>expanded
                    between the 5th and the 8th centuries.  To counter this problem and to produce
                    enough samples for our analysis, each translation will be divided into
                    sub-divisions of equal length. Then, the frequencies of grammatical particles in
                    these divisions will be calculated and used for defining the stylometric profile
                    of the three translations. We will therefore deal with text clusters on which we
                    can use Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which we have used in a previous
                    study (Hung, Bingenheimer, Wiles 2010). Using PCA on the extracted profiles and
                    plotting the values of first and second components in 2-d charts we are able to
                    discern clearly that T.279 and T.293 are closer to each other and more
                    distant/different from T.278. The two Tang dynasty translations seem indeed to
                    differ from the Jin dynasty translation in its use of particles, and the first
                    and second component of the PCA analysis result shows, which particles create
                    the distinction.</p>
                <p>Thus stylometric analysis can give us a better understanding of the translation
                    styles of Buddhabhadra, Śiksānanda and Prajña. All translators have several
                    other translations attributed to them and comparing their <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gandhavyūha</hi> translation to the rest of their corpus, and then again
                    their corpora with each other, could in the future help us to improve our
                    algorithms that ideally would be able to describe and demarcate the work of
                    different translators. The general aim is to get a first handle on the
                    quantitative analysis of the corpus written in Buddhist Hybrid Chinese and
                    extract significant features, which can then be used for a more accurate
                    linguistic description of the idiom.</p>
                <p>What the analysis does not account for is changes in the Indian text. The Eastern Jin translation was translated
                    from a somewhat different version of the Indian text than the two Tang
                    translations 300-400 years later. This does, however, not impact our analysis.
                    It is possible to distinguish how grammatical particles were used by different
                    translators, because they reflect different styles of Buddhist Hybrid Chinese,
                    which is what we are looking to describe.  Even taking into account that the
                    Sanskrit text of the <hi rend="italic">Gandhavyūha</hi> has evolved between the
                    5th and the 8th century, its grammar could not have changed to the degree as
                    there are changes in the translation idiom.</p>
