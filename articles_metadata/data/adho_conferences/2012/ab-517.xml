        <body>
            <p>Historically speaking, the fields of digital humanities and media studies have
                remained parallel at best, with the former anchored more in computational practices
                and technical competencies than the latter. However, recent work – such as Sharon
                Daniel’s ‘Public Secrets’ (2007), Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s <hi rend="italic">Planned
                    Obsolescence</hi> (2011), Matthew Kirschenbaum’s <hi rend="italic">Mechanisms
                </hi>(2008), Kari Kraus’s ‘Conjectural Criticism’ (2009), and Lev Manovich’s
                cultural analytics (2012) – suggestively troubles this parallelism. From the vantage
                of media studies, digital humanities allows scholars to shift from commenting <hi
                    rend="italic">about</hi> new media and technologies to constructing arguments
                    <hi rend="italic">with</hi> and <hi rend="italic">through</hi> them (McPherson
                2009: 120). Informed by claims from experience and anchored in embodied acts of
                building, digital humanities arguments necessarily become ‘hands on,’ and scholarly
                distance from technologies no longer holds. Meanwhile, media studies investments in
                cultural criticism and situated knowledge-making are increasingly important to
                today’s digital humanities practitioners, involved such as they are in multimodal
                communication (e.g., interactive visualizations, geospatial representations, rich
                exhibits, and gaming). For instance, Alan Liu argues that ‘digital humanities should
                enter into fuller dialogue with the adjacent fields of new media studies and media
                archaeology so as to extend <hi rend="italic">reflection</hi> on core instrumental
                technologies in cultural and historical directions’ (Liu 2012: 501, emphasis added).
                This fuller dialogue would enhance the field’s awareness of how work with
                technologies and data intersects with the relevant social, economic, and political
                issues of our time. Assuming those conversations are inevitable (and that media
                studies and digital humanities should continue to overlap and intersect), a key
                question thus emerges: what would be an appropriate platform for such forms of
                scholarly communication? How would it function, and under what assumptions about how
                digital humanities and media studies are practiced? </p>
            <p>With these questions in mind, this talk uses the author’s ongoing book project
                (tentatively titled, <hi rend="italic">How Text Lost Its Source: Magnetic Recording
                    Cultures</hi>) to present his findings on the yet-to-be-released Scalar
                platform. Supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the U.S. National
                Endowment for the Humanities, Scalar is designed for authoring and publishing
                multimodal books. Built using PHP ARC2 (a MySQL-based Semantic Web/RDF framework),
                HTML, CSS, jQuery, XLST, Dublin Core, and other ontologies including SIOC, it
                enables users to assemble media (e.g., audio files) from multiple sources and
                juxtapose them with their own writing. The platform particularly facilitates work
                with visual materials; however, it also lends itself to audio, which is central to
                the history articulated in <hi rend="italic">How Text Lost Its Source</hi>.
                Throughout the talk, ‘multimodal’ is preferred over ‘multimedia’ because the term
                stresses systems of ‘sensory or perceptual experience’ over the ‘means of conveying
                [or storing] a representation’ (Anastopoulou, Baber &amp; Sharples 2001). And in the
                particular case of a Scalar book, it assumes that: (1) attention behaviors such as
                reading, watching, and listening are not inherent to or determined by a medium, (2)
                digital communication frequently entails blending approaches to composition (e.g.,
                through images, audio, video, text, and databases), (3) layers of digital content
                are materially distinct and yet function relationally, and (4) scholarly
                interpretation demands several sensory modes (e.g., listening closely, scanning, and
                clicking).</p>
            <p>The author’s preliminary findings on Scalar show that, most importantly, it
                encourages reflexive approaches to the computational processes involved in digital
                humanities research. Influenced by the work of LaDona Knigge and Meghan Cope (2006)
                as well as Mei-Po Kwan (2002), the author organizes these findings according to how
                Scalar fosters: (1) exploratory research across multiple archives, (2) iterative and
                recursive argumentation, (3) an oscillation between abstract and concrete
                expressions, and (4) multiple interpretations of media and cultural history.
                Throughout, an emphasis is placed on juxtaposing critical writing with the critical
                use of audio in Scalar, including a few demonstrations of <hi rend="italic">How Text
                    Lost Its Source</hi>.  </p>
            <p>In the case of exploratory research across multiple archives, the platform is
                persuasive because it affords composites of text, audio, video, and images drawn
                from the various histories of magnetic recording, enabling the author to represent
                audio across the material specificities of multiple media (rather than reducing
                audio to simply sound or text). It also allows historical evidence to be modeled and
                exhibited independently of the author’s writing (e.g., audiences can navigate all
                audio files collected for the history without reading the author’s interpretations).
                However, any given audio file in a Scalar book can be annotated through discrete,
                time-stamped commentary by the author, and this commentary is displayed within the
                medium’s own temporality. While such features are now typical in visual culture
                (e.g., annotating lexia in Commentpress or tagging an image in Flickr), few such
                mechanisms exist for the scholarly treatment of sound.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Scalar facilitates iterative and recursive expression because it not
                only keeps a version history of all contributions and makes that history public; it
                also allows authors to duplicate media content (e.g., a magnetic tape recording) in
                another context and then re-evaluate it. Evidence in a scholarly argument thus
                becomes subject to constant re-visitation and re-use (e.g., the same tape recording
                is interpreted several times), underscoring the fact that media histories emerge
                from multiple (and often conflicting) perspectives, worldviews, and accounts.
                Importantly, these media – together with the author’s writing – are presented
                throughout a Scalar book both in the aggregate and in the particular. Using RDF/XML
                and D3.js dynamic visualizations, any single instance (i.e., anything with a URL) in
                the book can be situated in relation to the balance of the content. Consequently,
                the book’s historical materials are structured and expressed in such a way that they
                can be studied in isolation but cannot exist independently. And when a book is
                modeled effectively, its audiences can study complex cultural relationships (e.g.,
                between two audio files) established by the author. Importantly, such relationships
                are frequently constructed and encoded based on what has not been written or
                recorded in media history. While RDF/XML and D3.js help scholars organize and convey
                it, no computational practices exist (as of yet) for mining or visualizing implicit
                content, especially in the case of sound.    </p>
            <p>Finally, the Scalar platform excels at fostering various interpretations of media
                history by allowing audiences to – in the fashion of context-sensitive design –
                select how a book’s content is viewed. These views range from ‘text-only’ and
                ‘media-emphasis’ to a radial visualization, a force-directed graph, and a history
                browser. Again, this array of perspectives brushes against any totalizing account of
                media history, the cultural history of magnetic recording included. It also
                destabilizes a scholar’s authority over an audience’s interpretation as it allows
                them to arrange and re-arrange content. Such an emphasis on the constructedness of
                arguments is especially key in a moment when visualizations are gaining traction in
                the field. The dynamic juxtapositions of writing and media in Scalar – D3
                visualizations among them – actively demonstrate how our data and content are taken,
                not given (Drucker 2011). They also facilitate robust and often contradictory
                accounts of material histories, where scholars can: (1) argue with and through the
                media they study; (2) present material relationally and discretely, either with or
                without commentary; (3) author within a medium’s temporality; (4) exhibit the
                otherwise ignored processes of research and revision; (5) duplicate and interpret
                media in multiple contexts; and (6) underscore the contingent character of
                historical artifacts, to such an extent that any complete description of a given
                media object is difficult to say the least.</p>
