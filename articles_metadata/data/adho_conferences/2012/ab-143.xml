                <head>The Problem</head>
                <p>A translated work of literature is a collaborative effort even if performed by a
                    single translator, always haunted by the ghost of the author of the original.
                    The relationship between the two has been at the centre of mainstream
                    translation studies and in the discipline’s corpus-based and stylometric
                    varieties, as evidenced by a growing body of scholarship (Olohan 2005; Oakes
                    &amp; Ji 2012). Stylometric problems multiply when the term ‘collaborative
                    translation’ is taken to signify a joint rendering of a single author into a
                    different language by two (or more) translators, or by translator and editor
                    (Rybicki 2011). In general, stylometry based on multivariate analyses of word
                    frequencies successfully detects the author of the original – rather than the
                    translator – in translations (Rybicki 2010); sometimes, this success varies from
                    translator to translator (Burrows 2002a). It is only when translations of the
                    same author are compared is there any hope for stylometric machine-learning
                    methods to tell translator from translator (Rybicki 2012).</p>
                
                <p>This is exactly why this study focuses on a problem situated somewhat in the middle
                of the above, as collaborations between translators on a <hi rend="italic">single
                </hi>literary work are a fact in the publishing industry. In the Polish market, this
                is perhaps most famously evidenced by Maria and Cezary Frąc, responsible for the
                third Polish translation of Tolkien’s <hi rend="italic">The Lord of the Rings</hi>.
                It is notoriously difficult to obtain information on the reasons and details of such
                translatorial collaborations from either the translators or their publishers;
                usually, looming deadlines for lengthy popular novels are blamed (Kozieł 2011).</p>
                
                <p>But a collaborative translation can also be made for other reasons. When one of
                Poland’s most eminent translators, Anna Kołyszko died of cancer during her work on
                Virginia Woolf’s <hi rend="italic">Night and Day</hi>, leaving a finished draft of
                much of the book and some notes on additional sections, the translation was taken
                over by Magda Heydel, a particular specialist in Woolf (<hi rend="italic">Jacob’s Room</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Between the Acts</hi>, <hi rend="italic">A Moment’s
                    Liberty, On Being Ill</hi>), who also performed some editing on the entire text.
                As Heydel stated in a TV interview, it was for the readers to see whether there was
                or there was not a rift in the middle of the book where one translator took over
                from the other; she hoped her editing made the narration coherent as far as the
                style was concerned. She also emphasized the uniqueness of the translator’s
                experience to confront her own intuition of her voice in the text with that of
                another (Heydel 2011). Thanks to her previous work and research on Woolf, she had
                had quite a definite idea of what stylistic shape <hi rend="italic">Night and
                    Day</hi> should obtain in its Polish translation. Her linguistic image of
                Woolf’s style, being, as it to an extent must, rooted in her own idiosyncratic
                ‘feeling’ of the language, was also informed by tangible evidence in Woolf
                scholarship. The technique of the changing point of view, to be elaborated in
                Woolf’s mature work into the stream of consciousness, a very important achievement
                of the writer, is clearly visible already in this early novel. Recreating this
                aspect of her writing has always been one of Heydel’s central concerns. Also, her
                particular translation technique is to a large extent based on the idea of the voice
                of the speaker, with the actual reading aloud for the effect of naturalness as the
                ultimate test for a successful rendition. In Woolf the recognizable ‘voice’ of the
                focalizer is central as it produces the point of view in narration (Rait 2010). Thus
                the changes Heydel introduced into Anna Kołyszko’s text were not (or very rarely)
                lexical but mainly syntactical. She worked with the famously long and intricate
                Woolfian sentences, the more so that the Polish language, with its extremely
                flexible sentence structure, locates most of its rhetorical and pragmatic devices
                here. Also for this reason, most-frequent-word analysis was a well-suited approach
                to this experiment in translatorial attribution.</p>
                
            <p>Indeed, this seems a translatorial counterpart of David Hoover’s study on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tutor’s Story</hi>, a novel begun by Charles Kingsley and
                completed by his daughter Mary under her pen name Louis Malet, with some information
                available on who wrote what (Hoover 2011). In the Polish <hi rend="italic">Night and
                    Day </hi>case, this information is exact; in both cases, the early chapters have
                been written by the first, the final ones by the second translator. It is also
                reminiscent of an earlier study on the Middle Dutch epic <hi rend="italic">Walewein
                </hi>(van Dalen-Oskam &amp; van Zundert 2007). The main difference consists in the
                fact that Heydel is available to confirm or deny the findings of the quantitative
                analysis.</p>

            <head>The Method and the Corpus</head>
            <p>This study applies Cluster Analysis to Delta-normalized word frequencies in texts; as
                shown by (to name but a few) Burrows (2002) and Hoover (2004, 2004a), and despite
                limitations discussed by Smith &amp; Aldridge (2011), this is one of the most
                precise methods of ‘stylistic dactyloscopy.’ A script by Maciej Eder, written for
                the R statistical environment, converts the electronic texts to produce complete
                most-frequent-word (MFW) frequency lists, calculates their z-scores in each text
                according to the Burrows Delta procedure (Burrows 2002); selects words for analysis
                from various frequency ranges; performs additional procedures for better accuracy
                (Hoover’s culling and pronoun deletion); compares the results for individual texts;
                produces Cluster Analysis tree diagrams that show the distances between the texts;
                and, finally, combines the tree diagrams made for various parameters (number of
                words, degree of culling) in a bootstrap consensus tree (Dunn et al. 2005, quoted in
                Baayen 2008: 143-47). The script was demonstrated at Digital Humanities 2011 (Eder
                &amp; Rybicki 2011) and its ever-evolving versions are available online (Eder &amp;
                Rybicki 2011a). The consensus tree approach, based as it is on numerous iterations
                of attribution tests at varying parameters, has already shown itself as a viable
                alternative to single-iteration analyses (Eder &amp; Rybicki 2011b; Rybicki
                2011).</p>
            <p>The Woolf translation was analysed by comparing equal-sized fragments (at various
                iterations of fragment size) of the translation of <hi rend="italic">Night and
                    Day</hi> to determine the chapter where Heydel had taken over from Kołyszko;
                Heydel was consulted only after the initial determination had been made. At this
                point, the Kołyszko and the Heydel portions of the book were compared to other
                translations by Heydel (Woolf’s <hi rend="italic">Jacob’s Room</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">A Moment’s Liberty </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Between the
                    Acts</hi>, Graham Swift’s <hi rend="italic">The Light of Day </hi>and Conrad’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi>) and by Kołyszko (McCarthy’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Child of God</hi>, Miller’s <hi rend="italic">Tropic of
                    Capricorn</hi>, Roth’s <hi rend="italic">Portnoy’s Complaint</hi>, Rushdie’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Midnight’s Children</hi>), and then to an even more extended
                corpus of author-related translations.</p>

            <p>All iterations of different fragment sizes of the Kołyszko/Heydel translation pointed
                to the beginning of Chapter 27 as the place where Heydel took over the translation
                from Kołyszko. Figure 1 shows the attribution of medium-sized fragments
                (approximating, in this case, mean chapter length) of the translation. In fact,
                Kołyszko has completed 25 full chapters and left scattered notes on Chapter 26;
                these have been collected, organized and edited by Heydel. If we are to believe
                stylometric evidence, the latter made a very good job of preserving the style of the
                former, so that her own style is only visible in earnest in Chapter 27.</p>

                            Heydel’s translation of Woolf’s Night and Day, performed for 0-1000 MFWs
                            with culling at 0-100%. The beginning of fragment 27 of the translation
                            roughly coincided with the beginning of Chapter 27</head>
                    </figure></p>
   
            <p>Once the authorship of the translation of <hi rend="italic">Night and Day</hi> became
                    confirmed, it was possible to place this shared work in the context of other
                    translations by Heydel and Kołyszko; unfortunately, they never translated
                    different books by the same author. The consensus tree in Figure 2 is divided
                    neatly between Kołyszko and Heydel. In this context, the overall editing by
                    Heydel might be visible in that both parts of <hi rend="italic">Night and
                        Day</hi> remain in her section of the tree; this might equally be a result
                    of the original authorship, as the Woolf novels are close neighbours here.</p>
                <p>When more translations by the same authors but by other translators are added to
                    the corpus, the balance between translatorial and authorial attribution is
                    clearly shifted towards the latter. In Figure 3, five translations of Woolf
                    (including <hi rend="italic">Night and Day</hi>) by four different translators
                    occupy the lower branches of the consensus tree, with Bieroń’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Orlando</hi> being the only (relative) outsider. Kołyszko’s and Heydel’s
                    translations in the upper half of the graph cluster with translations of
                    respective authors by other translators.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>So far, attempts at finding stylistic traces of the translator or the editor have been only partially successful. Word-frequency-based stylometric methods have shown that they are better at attributing the author of the original than the translator (Rybicki 2009, 2010; Eder 2010) – as has already been stated, unless translations of a single author are compared. In the latter case, Burrowsian stylometry is quite capable of telling translator from translator.</p>
                <p>The translatorial attribution is greatly helped by the adoption of the bootstrap
                    consensus tree approach, which minimizes attributive errors due to unlucky
                    combinations of parameters as, simply speaking, Delta and similar distance
                    measures are more often right than wrong, but the proportion between right and
                    wrong might vary for a variety of reasons – especially language (Eder &amp;
                    Rybicki 2011b). This is particularly significant in a rare translatorial
                    attribution case such as the Kołyszko/Heydel translation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Night and Day</hi>, where the results of stylometric analysis can be
                    confirmed or denied by the translator herself. Equally importantly, this study
                    demonstrates that although stylometry seems to find traces of the author as well
                    as of the translator, these traces can be disambiguated by placing the disputed
                    translations in contexts of various corpora.</p>
