            <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Arguments for investing time and resources in digital scholarly editions are
                    often based upon the cultural and literary dignity of the authorship
                    (Shillingsburg 2004). In the case of Selma Lagerlöf, as in the case of for
                    example Ibsen, one can argue that her authorship is one of the most important in
                    Swedish literary history and one of the most well known internationally of all
                    Swedish authors. Following this line of argument, literary scholarly editions
                    tend to be focused on single, canonized authorships, and since letters to the
                    author and translations of his/her work are not usually included, the authorship
                    is represented in splendid isolation.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>From Work to Reception</head>
                <p>We will discuss why and how the Selma Lagerlöf Archive (SLA), which makes the
                    Selma Lagerlöf collection at the National Library of Sweden accessible and
                    provides digital scholarly editions of her work, aims to create a broader
                    historical context, including the intensive contacts within networks of European
                    women translators and writers which were important for her success in Europe.
                    What the research on Selma Lagerlöf until now lacks, is a more complete mapping
                    of these patterns of dissemination, and also, of course, evidence of reception
                    of her work in different countries. This has consequences for the Selma Lagerlöf
                    Archive too. Charting the translations is not a small task, and investigating
                    legal rights to be able to publish these translations online is perhaps even
                    more difficult. This also needs to be a collective effort, since the source
                    material is spread over Europe and written in different languages.</p>

                <head>Collaborative Methods</head>
                <p>The Selma Lagerlöf Archive’s participation in the COST Action ISO901 ‘Women
                    Writers in History: Towards a New Understanding of European Literary Culture’
                    (2009-2013), facilitates the discovery of unknown or forgotten connections
                    between European women in the literary field. By standardizing ‘author’ and
                    ‘work’, but not ‘reception’, the Selma Lagerlöf Archive and the <hi
                        rend="italic">WomenWriters </hi>database (<ref
                        target="http://www.databasewomenwriters.nl/" type="external">www.databasewomenwriters.nl</ref>)
                    can exchange information on these levels. ‘Reception’ is expressed as a relation
                    between ‘author’ and ‘work’. Thus the ‘author’ can function in different roles –
                    as ‘reader’, ‘critic’, ‘admirer’ etc. ‘Work’ can be specified by type –
                    ‘letter’, obituary’ etc. This is a flexible model, since it covers many
                    different kinds of research material, and there is no need to agree on a common
                    definition of ‘reception’, which would not be adequate for all research material
                    and research questions of the projects using the database.</p>
                <p>By way of microservices that are currently being developed, the metadata in the
                    xml-databases of SLA, can be shared within the agreed frame of Women
                    Writers-database, in addition to our other APIs. This collaboration benefits the
                    SLA in two ways. Considering the international reach of Women Writers-database,
                    it may function as an important output to the otherwise limited target group of
                    SLA. SLA can also collect the relevant data on translations or receptions
                    registered in the <hi rend="italic">WomenWriters</hi> database and thereby
                    making the time consuming task of finding and registering this information
                    unnecessary.</p>
                <p>The development of microservices follows the collective work carried out in COST
                    Action ‘Interedition’ (van Zundert 2011), where the Selma Lagerlöf Archive also
                    participated (although Sweden was not formally a member). The modular
                    microservices developed will vary in implementation language and platform, but
                    will be web-accessible to other services using REST-like interfaces. As for now,
                    the Selma Lagerlöf Archive has not yet developed any standard format tool for
                    visualizing the connections between European women writers, but evidently this
                    will be an important task for the future and a powerful method for rewriting the
                    European map of literary history.</p>

                    <head>Comparing Translations and Reception Documents</head>
                <p>An inventory of translations is a first step towards discovering the mechanisms
                    of dissemination of this – and other – authorships. But a qualitative analysis
                    of the translations to different languages and of reception documents such as
                    reviews, are also necessary for understanding the different national and
                    cultural contexts in which the authorship was used. A possible tool in the
                    qualitative analysis of the European translations of Selma Lagerlöf’s work is
                    the development of Juxta and CollateX, which was also previously carried out in
                    ‘Interedition’. The modularisation initiated in the previous COST Action ‘Open
                    Scholarly Communities on the Web’ known as the Gothenburg model, had the
                    objective to transform the collation from a ‘black box’ to a clear process with
                    discrete chainable steps.</p>
                <p>The web service versions of the collation step of Juxta and CollateX are
                    primarily used interactively for comparing variants of Selma Lagerlöf’s work
                    online within our own interface. But in addition to this, it allows for any
                    electronic texts to be compared, thus creating the possibility of comparing
                    different translations. Collation of translations is usually as laborious as
                    collation of variants, but in this way we can more effectively trace how Selma
                    Lagerlöf’s work has been transformed in different translations. Since the German
                    translations were often used as sources for other European translations (for
                    example to Czech and Russian), it is important to examine to what extent the
                    translations were rewritten to accommodate to the cultural climate. For example,
                    some of the German translations were explicitly directed towards the <hi
                        rend="italic">Heimatkunstbewegung, </hi>which can be described as a
                    precedent to the Blut und Boden-literature in the 1930s (Ljung Svensson 2011).
                    It is a question still unexplored, how this ideological rhetoric was translated
                    into other languages, nations and ideologies.</p>
                <p>The possibility of comparing electronic texts through collation may also be
                    applied for other purposes than showing the deviations between two editions or
                    translations. It can be used to discover similarities between texts. One
                    ambition of the COST Action ‘Women Writers in History’ is to bring data
                    together, which has, up until now, been dispersed among different archives,
                    physical and digital. This allows for a quantitative approach in estimating the
                    reach of female writers activities in Europe. The collected data will also be
                    used qualitatively, for example in exploring patterns in the reception of women
                    writers by critics, and if these patterns correspond to specific themes in the
                    literary texts. Provided that the reception documents (for example reviews) are
                    in the same language and in an electronic format, reviews might also be compared
                    through the microservices, in order to find out if certain ways of describing
                    female authors, or focusing on certain themes in their texts, recur. The same
                    method – although still at an experimental stage – may be used to compare texts
                    by different female authors as a shortcut to discovering common topics or
                    themes. The advantage of this method is that the researchers don’t have to know
                    beforehand what to search for, as when you search electronic texts for certain
                    keywords. Similarities may appear that researchers would not have imagined.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>In order to revitalize the field of scholarly editing, the author’s work must be
                    presented as nodes in cultural networks, involving different contexts and
                    countries, where the texts were received, used and transformed, as well as
                    different agents and institutions, participating in the dissemination of the
                    authorship. This kind of scholarly editing is feasible if existing databases and
                    tools are used to share and compare data. This method of working emphasizes both
                    the text as a social object and digital scholarly edition as a collaborative
                    activity (Robinson 2009).</p>
