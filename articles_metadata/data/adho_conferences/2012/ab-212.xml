        <body>
            <p>The silences endemic to the archive of slavery have long presented a range of
                challenges to the literary scholar: How does one account for absences in the
                archival record, both those inscribed in the archive’s contents, and those
                introduced at the time of the archive’s construction? How does one account for the
                power dynamics at work in the relationships between the enslaved men and women who
                committed their narratives to paper, and the group of (mostly white) reformers who
                edited and published their works? How does one identify and extract meaning from the
                unique set of documents that do remain – letters, inventories, ledger books, and
                personal narratives – documents that, in the words of Susan Scott Parrish, the
                literary critic, we must struggle to make ‘mean something more?’ (2010). And how
                does one do so without reinforcing the damaging notion that African American voices
                from before emancipation – not just in the archival record, but the voices
                themselves, are silent, and irretrievably lost?   </p>
            <p>This final, critical challenge is what has prompted scholars from across the
                humanities, such as the literary critics Stephen Best (2009, 2011) and Saidiya
                Hartman (2008), the sociologist Avery Gordon (2008), the archivist Jeanette Bastian
                (2003), and the historian Jill Lepore (1998), to call for a shift away from what
                Best has identified as ‘a logic and ethic of recovery,’ to a new focus, instead, on
                animating the mysteries of the past (2011). However, each of these scholars proposes
                traditional methods of analysis and criticism for animating such mysteries.     </p>
            <p>This short paper will instead draw upon a set of tools and techniques associated with
                social network analysis and visualization in order to propose a new method for
                animating the mysteries of the past. While social network analysis and visualization
                tools have been applied to literary texts (Drouin 2006-), historical datasets
                (Wilder 2010-), and correspondence networks (Findlen et al. 2008-), these tools have
                not yet been applied to historical archives with the aim of illuminating the
                relationships among people mentioned in the archive’s content.    </p>
            <p>For this task, I employed a named entity recognizer (NER) developed at Stanford, and
                included in its suite of CoreNLP (Natural Language Processing) tools, in order to
                identify the names of the people mentioned in the archive’s content (Manning et al.
                2010). I then developed my own co-appearance script, in Python, in order to
                determine which people were mentioned in the same document as each other, and how
                many times those people appeared together. I then formatted the data to be displayed
                using Protovis, a javascript-based visualization toolkit also developed at Stanford
                (Bostock &amp; Heer 2010).</p>

            <p> My paper will focus on a subset of documents included in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Papers of Thomas Jefferson</hi>, those that make reference to members of the
                enslaved Hemings family (Figure 1). The descendants of Elizabeth Hemings, including
                Sally Hemings, the woman with whom, whether consensually or not, Jefferson
                maintained a lifelong relationship and bore six of his children; and James Hemings,
                who trained as a <hi rend="italic">chef</hi> de cuisine in the high French style,
                and then worked as the head cook at Jefferson’s Monticello plantation until his
                emancipation, in 1796, function as an ideal test case both for assessing the limits
                of the computing methodologies employed, and for determining how the analysis and
                visualization of social networks can, in fact, animate the mysteries of the past –
                those that Best, Hartman, and others, have sought to identify and amplify through
                more traditional scholarly techniques.     </p>
            <p>A significant limit of employing NER software on this particular dataset is that
                enslaved men and women were most often referred to by first name alone. For
                instance, not only are there many Jameses mentioned in <hi rend="italic">The Papers
                    of Thomas Jefferson</hi>, but James Hemings was also called Jamie, Jimmy, and
                even <hi rend="italic">Gimmé</hi> while in France. After running my co-appearance
                script, I was required to go through the results by hand in order to determine which
                names referred to the same individual, and in that event, combine the associated
                data. Because of the eighteenth-century style of the Jefferson Papers, I was also
                required to remain attentive to any NER errors, as well as to individuals clearly
                alluded to in the Papers, but not referred to by name at all.     </p>
            <p>The test case of the Hemings family also points to the limits of the ‘arc diagram’
                model for visualizing complex relationships. While preferable to a force-directed
                layout, which obscures the distinct relationships among individuals, its layout
                implies a linearity that is not consistent with the web of relationships contained
                within the dataset. My paper will thus also propose how hive plots and chord
                diagrams might function as better models for visualizing such network data
                (Krzywinski 2009, 2011). In this way, I will suggest how contemporary data
                visualization research can have a direct impact on a range of literary and cultural
                investigations.    </p>
            <p>Furthermore, by demonstrating how a visualization of this particular social network
                allows us to see the historical traces of the Hemings family as presences, not
                absences, as scholars such as Best, Hartman, Gordon, Bastian, and Lepore, have each
                argued for, I begin to address an issue of mounting concern within the community of
                digital humanities scholars, as voiced by Johanna Drucker (2009) and Alan Liu
                (2011), among others, about the need to reinscribe humanistic inquiry as the central
                focus of digital humanities work. The presence of the Hemings family in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Papers of Thomas Jefferson</hi>, as unearthed by the methods
                described above, suggests not only how digital tools might be applied to a diverse
                set of cultural and literary questions, but also how these methods might expose –
                and animate – the diversity of experience embedded in significant records of early
                American cultural life.  </p>
