            <p>The technological demands of today’s global society call into question the use of traditional approaches to language and
                    literary studies and challenge educators to think about ways to integrate
                    multimedia creatively in their scholarship and teaching. The project presented
                    in this paper and currently under construction offers an innovative approach to
                    studying literature that employs tools from the field of the digital
                    humanities.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Comprehensive Digital Glossary of Golden Age Spanish
                        Literature</hi> or <hi rend="italic">GALGO</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                        >GoldenAgeLiteratureGlossaryOnline</hi>) is a searchable Spanish-English
                    online glossary that consists of select words, from the most commonly studied
                    literary texts of the 16th and 17th centuries, whose meanings and multiple
                    connotations reflect important linguistic and cultural concepts. The selection
                    of words is broadly consistent with the <hi rend="italic">keyword theory
                    </hi>developed by Raymond Williams in the mid-20th century. Keywords are lexical
                    units that comprise a network of associations, triggering ‘different memories
                    and imaginings,’ centered around dominant cultural notions and practices (Hart
                    et al. 2005: 6). Keywords illustrate ways of perceiving the world and reflect
                    the shared interest or ideology of a particular society and find expression in a
                    common vocabulary (Williams 1983: 15). Analyzing keywords is an exercise in
                    examining their usages in context and in considering the evolution of their
                    meanings over time (Burgett &amp; Hendler 2007: 1). Keywords research is rooted
                    in historical semantics and focuses on how meaning is constructed and altered
                    through conflict and negotiation among certain social groups and movements; it
                    is about exploring the possibilities of language and unlocking meaning.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">GALGO</hi> is a vocabulary of
                    keywords that explores the canonical prose texts of Golden Age Spanish
                    literature – <hi rend="italic">El abencerraje</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Lazarillo
                        de Tormes</hi>, Miguel de Cervantes’ twelve <hi rend="italic">Novelas
                        ejemplares</hi>, and principal <hi rend="italic">comedias</hi> by Calderón
                    de la Barca, Cervantes, Lope de Vega and Tirso de Molina – from the perspective
                    of a history of ideas. The digital glossary tags socially charged words that
                    reverberate through the texts and beyond. The glossary stimulates students to
                    evaluate critically their own assumptions and reflect on philosophical and
                    ethical questions that continue to be of current importance. The polysemic
                    nature of the terms selected, words such as <hi rend="italic">esfuerzo</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italic">fuerza</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gentileza</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="italic">honra</hi>, offers valuable insight into the complex,
                    idiosyncratic Golden Age Spanish lexicon. We believe that identifying the
                    different uses of the same word in a literary work is both essential to reading
                    comprehension and to an understanding of societal attitudes of the period.</p>
            
            <p><hi rend="italic">GALGO</hi> is organized in such a way that the specific
                    contextualized definition is given in each instance where the keyword is tagged.
                    The literary works have been digitized and are available in the glossary in
                    complete electronic versions. The box containing the definition can remain open
                    and is moveable, and users are able to compare and contrast immediately the
                    word’s varied meanings in the text. Furthermore, with the support of a search
                    algorithm, the glossary’s multilayered design gives students the option to view
                    the same keyword in all of the texts in the database. GALGO also contains a
                    Javascript snippet that will highlight and group together each distinct
                    definition of a search term across texts, thereby allowing students to chart the
                    prevalence of a particular usage of the word.</p>
            <p>The methodology of <hi
                        rend="italic">GALGO</hi> combines the rich word inventory of literary
                    concordances with the ideological interpretations of medieval and early modern
                    manuscript glosses. The entries reveal a word’s different shades of meaning and,
                    borrowing from the exegetical tradition popularized in the Middle Ages, function
                    as brief explanatory notes that give broader significance to literary passages.
                    For example, in the novella <hi rend="italic">El abencerraje</hi>, the noun <hi
                        rend="italic">gentileza</hi> and its adjective form <hi rend="italic"
                        >gentil</hi> are defined in the following ways, depending on the context:</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="italic">gentileza</hi>:</p>
                    
               <p>Unrequired goodwill shown by the more
                    powerful to the less powerful (magnanimity).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic"
                        >gentil</hi>:</p>
                <p>1. Of cultivated manner and appearance.</p>
                <p>2. The best of its kind (exemplary).</p>
                
                <p>When necessary, an additional feature called <hi rend="italic">Expansion of meaning</hi> appears alongside the
                    definition in order to identify further semantic connections. The entry for <hi
                        rend="italic">honra</hi> in the line ‘…<hi rend="italic">tuyo es mi corazón,
                        tuya es mi vida, mi honra y mi hacienda</hi>’ from <hi rend="italic">El
                        abencerraje</hi> reads:</p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Definition</hi>: Public esteem received in acknowledgement of one’s strength of character, specifically
                    here, a woman’s chastity and/or marital fidelity.</p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Expansion of meaning</hi>: In this period, honor (good reputation) was
                    based on the following factors: social status, material wealth, strength of
                    character, achievements, and in the case of a woman, her chastity and/or marital
                    fidelity. Here, in pledging <hi rend="italic">vida</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                        >honra</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">hacienda</hi>, the noblewoman was
                    committing everything she was and had to the man.</p>
            <p>By integrating qualitative analyses of literary texts with quantitative computer
                    derived methods, <hi rend="italic">GALGO</hi> promotes a novel form of active
                    reading and engagement in language and culture. In the last two decades, the
                    pedagogical approach to foreign language study has moved beyond a primary
                    emphasis on developing functional communication skills to an equally compelling
                    interest in acquainting students with representative literary and cultural texts
                    in the target language. <hi rend="italic">The Modern Language Association</hi>’s
                    2007 report places the acquisition of transcultural and translingual
                    competencies, namely the ability to reflect on how realities are shaped
                    differently across languages, historical periods and cultures, at the core of
                    the foreign languages discipline. <hi rend="italic">GALGO</hi> engages learners
                    in the analysis of classic literary texts in a meaningful way, allowing them to
                    test their hypotheses as to possible lexical and cultural preconceptions through
                    immediate feedback.</p>
