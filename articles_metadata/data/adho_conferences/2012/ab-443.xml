            <p>A number of research infrastructure projects are
                    currently constructing the next generation research environments for digital
                    humanities (Wynne 2010; ESFRI 2011). They are also conducting activities to
                    interact with potential users, early adopters and key multipliers in the field.
                    With this paper, we report on our experience of conducting such activities at
                    the local institutional level in order to (1) identify potential users, to (2)
                    survey their needs and current practice with regard to digital humanities, to
                    (3) try and stimulate them towards adopting research infrastructures where
                    appropriate and, (4), where the case, to identify remaining barriers. We report
                    on our work in progress that is taking these communicative activities to the
                    local level of several humanities faculties of a large German university.
                    </p>
                <p>Research infrastructures (Wittenburg et al. 2010; ESFRI, 2011) are
                    complementing a portfolio of established models of supporting computationally
                    intensive research processes in the humanities: (1) the professional
                    intermediary and (2) competence centers (Edmonds 2005; McCarthy &amp;
                    Kirschenbaum, 2003). Some recent infrastructure initiatives have already engaged
                    in bringing research infrastructures to the user, for instance TextGrid and
                    D-SPIN (Binder et al. 2010), others have contacted prospective users to sharpen
                    the research infrastructures’ visions and priorities (e.g. Herold et al. 2010).
                    We believe that these activities need to be complemented at the local levels of
                    universities as well and thereby taking a local perspective on the users and the
                    conditions under which they are carrying out their research activities.</p>
                <p>A consideration of the local perspective has two initial foci: The first one lies
                    on general local conditions. These are conditions concerning the local status
                    quo and local infrastructures in digital humanities (henceforth: DH). The second
                    focus has to lie on the local user itself, or better: potential or real users of
                    DH infrastructures, their knowledge about DH infrastructures, their attitude
                    towards DH infrastructures, their requirements and wishes, especially concerning
                    local support structures. Consecutively, a consideration of the local
                    perspective has to lead to an appropriate local DH infrastructure strategy. In
                    the following, we will outline the questions which have to be considered in an
                    analysis of the local perspective, and the methods which can be used for this
                    analysis, before we will conclude with the elements of a local DH user strategy.
                    </p>
                <p>An analysis of the local conditions should begin with a detailed analysis
                    of local DH-related research activities: What is already happening (maybe
                    without naming it DH)? Which current and past projects have an affinity with DH?
                    Who are the experts? Which DH support structures already exist, and which
                    current and future roles do local libraries and computing centers have? Methods
                    to be used in this stage are web-based inquiries (on current and past research
                    activities and on existing DH support structures) and expert interviews (on
                    current and future DH strategies). In a second step, it is necessary to further
                    shed light on the (potential or real) users of DH infrastructures, e.g. the
                    local researchers in the humanities. Do they know about existing national and
                    international DH infrastructures? Do they use national or international DH
                    infrastructures? Do they cooperate with DH centers? Which attitude do they have
                    towards DH infrastructures? Which apprehensions or hopes do they have? What
                    requirements and wishes concerning DH infrastructures do they have? Expert users
                    should also be asked whether they are willing or able to serve as professional
                    intermediaries for their local colleagues. This survey on local users should
                    differentiate between experts and non-experts. This could be realized by a
                    qualitative analysis of interviews with two kinds of groups, an expert group and
                    a non-expert group. Furthermore, an online-survey could be used to quantify the
                    findings of the qualitative study.</p>
               <p>The analysis of the local conditions and users may then be used to develop a local DH user-strategy which should
                    include elements like local community building, local public relations
                    activities and local support structures. Several such elements have already been
                    described and implemented in DH infrastructure projects and initiatives like
                    TextGrid, D-Spin, CLARIN, and DARIAH. Established community building events like
                    summer schools (e.g. Binder et al. 2010), or the THATCamp series, can also be
                    instantiated as light-weight events, such as a local ‘Data Day’
                    (Woutersen-Windhouwer 2011). Instruments such as newsletters or mailing lists
                    can be used and adapted for local contexts. Apart from these existing event
                    types and strategic elements, a local perspective on DH infrastructures should
                    also be complemented by local support structures like a DH competence center and
                    local professional intermediaries.</p>
                <p>At the Justus-Liebig University
                    Giessen, we conducted a survey of the local DH-related research activities and
                    local DH support structures. We found that more than 25 ongoing or recently
                    completed projects in two of five faculties for humanities could be regarded as
                    DH related projects. This is a surprisingly large amount of projects, if you
                    consider the size of the faculties observed. For the categorization procedure,
                    we defined digital humanities with regard to methods and digital practices.
                    Projects which are classified as DH related projects therefore have to use
                    computer-based methods (e.g. ‘Die Ordnung von Wissen in Texten’), use or produce
                    digital linguistic corpora (e.g. ‘English as a lingua franca in science and
                    business communication’), digital archives (e.g. the ‘Prometheus’ image
                    archive), digital editions (e.g. the digital edition ‘Chronik des Gettos Lodz
                    Litzmannstadt’), or other digital material (e.g. ‘e-campus Altertum’).
                    </p>
                <p>The crucial point is that most of these projects do not define themselves
                    as DH projects, which is fatal if you want to build up a local digital
                    humanities community. This finding, which complements previous observations and
                    discussions (e.g. Joula 2008; Svensson 2010; Prescott 2012), is most important
                    for a local DH strategy. What has to be done first, is to make researchers aware
                    that they are already working in the field of digital humanities, and that they
                    could gain a lot from identifying themselves as part of a local and global DH
                    community. We think that this first step, becoming aware of the field of digital
                    humanities and becoming aware that one is already part of the game, is one of
                    the most underestimated and at the same time most important points, if we would
                    like the digital humanities community to grow and if digital humanities research
                    infrastructures should be used by more researchers than at present time.</p>
