                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>This paper proposes the importance of developing a realistic theoretical
                    framework for the rise of mass digitization: the importance of the diffusion of
                    innovations in shaping public opinion on technology; hyperbole and the myth of
                    the ‘digital sublime’ (Mosco 2004); and the role of different media in shaping
                    human understanding. It proposes that mass digitization can only be viewed as a
                    significant deviation from the print medium when it emerges from the shadow of
                    the Gutenberg Press and exerts a similarly powerful paradigm of its own, and
                    that as a result there is a disconnect between the reality of the medium and the
                    discourse with which it is surrounded. </p>

                <head>Research context</head>
                <p>In recent years companies such as Google have generated huge interest in their
                    attempts to digitize the world’s books. Described by Crane as ‘vast libraries of
                    digital books’ (2006), they provide a powerful future vision where books exist
                    within a digital version of the mythical universal library. Yet we know very
                    little about what to do with these books once they are digitized, or even how
                    they are being used by researchers and the wider public. The contemporary debate
                    is defined by hyperbole and the belief that digital texts will inevitably
                    destroy the print paradigm, a discourse that reflects the rhetorical direction
                    of many historical reactions to technological change.</p>
                <p>At the same time, a new research method which Moretti labels ‘distant reading’
                    (2007) allows researchers to undertake quantitative analysis of these massive
                    literary corpora using tools such as the Google Ngrams Viewer<note><ref
                            target="http://books.google.com/ngrams" type="external"
                            >http://books.google.com/ngrams</ref></note>. Important work on these
                    corpora has been carried out within the Digital Humanities community, such as
                    projects by Jockers (2011) and Cohen (2006), and further research is being made
                    possible by Digging into Data<note><ref target="http://www.diggingintodata.org"

                    However, as we shall argue below, it is vital that we understand the theoretical
                    background of such research, and its potential effects on scholarly methodology
                    in both DH and traditional literary analysis.</p>

                <head> Quantitative methods and theories of technology</head>
                <p>Rogers (2003) tells us that far from being a deterministic inevitability, the
                    success of a new technology relies in no small part upon external human factors.
                    The role of opinion leaders is essential to this, and in the case of mass
                    digitization the literature is filled with examples of the fetishization of both
                    print and digital technologies. Gurus and promoters tell us that digitization
                    will improve the world, and render obsolete what has gone before; others express
                    concern about the cataclysmic effects that new technologies may have on humanity
                    (Mosco 2004: 24). The result is a powerful narrative of ruptures and dramatic
                    change, a myth that is historically common yet rarely reflected in reality.</p>
                <p>This narrative has been shaped by a debate that has spanned decades (Benjamin
                    1936; McLuhan 1962; Barthes 1977; Baudrillard 1994; Lanier 2011), and so it is
                    essential to consider the influence that theorists have exerted on the
                    contemporary debate, and the misconceptions that have arisen as a result. For
                    example, McLuhan’s conception of a global village, a ‘single constricted space
                    resonant with tribal drums’ (1962), is at odds with our experience of the
                    contemporary World Wide Web. The village operates in a semi-closed system with
                    clear boundaries, whereas the Web is unprecedented in its scale and openness. It
                    more accurately resembles the loose structure of a modern city, and therefore
                    mirrors the behavioural changes that have been noted in residents of large
                    cities. With increased access to information comes an increased opportunity
                    cost, the sense that whatever a person does will necessarily involve missing out
                    on something else potentially useful (Deutsch 1961: 102). Accordingly, we can
                    see that both city dwellers and web users exhibit similar behaviour in filtering
                    and sorting the mass of information to which they are exposed. As a result of
                    this promiscuous, diverse reading style (Nicholas et al. 2004) the authorial
                    voice has been side-lined, and the growth of a specific cultural movement that
                    hyperbolises quantitative analysis of literary corpora threatens to hasten this
                    process.</p>
                <p>Many of the quantitative methods we have already seen hold great potential as
                    research methods (Cohen 2006; Jockers 2011; Michel &amp; Shen 2010; Moretti
                    2007), but there is a wider social discourse that appears to have taken
                    quantitative analysis as a sign that traditional methods have, as with print,
                    become an unnecessary distraction. This culture has redefined the content of
                    texts as information, in an overly literal interpretation of the death of the
                    author that undermines both authority and context. Information, viewed in this
                    manner, is an abstract entity analogous to computerized data and therefore open
                    to the same methods of interrogation (Nunberg 2010). There is no doubt that
                    quantitative analysis holds great potential when combined with close reading,
                    but we have witnessed a rhetoric that argues that close reading becomes
                    unnecessary when large data becomes available (Anderson 2008). What appears to
                    be a revolutionary faith in mass digitization, though, disguises a deeply
                    conservative technological determinism that is reflected in the manner that
                    digitization still so closely remediates the print medium.</p>
                <p>Instead of acting as a disruptive force, mass digitization borrows greatly from
                    the print medium that it remediates, a feature common to technologies in the
                    early stages of their development (Bolter &amp; Grusin 1996: 356-357). Even
                    quantitative analysis can operate as a confirmatory method; rather than creating
                    new knowledge it often acts only to confirm what humanities scholars already
                    knew. The digital form, then, still operates ‘not as a radical break but as a
                    process of reformulating, recycling, returning and even remembering other media’
                    (Garde-Hansen et al. 2009: 14). The reality is that quantitative methods are
                    most effective when used alongside the close textual reading that allows us to
                    contextualize the current glut of information. Yet the high speed processing of
                    huge numbers of texts brings with it a potential negative impact upon
                    qualitative forms of research, with digitisation projects optimised for speed
                    rather than quality, and many existing resources neglected in the race to
                    digitise ever-increasing numbers of texts. </p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>We must therefore learn more about the potential, and limitations, of large-scale
                    digitization in order to ensure that a focus on quantity rather than quality
                    does not override the research needs of the wider community. If accepted,
                    therefore, this paper will present some of the results of Gooding’s on-going
                    doctoral research into the use and impact of mass digitization projects, which
                    will include case studies from institutions such as the British Library. It will
                    argue that we must look beyond the noise that characterises the theoretical
                    framework proposed above, and learn more about how the true impact of mass
                    digitization. </p>
