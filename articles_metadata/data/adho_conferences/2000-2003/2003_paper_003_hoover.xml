                <p>Authorship attribution typically seeks a small number of textual characteristics
                    that distinguish the texts of authors effectively from each other (see Morton,
                    1978 for a classic discussion). With small groups of texts, these features can
                    be found by examining frequency lists manually, but statistical tests such as
                    the t-test can also be used (see Binongo and Smith, 1999). For the purposes of
                    authorship attribution, a few items occurring at consistent and consistently
                    different frequencies in all of the known texts by all of the claimants may be
                    sufficient for confident attribution.</p>
                <p>Most multivariate authorship work focuses on frequent words, following the lead
                    of Burrows (1987, 1988, 1989, 1992a, 1992b, 1994). Much persuasive recent work
                    continues this tradition (Craig, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c, 1999d; Forsyth et al.,
                    1999; Holmes et al., 2001a, 2001b; McKenna and Antonia, 2001; Tweedie et al.,
                    1998). In two recent studies, however, I have shown that cluster analyses based
                    on frequent words often fail to attribute known texts to their authors, and that
                    analyses based on word sequences are sometimes more effective (Hoover, 2001,
                    2002). Continuing along these lines, I will test the accuracy of analyses based
                    on collocations, while simultaneously examining the effects of using much larger
                    numbers of items than are typically used. Large numbers of words, sequences, and
                    collocations provide more information for potential stylistic analyses, assure
                    that the results take into account a large proportion of the texts under
                    consideration, and, as we will see, usually produce more accurate results. The
                    results of my investigation also show that analyses based on collocations are
                    often more accurate than those based on frequent words or sequences.</p>
                <p>For this investigation I will define collocations simply as any two words that
                    appear repeatedly within a certain span of words. Preliminary tests show that,
                    perhaps contrary to intuition, meaningful collocations like house...yard, or
                    car...highway, are not very effective for authorship attribution. They do not
                    occur very frequently, and their occurrence depends too much on the content of
                    the text. Many multivariate analyses have been based on function words alone, in
                    the belief that such frequent and relatively insignificant words are most likely
                    to reflect unconscious and regular authorial habits. This suggests the use of
                    collocations of function words, but preliminary tests show that these are also
                    not very effective. The most effective collocations are simply those that occur
                    at the highest frequencies, with the exception of collocations of personal
                    pronouns, which, like collocations of meaningful words, seem too much
                    conditioned by content (especially the characters) of the texts. I omit personal
                    pronouns and any items for which a single text provides more than 80% of the
                    occurrences (typically proper names).</p>
                <p>To test the effectiveness of collocations in authorship, it seems best to begin
                    with a corpus of texts by known authors, so that various spans, numbers of
                    collocations, and statistical methods can be tested for effectiveness before
                    trying the method on real authorship questions. I begin with a corpus of 10,000
                    words of pure narrative from fourteen third-person novels by six authors from
                    about 1900, and, as a baseline, test the effectiveness of frequent words and
                    sequences. For the restriction to narrative and to third- person, see Burrows
                    (1987, 1992) and Hoover, (2001). The best results cluster the texts of five of
                    the six authors. Although analysts usually select a small number of items (e.g.,
                    the 50 most frequent function words), much larger numbers of frequent words are
                    often more effective. I test the 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800
                    most frequent items except where fewer items than 800 occur frequently enough to
                    be included. (For this corpus, the best results for frequent words are based on
                    the 300-800 most frequent.) When collocations are tested, various spans and
                    linkages give various results, but several analyses correctly cluster the texts
                    of all six authors, as Fig. 1 shows. A representative completely correct cluster
                    analysis is shown in Fig. 2.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Fig. 1</head>

                    <head>Fig. 2</head>
                </figure>
                <p>It seems useful to test the methods on another genre, as I did in previous work
                    (Hoover, 2001), so my next corpus consists of the first 4,000 words of
                    twenty-one contemporary literary critical articles by ten authors. Here,
                    analyses based on frequent words and sequences each correctly cluster all of the
                    texts once. Analyses based on collocations with spans of two, five, and ten
                    words also succeed.</p>
                <p>Analyses based on collocations seem to be quite effective in attributing texts to
                    their authors in cases of known authorship, and can now be tested in an
                    authorship simulation to see how well they work under conditions that more
                    closely resemble true attribution problems. The simulation includes the fourteen
                    narratives by six authors discussed above, adds four novels by two new authors,
                    and then two “anonymous” novels, each known to be by one of the eight authors.
                    Frequent sequences succeed for only six of the authors. Frequent words still
                    fail to cluster Kipling’s texts correctly, but they do successfully cluster the
                    four texts of the two new authors. They also consistently cluster one of the
                    anonymous texts with Cather’s texts and the other with London’s. Analyses based
                    on collocations with a span of four words are extremely effective and
                    consistent: the 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 most frequent correctly cluster all
                    of the known texts, even when the graphs are strictly interpreted, as Fig. 3
                    shows. Like analyses based on frequent words, these also consistently cluster
                    the anonymous texts with those of Cather and London. These identifications are
                    correct. What makes these results even more impressive is the fact that four of
                    the six added texts, including the two anonymous ones, are first-person rather
                    than third-person narratives.</p>

                    <head>Fig. 3</head>
                </figure>
                <p>The results of my study confirm what many researchers have found: analyses based
                    on the frequencies of frequent words are quite effective in attributing texts to
                    their authors. Analyses based on frequent sequences of words are also often
                    effective, and are more effective under certain conditions, as I have showed
                    elsewhere (Hoover, 2002). Frequent collocations, however, are often more
                    effective than either words or sequences, producing the only completely correct
                    attributions in some cases and producing more consistently correct attributions
                    in others. The frequencies of frequent collocations clearly reflect important
                    aspects of authorial style. Analyses based on them constitute a promising method
                    of authorship attribution and may also prove useful in stylistic studies.</p>
