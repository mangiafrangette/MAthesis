<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This proposal reports on a research project, funded by a British Academy small 
  grant to investigate the history, development and institutional context of a 
  range of digital resources and computing projects in the humanities. This history 
  is very recent, but rich and realtively neglected, except for Hockey, (forthcoming). 
  The most long lived of such projects have existed only since the early 1970s. 
  However, the pace of technological and institutional change has caused rapid, 
  dramatic changes in this period. This research therefore aims to provide an 
  analytical history of the field and its developments, placed within the context 
  of institutional infrastructure and that of government policy and funding structures. </p>


<h3>Context </h3>

<p>The work began with a pilot project undertaken at the Department of Information 
  Studies, University of Sheffield. (Warwick and Carty, 2001) Research was based 
  on a small sample of projects on the History of Science: the Hartlib project, 
  (University of Sheffield); the Darwin Correspondence Project, (University of 
  Cambridge); the Robert Boyle project (Birkbeck College, London); the Mueller 
  Correspondence Project and the Newton Project (Imperial College, London). Interviews 
  conducted during the pilot project established the need for a of history of 
  such projects which would place them in the context of the broader field as 
  it has developed from the 1970s to the present. </p>

<p>Humanities computing (HC) projects may collaborate with a University Library, 
  Computing Services, or Research Centre. However, in many cases they comprise 
  small teams of academics, working on a limited budget. Although the teams make 
  every effort to document technical decisions that they make, they were concerned 
  about a lack of time to construct a history of the project, whether oral or 
  written. </p>

<p>Researchers feared that they were working in isolation from other teams, since, 
  especially in the early days of development, many scholars working in the area 
  were unaware of each others' existence. As a result valuable knowledge may be 
  not be shared. Similar difficulties might be encountered, and solutions developed 
  without the benefit of others' hard won experience, costing valuable time and 
  resources. (Hunter, 1995, Flanders, 2000) These problems have been ameliorated 
  by advice from bodies such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Yet, given 
  the diversity of material in the Humanities, many projects worried about whether 
  they had applied the TEI dtd 'correctly' in the mistaken belief that others 
  found this easy. </p>

<p>Research teams also shared a corpus of knowledge and experience about broader 
  factors affecting the academic progress of each project, and how it was related 
  to the broader scholarly, human and institutional context. Such knowledge was 
  being lost, and many thought that it ought to be preserved, not only as a record 
  of early work, but also as a resource that future researchers might draw upon 
  when planning new work. </p>

<p>It became apparent therefore that there was a need for research into this area. 
  This should not only be technical in nature, since what documentation exists 
  tend to be in he area of technical decisions. (For example Leslie, 1990, Lucas 
  and Short, 1999, Pearn, 1999) .The research described in this proposal therefore 
  concentrates on less tangible factors such as the reasons for beginning the 
  project, problems encountered, changes and developments that took place, the 
  response of more traditional researchers in the humanities and how the result 
  of the work were integrated into libraries and scholarship in the humanities. 
</p>

<p>In the pilot project, those interviewed thought that such research should be 
  done by someone from outside individual projects, libraries or e-text centres, 
  so that a comparative view could be developed. This research therefore aims 
  to analyse trends and problems, and to chart how the history of the sector has 
  developed. </p>


<h3>Methods </h3>

<p>In order to acquire rich qualitative data which can be examined in depth, (Patton, 
  1990) representatives from a sample of projects were interviewed. Documentation 
  provided, or articles written about the project have also been consulted.</p>


<h3>Sample choice</h3>

<p> The sample was chosen to represent the diversity of the field and to provide 
  a comparison between work in the USA and the UK. Because of the small scale 
  of funding it has not been possible to carry out research in continental Europe, 
  but this is anticipated for a future grant application. The small size of the 
  pilot study allowed us to come to very tentative conclusions. A wider range 
  of projects has therefore been consulted. Respondent in the pilot study had 
  stressed the important influence of HC centres and government bodies, so research 
  was carried out not only on individual projects, but also on larger HC centres 
  and with representatives of bodies such as the Arts and Humanities Data Service 
  (AHDS) and the Resource Discovery Network (RDN). These have been chosen to reflect 
  the following criteria. </p>

<h4>Size</h4>

<p>Interviews undertaken reflected the difference in scale between small individual 
  and digital libraries such as the E-text Centre at the University of Virginia. 
  HC centres tend to provide an overarching structure for a variety of projects. 
  It was therefore important to examine how such centres have developed, and how 
  smaller projects relate to them. Location: Our original research concentrated 
  on projects in the UK. However, some of the most important developments in HC 
  have happened in the USA. It is vital to gain a comparative perspective on this 
  area, and the way that transatlantic collaboration has begun to take place. 
  Research was therefore carried out at Brown University Scholarly Technology 
  Group, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) and the 
  Center for Digital History (CDH) at University of Virginia, the Perseus Project 
  at Tufts University and the Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities (CETH) 
  at Rutgers University. These have been compared to UK centres such as the Humanities 
  Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII) at the University of Glasgow, 
  Oxford University Learning and Research Technologies Groups (formerly the Humanities 
  Computing Unit), the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Kings College 
  London, as well as individual projects such as The Perdita Project at Nottingham 
  Trent University. </p>

<h4>Age</h4>

<p> The projects that began in the 1970s, such as the Oxford Text Archive, often 
  developed on an adhoc basis with little funding. This is different from recent 
  initiatives, funded by research grants and systematically managed, such as the 
  LEADERS project at UCL. Comparison of such projects was therefore made to determine 
  what effect the age of the project has on its procedures, and how the framework 
  under which it operated might affect its research. </p>

<h4>Purpose</h4>

<p>Digital resource collections have been designed to serve different purposes. 
  Some, like the Oxford Text Archive (OTA), historically had little sense of collection 
  policy, aiming to collect as much heterogeneous material as possible. Others 
  concentrated on one particular writer, or type of resource. Some were created 
  for teaching, or to further a particular kind of research. This research therefore 
  aims to investigate what impact these different purposes had on the development 
  and life of the resource. </p>


<h3>Findings</h3>

<p>At the time of writing the proposal the interviews are being completed. Should 
  the paper be accepted, findings can be discussed more fully, and will be presented 
  under the headings discussed above. However, prelimary results suggest that 
  the issue of funding and administrative structures has been vital to the development 
  of projects and HC centres. They also indicate a marked difference between UK 
  and USA examples. USA projects are typically more developed before seeking external 
  research grant, due to the availability of funding from their own university. 
  The vision of the university in which HC is undertaken was also vital and when 
  this changed so did that of projects in HC. This is so noticeable that the title 
  of this paper is a direct quotation from an interviewee reflecting on such a 
  change in policy. It is clear that HC centres play an important part in shaping 
  individual projects, and where local support was absent, despite government 
  funding and central advice, problems of the non-use of standards and a lack 
  of awareness of good practice are still noticeable. Unresolved issues included 
  how to communicate with and gain respect for HC research from the more traditional 
  scholarly community, and how researchers and academics should be rewarded for 
  such work within traditional promotion and remuneration structures. </p>


<h3>Relevance to conference themes</h3>

<p>Although all those interviewed in this study speak English, the paper nevertheless 
  addresses cultural differences between the USA and the UK and the manner in 
  which HC work is carried out, funded and supported by institutions. The research 
  also applies empirical methods from information studies, and social science 
  (ie the analysis of qualitative interview data) and aims to consider the institutional 
  role of HC within the contemporary academy. </p>
