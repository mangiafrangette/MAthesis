<h3>"Critical Gaming in the Arts and Humanities": Session Proposal by <br>
<i>Neil Fraistat</i>
<br>
</h3>
<p>


Audiences in London during the summer of 2002 could participate in Chris Hardman's Euphorium, an interactive virtual-reality theatrical production based on Coleridge's visionary poem, "Kubla Khan." Constructed as a gamelike maze with ten interlinked "environmental chambers," this installation allowed one person to enter every three minutes, wearing a special helmet that projected images in the space before their eyes, images representing portions of the poetic text. [slide] These images moved, combined, and reshaped themselves, accompanied by sound effects, in a kaleidoscopic multimedia experience meant to embody something of the poem's hallucinatory language in a 3D physical and virtual environment: STC on Ecstasy, as it were.</p>
<p>
Michael Heim and others have theorized such immersive spaces, including, for example, the surround-sound projective environment of the CAVE, created at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory of the University of Illinois, Chicago, which was created as a tool for extremely high-end scientific visualizations, but which provided a model that could bring a whole new meaning to the phrase "getting into the text," as the Cave at Brown University has recently demonstrated. Indeed, Robert Coover and a group of creative writers at Brown have already experimenting in this direction. An article in the New York Times for August 19, 2002 describes these experiments as "another step in electronic writing's evolution from a set of digitally interconnected words and sentences to an enveloping experience that augments the text with sound, video and nearly tangible 3-D imagery." As the article explains, "Viewers can watch as words materialize and swirl through the air around them, or they can step into a rotating cube to see an E. E. Cummings quotation that has been digitally inscribed on two of the walls." In one 3D short story, words on the wall peel away as they are clicked on by a mouse, floating through the air and returning into the text in random places, changing the meaning of a sentence, or making nonsense of it. Such experiments suggest that we may one day see literary VR theaters, for example, in which Shelley or Joyce scholars make and share discoveries about the text while standing inside of Prometheus Unbound or Ulysses. </p>
<p>
Such experiments also invoke the kind of cinematic, imaginative immersion produced by the best videogames. The fact is that Virtual Reality chambers, installation art, and immersive games grew up together in the 80s and 90s, and all three have always arguably "remediated" and "intermediated" one another. That history is complex and has only begun to be explored by critics such as Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin, Espen Aarseth, and Lev Manovich. For the most part, however, humanities scholars remain ignorant of the widely practiced medium of digital gaming. Many of us tend to collapse all of them into a vaguely aggregated genre, the "video game," rather than differentiating them, as we should, by technology platforms and narrative or other formal schemes.</p>
<p>
This is not the place for a taxonomy of digital games, but the session I am proposing would take seriously Jerome McGann and Johanna Drucker's recent claim that "Humanities scholarship without gameplay, even when the scholarship explicitly devotes itself to self-reflection, inevitably fails to engage with essential features of the works it means to study, including the workings of the mind engaged with such works." The three papers in this session will explore the new possibilities available to humanities scholars for structuring virtual game spaces that engage users and programmers in the kinds of critical self-reflection and performativity called for by McGann and Drucker, ranging from a paper by Geoffrey Rockwell on the Ivanhoe Game (designed by McGann and Drucker) and Rebecca (designed by Rockwell and Steve Ramsey), to papers by Ron Broglio and Steven E. Jones on experimental immersive games situated in the Villa Diodati MOO of Romantics Circle (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040903094252/http://www.rc.umd.edu:7000/>">http://www.rc.umd.edu:7000/&gt;</a>) that focus on the poetry of William Blake and Percy Bysshe Shelley, respectively. </p>
<p>
The proposed session is a follow up to a very successful one given by the same presenters at the Conference of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism last August.  It is also intentionally designed to serve as a complement to the one that Geoffrey Rockwell is proposing on "The Study of Games and their Culture." We are hoping that the two sessions, if accepted, could be run back to back.

<h3>
Paper I The MOO as Arcade: a minimalist, social, setting for interpretive gameplay
<br>
<i>Steven Jones and Neil Fraistat</i>
<br>
</h3>
<p>

In D. B. Weiss's recent comic novel, Lucky Wander Boy, classic video games from the arcade era act as interpretive texts, giving meaning to the first-person narrator's sadly funny geek life. The old-school arcade becomes in the novel a kind of utopian space, an alternate reality, a library of Babel, a realm of the imagination and the senses, and a source of sympathetic magic. Running behind this comic plot is a serious argument for the superiority of "cool" minimalism over "hot" realism in gameplay environments, which for us, raises the important question of whether graphical realism is a counter-immersive feature in games. At the very least, asking such questions may lead us to define different kinds of "immersion."  As Weiss's protagonist remarks:</p>

<blockquote>. . . graphic minimalism goes hand-in-hand with the absorptive, World Unto itself quality that makes these games special, and indeed, a measure of this quality extends to all the Classic games, however basic in conception. When we play these games, the sketchy visual detail forces us to fill in the blanks, and in so doing we bind ourselves to the game world.  Even more, we participate in its creation, we are a linchpin, a cocreator, crucial to the existence of the game world as it is meant to be experienced. Without our participation the Classic game is nothing, it devolves into exactly what the gloss-junky detractors see . .  (66)</blockquote>

<p>We need not follow Weiss's hero all the way down the novel's metaphysical rabbit hole in order to gain some practical insight from his argument about graphic minimalism and immersion. It seems right to us that those classic video games are engaging and immersive for counter-intuitive reasons, precisely because they are schematic and iconic, because they require a collaborative act of imagination on the part of the player, and because playing them (even on today's PC emulators) is about being part of a shared arcade-based culture. 
This seems to us significantly different from the kind of immersion created by cinematic realism in games. And indeed, as we have found in our own experiments in the Romantic Circles WebMOO environment (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040903094252/http://www.rc.umd.edu:7000/">http://www.rc.umd.edu:7000/</a>), Weiss's kind of graphic minimalism is immersive less because it is universal than because it is minimaland cognitively this forces us to maintain gameplay in a wider contextual setting. It's not just retro fashion that gives these games their continued appeal; and it's not that we are in touch with elemental forms when we play PacMan or encounter the MOO interface; it's that we are called on to make something of what is only sketchily suggested, and optimally we do so in a setting that is outside the frame of the screen, that widens to encompass the cabinet, the arcade (even if these features are only fictive constructs in today's emulation play), and other players. In this way any arcade is a social, RPG space. The RPG gameplay situation--like the social setting and the dice and text descriptions of Dungeons and Dragons, or like the theatrical setting occasion of a dramatic scriptcalls on us to perform the immersion. The gameplay's the thing. And gameplay of this kind isor wants to besocial. The minimalist games were in the 70s and early 80s part of that greater complexity, the social and subcultural theatre of the arcade, row upon row of games flashing side by side, people playing alone or (often) in groups and moving among consoles and concessions, interacting within and across the various games. 
</p>
<p>This is the context in which we wish to theorize the MOO as a space for educational and interpretive gaming. First, we find the MOO to be a usefully primitive technology by today's standards. For us, its very limitations make the MOO an attractive platforma way to avoid the "cinematic fallacy" and frame the gameplay in an open social setting. MOO gaming is, like its cousins the networked massively multiplayer persistent-world RPGs, but more like an old-school arcade, a social space containing an ever-changing array of games to play, worlds to enter, moves to perform. The setting, the lighting and decorated game cabinets, is like the image and text furniture of MOO rooms in the MOO and in the Network as a whole. Like the arcade, the cognitive space of interpretive gameplay is at its best when it's packed with other players. Through a detailed discussion of two MOO games in the Romantic Circles WebMOO, MOOzymandias  and FrankenMOO, and with reference to such theorists of immersion and gaming as Ryan, Manovich, Aarseth, Murray, Heim, and McGann and Drucker, our paper will stage its argument for the minimalist, social, and arcade-like WebMOO as a key environment for literary gaming.

<h3>Paper 2 Living Inside the Poem: MOOs &amp; Blake's Milton
<br>
<i>Ron Broglio</i>
<br>
</h3>
<p>



Every new media work can be located somewhere along an axis whose poles are archival at one end and performative at the other.  Academic production online weights heavily at the archival end of the continuum. There is, however, the other side of the axis which is hauntingly underused in scholarship.  Arguably, new media's unique contribution to the humanities is its performative nature.  The reason why the performative side of the web has seen little academic use is simply because we have yet to think of most literary and cultural texts as performative.  The performative nature of the web calls us to re-evaluate familiar texts on new ground.  So, I pose the question, how can we use the performativity of new media in humanities scholarship? The goal of this paper is to better define immersive textuality. </p>
<p>

In his poetry, William Blake has already thought through the problem of producing immersive environments.  His characters are continually creating windows and doors into new worlds or falling through space and time in such a way that the fall creates both space and time.  Through their immersive interaction with one another and their surroundings, Blake's characters forge the world upon which the narrative is staged.  In like manner, Blake wants the reader to immerse him/herself in the poem such that "doors of perception" open for the reader, creating new worlds and new possibilities. Blake asks that his readers move facilely between the folds of the illuminated plates and the world in which they read his prophecies.  The fold between the physical self and textual self at work in Blake's book medium can be highlighted in MOOs by capitalizing upon the difference between typing person and player character. </p>
<p>

The Georgia Tech design team selected Blake's poem Milton as its object of study. The poem is concerned with the problem of possession and poetic inspiration which fits nicely with the team's interest in creating an immersive textuality.  The goal in immersive textuality is similar to that of McGann's quantum poetics: to create a field of play that omits an outside objective space for contemplation.  In the MiltonMOO thought should take place as action within the game space.  Normally the reader occupies a double positionone inside the poem through the act of reading and a second position outside the poem in the "real world" beyond the book.  However, Blake's poem problematizes the second position and collapses it into the first.  He does so throughout the poem Milton most commonly by placing "real" British place names such as Lambeth or London next to fictional names such as Beaulah and Golgonooza.  Real people such as Milton and Blake find themselves alongside Palambron and Rintrah.  Real life objects such as hammers and looms take on epic proportions as the creative Hammer of Los and the Wheels of Enitharmon. </p>
<p>

The MiltonMOO realizes these same folds between reality and fiction. Through a series of inspirations and possessions, the player loses his or her identity and the player's name (object.name) changes to that of a character in the poem.  At each character change, the point of view, the surrounding,  and the  MOO spaces open or closed as options for the player.  Several special features  and technical innovations of MiltonMOO aid in the goal of immersive textuality.  Event aware rooms help establish different character points of view and allow the MOO to keep track of where the player is and has been in the various space/time realms of Blake's poem.  Use of the _html serves different players different visual objects based on their reactions to events.  Furthermore, Flash game pop-up screens change the action in the MOO rooms' _html and the events for the player characters.</p>
<p>

Successfully negotiating a room opens up new spaces to advance the narrative and game play.  In any moment the players are aware that there are many other fields and levels not visible to them and that having traveled through other spaces once, they will never be served and described in the same way again.  In constructing an immersive textual experience, the goal is to create a feeling of being situated within deep spatial folds and a particular temporal moment.  If such immersion is successful, a player feels that each action is a performance and event structure that in the typing and textually performing affects the very architecture of the poemwhat is encountered and where the narrative might leadas well as the meaning of the poem for that player. As a first step toward immersive textuality, the game play of MiltonMOO actualizes folds both for the player inside the game space and for his vegetative self that is typing.

<h3>Paper 3 Programming Interpretation; Playing with Texts with the Ivanhoe and Rebecca Games</h3>


<blockquote>"Although it stops short of approving the sheer fabrication of additional text, the notion that non-authorial readings are 'equally valid as aesthetic activities' expresses a nostalgic desire for the pre-Romantic freedom to choose ...." (Alford, "Improving the Text", English Romanticism: Preludes and Postludes, p. 19)</blockquote>


<p>Textual games like the Ivanhoe Game developed by Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann encourage the fabrication of text as a form of discovery. Such games that allow players to recreate a culture of textual editing, authoring, and adaptation deliberately raise questions about authority, criticism, and history. Following McGann from "Texts in N-Dimensions and Interpretation in a New Key", such games challenge the habit of separation between the object of interpretation and the interpreter, between the stable text and the critic. In Ivanhoe play the text is not stable; it is distorted by the moves of players as they perform roles like editor, critic, or madman.</p>
<p>

But what is the place of the algorithm in the performance of textuality? What of the automatic fabrication that happens when we run programs on texts? In the Ivanhoe game the programming is a medium through which the players can interact with the each other and the text field. While you can play the game without a computer, a networked environment provides a gathering space for the play, facilitating the moves, and providing visualizations of the text field. The game engine, if you will, has a message of its own - it announces that this is a networked computer game and thereby authorizes play. In the Rebecca game, the topic of this paper, the only moves that can be made are programs that process some component of the text field. Thus the emphasis of the game is shifted from editorial or creative moves to algorithmic fabrication. Rebecca is therefore a character in the Ivanhoe game that privileges a particular type of move, though the spirit of the game is different as a result. Rebecca ends up being a site for the display of textual programming brilliance rather than wit, erudition, criticism and bibliographic play.</p>
<p>

The Rebecca game grew out of conversations that we had as part of the team working on the Ivanhoe game. Ivanhoe could include algorithmic moves, though current implementations make the harder. It also has its roots in the game Core War (often called Core Wars) described by A. K. Dewdney in columns for Scientific American in the 1980s. (For HTML versions of those articles see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040903094252/http://www.koth.org/info/akdewdney/index.html">http://www.koth.org/info/akdewdney/index.html</a>.) Core War is a game where programmers create assembly language programs that play each other in battle until only one process is left running. (For more see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040903094252/http://www.koth.org/">http://www.KOTH.org</a>.)</p>
<p>

Rebecca, unlike Core War, is a collaborative game where programs are written to process text with an agreed upon goal in mind. Rebecca, like the character from Scott's novel, doesn't battle, she cures through the application of science and technology. The game starts with a Start.Text and a Goal. The goal could be to change all gendered words in the text or to answer an interpretative question about the text. Each player makes moves by writing a program that processes the Start.Text (or the Output.Text of a previous move) and outputs an OutPut.Text. Players can only make moves on the OutPut.Texts of the moves of other players. The programs written are themselves entered into the record and can be treated as text for moves, though we are not yet sure what that would yield. At any point a player can propose for a vote that the result of a move has met the goal and that the game is therefore over.</p>
<p>

Rebecca is itself a move in an ongoing exploration of humanities computing games and algorithmic interpretation. It proposes a practice where programming can be done in community and be assessed both according to preset interpretative goals and by peers during the game. The game is a form of peer-review. First, the players have to assess if a trajectory of moves can be said to meet the goal. Second, every player, when they chose to work with the output of another player is, in effect, affirming that the previous move helped toward the final goal. The end result is an inverted tree of moves in which one trajectory proved successful - the moves that contributed to that path constitute the successful evolution of code for the goal.</p>
<p>

To return the Alford quotation above, what type of activity does Rebecca validate? What desires does Rebecca hold? While it is early in the game, Rebecca has been designed with the following community goals:
<ol>
<li>
The development of a community of text programmers that collaborate in a fashion that advances our understanding of how computing can assist interpretation. Can we leverage a willingness to play, compete and show off to advance the field?
</li>
<li>The development of reference models for solving hermeneutical problems through programming. Properly documented games should become accessible sources for projects with similar problems. For this reason the code and discussion of a game should be open and accessible. Can we leverage the creative programmers desire for recognition for their work by documenting it in play?
</li>
<li>The development of a practice that encourages and rewards excellence in programming in the humanities. As such, Rebecca as a practice, presents an alternative to peer-review in the form of playful exhibition towards an end. Can we imagine exhibition of programming skill as an alternative to other types of exhibition for review?</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>
To conclude, in this presentation the authors will do the following:
<ol>
<li>
Briefly demonstrate the game play of the Ivanhoe game as played with the James' story, "The Turn of the Screw".
</li>
<li>Discuss the rules of the Rebecca game as played by the authors in its first iteration and show a summary of the moves and their results.
</li>
<li>Discuss the potential for algorithmic games for collaborative development in the humanities.</li>
</ol>
