<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Markup is based on mnemonics (i.e. element names, attribute names and 
attribute values). These mnemonics have meaning, being this one of the most 
interesting features of markup. Markup allows us to define the structure of a 
text in a way that can be both processed by computer programs and understood 
by humans. Human understanding of this meaning is lost when the encoder 
doesn't have a good command of the language the mnemonics are based on. For 
example, a Spanish encoder that doesn't know English will find it difficult 
and error prone to apply or understand TEI markup using the original TEI 
mnemonics based on the English language.</p>


<p>So, by multilingual markup we mean applying marks using mnemonics in one's 
own language but still following the rules of the original markup vocabulary. 
In our own experience, a markup vocabulary exactly equivalent to TEI can be 
developed based on Spanish, Catalan, French and almost any other language, 
and the tools for translation back and forth to the original TEI core can be 
built automatically and can be applied in a transparent and easy way. When we 
build markup vocabularies equivalent to TEI but in the local language, the 
structural facilities and constraints of the markup scheme remain the same, 
only the markup terms used by DTDs, Schemas or documents are different, and 
the document structure becomes remarkably clearer for the encoder.</p>


<p>In this paper we will show and defend the benefits of using multilingual 
markup vocabularies for large digitization projects, like reduced learning 
times, reduction of errors, and incremented production, all due to using 
markup tags in the local language. We will also describe our implementation 
of multilingual markup based on the automatic generation of translating 
scripts using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) for both 
document instances and also DTDs or Schemas. We will also discuss other 
alternative implementations to the one proposed that look promising. Finally, 
we will present the conclusions of the implementation and use of this 
technology within the Miguel de Cervantes Digital Library.</p>


<p>We will also comment on the creation of a TEI Multilingual Markup Special 
Interest Group (TEI-MM-SIG) and the involvement of the TEI META Workgroup in 
the development and full implementation of a multilingual term-bank for the 
TEI.</p>



<h3>Markup, meaning and multilinguality.</h3>


<p>One of the key aspects of structural markup is the meaning it conveys, 
which depends on our ability to understand it.</p>


<p>In 1998 Robin Cover wrote: <i>How does XML help with the encoding of 
information at the semantic level? ... New users sometimes refer to XML as 
semantic markup, and may be heard to praise XML for its ability to express 
semantic clarity through markup. ... Someone who uses a text editor to 
examine an XML document ... will readily judge the XML document more 
meaningful with respect to the information objects represented by text. The 
markup itself is a form of 'metadata', explaining to us what the constituent 
elements are (by name), and how these information objects are structured into 
larger coherent units.</i><a href="#en"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</p>


<p>Sperberg-McQueen et.al. <a href="#en"><sup>[2]</sup></a> supported the 
usefulness of markup as a source of meaning: <i>The function of markup is 
not random. Markup has meaning. ... Why worry about this question?: For 
better markup language documentation, for better QA (verification), for 
better automated processes (translation, normalization, query), to provide a 
way to survey current practice (relevance for software developers) ... and 
because it's interesting.</i> <i>Because markup means something, ... we 
know certain things. I.e. because we see certain markup, we are allowed 
(licensed) to make certain inferences</i>. and concluded that: <i>the 
meaning of markup is the set of inferences it licenses.</i>
</p>


<p>So understanding XML tags is key to correctly delimit complex text 
structures for further automated processing. This understanding may be 
compromised when tag names (elements, attributes and attribute values) are in 
a foreign language.</p>


<p>The largest group of workers in our digital library is by far the 
proof-reading and markup team, comprised of about 40 persons. They are 
graduates from different humanities fields, none of them related to the 
English language. It is in this area where the necessity and importance of 
translating the original English markup into the local language (Spanish) is 
made evident.</p>


<p>We learned from practice that using a tagset in a foreign language, 
compared to using a tagset in our own language, increases the learning time 
and reduces the quality and amount of digital text production, since tag 
names are mnemonics that may sound familiar to English speakers but are hard 
to understand and memorize by users of other languages. Giving our encoders 
the possibility of applying tags in Spanish has increased the amount and 
quality of digital text production.</p>


<p>After successfully using XML-TEI for sometime, we embarked in the project 
of translating TEI element names, attribute names and attribute values to 
Spanish. Then we developed the translation tools to grant automatic 
conversion to and from the main TEI English core. These automatic conversion 
programs translate not only the markup of XML documents but also the 
corresponding DTDs.</p>


<p>Then we repeated the experience with Catalan and we did some tests with 
French. Now we are in the process of building other TEI tagsets and 
translations for several other languages. The purpose is to have many 
official translations of the TEI tagset, but one core version (the original 
one). The automation of the language translation of the tags is vital to 
assure easy interchangeability of documents amongst projects using different 
languages. In this way, and from the structural and semantic point of view, 
the tagset is the same, only the names change.</p>


<p>We also believe that having multilingual versions of a given tagset, like 
TEI, can facilitate its acceptance and use in many parts of the world like 
Latin America where the use of XML for electronic publishing is still 
uncommon. This may be of special interest for digital libraries and digital 
publishers worldwide, but specially within the European Union where 
multilingual projects can benefit in a remarkable way.</p>



<h3>Automatic generation of markup translators</h3>


<p>We started by defining the set of possible translations of element names, 
attribute names, and attribute values to the different target languages. We 
stored this information in an XML multilingual translation mapping document. 
An example of this document and its DTD follows:</p>

<p>This mapping document which contains all the necessary structural 
information to develop the language converters is read by the transformations 
generator, which was built as an XSLT script <a href="#en"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. XSL can be used to process XML documents in 
order to produce other XML documents or a plain text document. As XSL 
stylesheets are XML, they can be generated as an XSL output. In this way, and 
for each of the languages contained in the multilingual translation mapping 
file, we produced both an English to local language XSL transformation and a 
local language to English XSL transformation. In this way we assured both 
ways convertibility for XML documents.</p>


<p>For each target language we also generate a DTD or a Schema translator. In 
our first attempts, this took the form of a C++ and Lex parser (see figure 1). Then we changed the 
approach, and now we first convert the DTD to a W3C Schema, then translate 
the Schema to the local language, and finally we generate an equivalent 
translated DTD (see figure 2). 
This approach has the advantage of not using complex parsers (only XSLT) and 
also solves the translation of Schemas, which is an interesting goal in 
itself  (see figure 3).</p> 


<p> We only considered a one way translation from the English DTD/Schema to 
a local language DTD/Schema, since we assumed that the DTD/Schema would be 
first built in the original language (English) and then translated to the 
local language. We saw no need to translate the local language DTD/Schema 
back to English (dashed line), but this is a transformation that could easily 
be generated if the need arises, allowing for maintenance and modifications 
to be done in the local language and then translated to English. </p>
 

<p>Many other markup translators can be built to other languages in the same 
way, as shown by our tests with Catalan and French.</p>

<h3>Usage and implementation alternatives</h3>


<p>We think that markup in the local-language should only be used for tasks 
which require human intervention, like creation and maintenance of documents. 
For automated processing and document interchange we think it is more 
convenient to use markup in the language of the original standard. In this 
way, processing tools like stylesheets need not be translated to the local 
language, but the document translated to the original tagset instead.</p>


<p>An alternative, and perhaps the most effective implementation of 
multilingual markup could be a translating interface integrated into an XML 
editor. In this way, we would have virtual views of the document with markup 
in different languages that could be toggled at the touch of a button, but 
without actually having to translate the document file. An implementation 
like this is possible today, but can only be done by the software companies 
who build XML editors. This built-in solution would not require the 
DTD/Schema to be translated. An editor like this would need to load the 
mapping information (tag-map), as well as the DTD and the document instance 
(see figure 4).</p>


<p>A compromise solution that can be integrated into some XML editors by 
expert users is to build macros that automatically apply the translation to 
local language on opening the document, and the translation back to English 
on closing. This would not be as handy as a one-key language-toggling 
solution, but can be implemented by users. Additional macro programming would 
also be required for translation before validation and before applying 
further processing like XSLT.</p>


<p>If multilingual markup becomes a common practice, the mapping structure 
with the name equivalences for markup translation could well be included as 
part of a new form of Schema. In any case, this use should be specified and 
formally integrated into the XML family of standards.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>

<ul>


<li>Are the advantages of using a general and widespread markup vocabulary 
like TEI lost?: Not at all. The two main advantages of using a general markup 
vocabulary like TEI are <b>document interchangeability</b> and <b>community 
support</b> (which includes training and tool sharing). Since markup terms 
can be very easily and automatically translated to the original TEI tagset, 
interchangeability is not lost and tools like XSLT scripts can still be used 
unchanged after markup translation. Training materials, however, may need to 
be translated or adapted, but this is not due to the use of multilingual 
markup but to the need of non-English-speaking encoders to have documentation 
in their language.</li>


<li>In our experience, learning times were noticeably reduced.</li>


<li>Production times were also reduced, along with an increase in markup 
quality. Encoders showed themselves satisfied and more confident in their 
task.</li>


<li>By using markup in one's own language, the meaning of markup is not lost, 
and the document structure suddenly becomes more clear.</li>


<li>Scholars and students showed approval for being able to handle documents 
with markup in the same language of the text.</li>


<li>Cooperative multilingual projects may benefit from the possibility of 
easily translating the markup to each encoder's language.</li>


<li>Sometimes new non-standard vocabularies are developed just because it 
seams comparatively easier than learning a standard vocabulary in a foreign 
language. Having the possibility of using a standard vocabulary in one's own 
language plays against developing a new custom vocabulary to fulfil a local 
markup requirement. This may help spread the use of XML vocabularies like TEI 
or DocBook in non-English speaking countries.</li>


<li>Spreading the use of standard markup vocabularies is good for document 
interchangeability.</li>


</ul>
</p>



<h3>Future work</h3>


<p>A special interest group on multilingual markup (TEI-MM-SIG) has been
created within the TEI Consortium to exploit and expand the benefits of using
multilingual markup. During its first meeting at the 2003 TEI annual meting, 
the idea, tools and possibilities of multilingual markup have been 
introduced, and the objectives of the group have been established. Some of 
them are:

<ol>


<li>Translate all TEI mnemonics into different languages. This should be done 
by TEI users from different language zones, with interest in using markup in 
their own language. This is one of the main reasons to become a member of 
this SIG.</li>


<li>Using the different sets of mnemonics, we should build an official 
repository of TEI terms, i.e. a multilingual TEI Term-Bank. The TEI META 
Workgroup will provide technical support for implementing this Term-Bank.</li>


<li>Betatest the new term-sets and tools. This is another reason to join this 
group: to be the first to use this technology and provide feedback to improve 
it.</li>


<li>Study the technical possibilities, limitations and challenges of 
multilingual markup. There are many aspects to be discussed and decisions yet 
to be made. To give an example, there may be problems to overcome if we want 
to build mnemonics using accented or oriental characters.</li>
