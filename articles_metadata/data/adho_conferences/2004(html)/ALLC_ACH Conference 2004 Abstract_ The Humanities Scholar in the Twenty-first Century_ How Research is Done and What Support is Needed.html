<p>Libraries have long been perceived as the laboratory  the workspace 
     for the humanities scholar (Aboyade), providing access to a wealth of materials 
    that are subsequently analyzed, critiqued and interpreted. Recent advances 
    in technologies from computing to networking are redefining the humanities 
    scholars workspace. Today novel techniques and innovative methodologies are 
    providing new opportunities for cutting-edge humanities scholarship. How has 
    computing changed humanities scholarship? What do humanities scholars need 
    to pursue their research?</p>
  
<p>Under the aegis of the Text Analysis Portal for Research (TAPoR) project 
    (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040903094455/http://www.tapor.ca/">http://www.tapor.ca/</a>), we are undertaking a Web-based survey to better understand 
    the current needs of humanists. Rather than assume what all the needs of our 
    community might be, we have sought the input of our colleagues (this survey builds
	on an earlier interview-based one with a small group of participants; see Fisher). In addition 
    to helping us to formulate a vision for the development of the TAPoR portal, 
    we believe that such as study is very likely to provide valuable insights 
    of general interest into the current state of computer-based humanities scholarship, 
    as well as provide crucial justification for pursuing grants to respond to 
    specific issues.</p>
  
<p>The survey was made available on November 10th and 
    will be accessible until December 15th. It contains three 
    sections: a) profile of the demographic and research profile, b) use of computing 
    in teaching, and c) use of e-text and text analysis tools. While all participants 
    completed the first part, only those who teach a course in the humanities 
    completed part B and only those who use e-text and/or text analysis tools 
    complete part C.</p>
  
<p>As of November 15th, ninety-six scholars (half male and half female) 
    from more than a dozen countries had responded to the survey. Three quarters 
    were under the age of 45 and most were long term and frequent users of computers 
    and the Web. These respondents came from a range of disciplines working in 
    a range of genre (mostly prose) and primarily using textual material for their 
    research (it should be noted that the survey was especially directed at text-based
    humanities scholars; this focus is something that subsequent surveys may wish
    to broaden). </p>

  
<p>Over 80% use e-text and about half use text analysis tools. In general 
    they believe that e-text are available for their use and expect to find them 
    downloadable off the Web. They prefer to find them in a stable, legal form 
    that is freely available from a reliable institution. In terms of mark-up, 
    respondents appear to be a bipolar group with half expecting to acquire text 
    with no mark-up and half with rich XML. </p>
  
<p>In general, respondents believe that they need text analysis tools, 
    although not complex tools, and are not happy with the tools that are currently 
    available. Somewhat surprisingly, over 50% did not know about commonly available 
    tools such as TACT, WordCruncher and Concordancer. The one most highly used 
    was TACT but few found it useful. In addition to our list of about ten tools, 
    participants added another two dozen tools that they employ in their work. 
    These included tools such as the Wordsmith Tools as well as common Microsoft 
    Office products such as Word and Access. </p>
  
<p>We inquired about their collaboration and communication habits. Most 
    use e-mail regularly and subscribe to listservs. But they tend to work as 
    solitary scholars, rarely collaborating with their own graduate students and 
    do not see the need for collaborating with other scholars. That said, they 
    like to communicate with other scholars at various points in the research 
    process. They share some of their materials, but tend not to share notes and 
    tools, although they expect others to share tools.</p>
  
<p>From our data we are developing a picture of the humanities scholar, 
    how they do their research, including the text, tools and techniques they 
    use; the type of collaboration and communication they practise; and their 
    use secondary and primary resources. Our work will also involve a second phase 
    that involves interviews with a select number of humanities scholars. In the 
    final version of our paper, we will combine survey results with the interviews 
    for a rich picture of the humanities scholar in the twenty-first century.</p>
  
<p>Acknowledgments: the authors wish to thank University of Toronto Masters 
    students, Natasha Flora and Imran Hasan who created the survey, and the University 
    of Toronto for providing a small internal SSHRC grant to support the work. 
    Many thanks are due as well to our colleagues who were willing to participate 
    in the survey.</p>
