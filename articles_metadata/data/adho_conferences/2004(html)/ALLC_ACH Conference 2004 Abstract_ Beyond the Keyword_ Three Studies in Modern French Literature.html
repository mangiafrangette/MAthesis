This session proposal is unified both by subject and by methodology. French literature between the 18th century and the present constitutes the data on which the studies reported have been carried out.

</p>
<p>This basic unity of subject is reinforced by strong methodological innovation. 

</p>
<p>            Each paper in its own way goes beyond the simple retrieval of keywords, by now a routine activity in computer-literature study, to extend the scope of analysis to areas of interest more closely approximating what is usually done by scholars of literature. P. Fortiers paper examines the methodological implications of wanting to study complex human phenomena like aging or senile dementia in the ARTFL database, something that cannot be accomplished simply by a keyword retrieval procedure. D. Laporte points out that limiting computer analysis of literature to texts by a single author, as the growing number of author-focussed databases encourages the researcher to do, overlooks the crucial inter-textual dimension of all literature. M. Olsen examines the oft-debated question of whether there is a discourse particular to women authors, pointing out the insufficiency of facile answers, and bringing both advanced linguistic theory and sophisticated computational techniques to bear on the question.

</p>
<p>Note on the Language of Presentation: D. Laporte would prefer to give his paper in French. M. Olsen would prefer to give his in English. P. Fortier sees the advantages and disadvantages of each. The French option makes a statement about the international character of the associations. The English option assures the largest number of people in the audience and able to follow what is presented. We would be willing to be guided by the Programme Committees advice in this matter.

<h3>Human Aging in the Tr&eacute;sor de la Langue Fran&ccedil;aise

<br>
<i>Paul A. Fortier, University of Manitoba</i>
<br>
</h3>
<p>

            In one of the many satyrical passages of his novel La Naus&eacute;e, Jean-Paul Sartre has his narrator describe the historians craft: Dans notre partie, nous navons affaire qu&agrave; des sentiments entiers sur lesquels on met des noms g&eacute;n&eacute;riques comme Ambition, Int&eacute;r&ecirc;t [In our area, we deal only with uncomplicated feelings on which we stick generic names like Ambition, Interest my translation] (Sartre, 1938, p. 8). This same temptation to over-simplify can be identified in computer-aided studies of literature. We deal in the statistics of spelled forms: after all, grouping words, particularly in a language like French, under their dictionary forms would cause a lot of extra work, and we can always claim that any upgrading introduces human error. This paper describes progress in a large-scale project which accepts the possibility of human coding error to deal with semantically and morphologically complex sets of words designating phenomena of interest, in spite of the added complexity at the computing and data processing level.

</p>

<h4>Data</h4>
<p>
A series of projects being carried out at the University of Manitoba is examining how human aging, Alzheimer disease and other forms of senile dementia are portrayed in writings produced in France between 1789 and the 1950s. The choice of France is suggested by the fact that from the 17th century until the present day, France has been the European country with the largest proportion of old people in the population. The period covered begins with the Revolution of 1789 which removed from France the last vestiges of feudal privilege and began the transformation into a modern liberal industrial state, and ends with the 1950s when the introduction of the common use of antibiotics extended life expectancy quite sharply, thus changing the biological reality underlying the concepts of old and aging.

</p>
<p>           Study of this period is facilitated by the existence of the Tr&eacute;sor de la Langue Fran&ccedil;aise database. This database was set up by a committee of scholars originally to reflect elite usage of the French language to facilitate the preparation of a new dictionary of modern French. A concerted effort was made to include important writings of all types, and to distribute the texts chosen in an homogenous fashion over the period in question. All in all, 1079 texts were included in the database, divided into 388 works of non-fiction prose, 379 novels, 183 plays and 129 collections of poetry. Almost 74 million words of text are contained in the database, making it one of the largest coherent corpora  as distinguished from a collection of texts  available to researchers to-day (see Imbs, 1971, vol. 1, preface). It can reasonably be taken to be a reflection of thinking by those who had their hands on the levers of power in France between 1789 and the 1950s.

</p>
<p>            Approximately 110,000 potential allusions to aging are found in the database. After one has removed occurrences of the vocabulary of aging applied to concepts and things, approximately 60,000 allusions to human aging can be found. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that towards the middle of the 19th century the outlook on aging shifted from positive to negative (Fortier et al. 1997). Further analysis is ongoing but faces a paradox: once potential allusions to human aging have been converted by human intervention into authentic allusions to human aging, statistical analysis is precluded by the fact that the data are now no longer comparable from one text to the next.

</p>

<h4>Method</h4>
<p>
The approximately 64 words potentially evoking aging can be searched in the ARTFL database using 41 search strings submitted to the philologic software. The software returns each word in approximately 300 characters of context. These results have been downloaded and converted to wordprocessor format for all the texts in the original ARTFL database. These downloaded word-processor versions of the potential vocabulary of aging have now all been disambiguated by research assistants, a very time-consuming but not particularly interesting process.</p>

</center>




<h4>Results</h4>
<p>
Results have now been cross-checked and verified for the first 345 texts, covering all genres in the period 1789-1859. In this period, the texts recorded total 26,600,008 words. Individual texts range from 643,636 words to 1,159 words in size. Within this twenty-six million words, 34,055 are part of the vocabulary of aging, and the number of words concerning aging varies between 1406 and 0 in any given text. The vocabulary of human aging occurs 14,552 times in these texts, varying between 963 and 0 in individual texts.

</p>
<p>            Since the size of the texts varies so widely, it makes sense to normalize the results in terms of a base of 100,000 words. That is to say the raw frequencies for each text are divided by the number of words in the text, and then multiplied by 100,000 so that the number of words in the text not have an overwhelming influence on the results. When the set of normalized frequencies is sorted into descending order of relative frequency of the potential vocabulary of aging in each text, and the frequencies of the potential vocabulary of aging are plotted along with the number of allusions to human aging in each text, the appropriateness of the approach used becomes evident (see Figure 1). Although the top line (potential human aging) is relatively smooth, the bottom line (authentic allusions to human aging) is quiet jagged, showing that although one frequency is necessarily a subset of the other, there is quite a bit of variation in the proportion of words that evoke human aging from one text to the next.

</p>

<h4>Further Analysis</h4>
<p>
Once one has identified all the common words evoking human aging in a given text, the task is not entirely finished. Once a person, whether identified by a proper noun like M. Dupont, or by a common noun like father, has been clearly labelled as old in a text, every time that person is alluded to in the text becomes an allusion to aging. My assistants are currently upgrading texts that have been checked and verified, by adding these allusions to the vocabulary of human aging on a text by text basis. Such modifications will further differentiate texts in terms of number of allusions to human aging, but will facilitate providing a more accurate image of how aging was presented in the period being studied.

</p>
<p>            The database of extended allusions to human aging will be used as input to a process of identifying allusions to senile dementia in the Tr&eacute;sor de la langue fran&ccedil;aise database, for senile dementia must be found where the vocabulary of human aging and the vocabulary of dementia co-occur.

<h3>
Making Space: Women's Writing in France, 1750-1900 

<br>
<i>Mark Olsen, ARTFL Project, University of Chicago</i>
<br>
</h3>
<p>

It is well documented that men and women use informal language, such as conversation and correspondence, in rather different ways, reflecting a wide variety of cultural forces and practices.<a href="#en"><sup>1</sup></a> Until recently, however, there have been relatively few attempts to examine gender differences in more formal, published writing.<a href="#en"><sup>2</sup></a> Last year I presented to this conference some preliminary results from a computer-assisted analysis of two moderate sized samples of literary works by French male and female authors published primarily between the 18th to 20th centuries.<a href="#en"><sup>3</sup></a> 


</p>
<p>Very clear distinctions were found between male and female literary writing, most notably in the selection of words used in the two samples, as reflected in use of marked differences in the rates of us of both pronouns and possessives (function words) and less frequent content words. Women's writing of the period may be generally characterized by a more personal, interactive, and involved style and is considerably more descriptive of internal and emotional states than male writing of the same period and genres. The lexical collocations -- a rough measure of the meanings of words or sets of words -- of a small set of selected words did not vary significantly, suggesting that the meaning of words, were not significantly altered by gender of writer in spite of different rates of use of these words. Finally, comparing the representation of women between male and female authors by looking at the rates of "possession" and other frequent adjectives, which may have been expected, did not result in significant differences by gender of author. 

</p>
<p>By implication, I suggested that the selection of words, reflecting the selection and treatment of topics, is not an unconscious effort. Women's writings of this period established a space in which women could write, in ways identifiably distinct from male authors, but within prevailing linguistic norms or, more specifically, using words with the same senses and associations as male authors. I drew this implication based on a relatively small number of comparisons. The range of function and content words that have a strong gender bias is very significant. It is most neatly summed up by the interesting example of body and soul. The female writers use &acirc;me 1.62 times as frequently as men, but use corps -- which signifies the physical body and a "political body" -- only half as often as male writers. Global comparisons and comparisons controlled for genre and time period all reveal gender preferences for different vocabularies which is all the more notable due to the observation that the words preferred by male authors are more likely used at high rates by female authors than the reverse. 

</p>
<p>Using an enhanced sample4 of works by French women, this paper examines in a more systematic nature male and female use of words that strongly correlated with one gender or the other. This is based on the identification of classes of terms with strong gender preference, such as the female preference for terms describing emotive, internal or subjective states which include 

affection, calme, chagrin, confiance, courage, douceur, douleur, d&eacute;sir, envie, estime, esp&egrave;re, espoir, esp&eacute;rance, joie, imagination, larmes, passion, pense, peur, plaisir, plaire, plaisir, respect, r&ecirc;ve, savoir (and verb forms), sensible, sentiment.*, sentir, solitude, souffrir, souvenir, s&eacute;rieux, tendresse, trist, tristesse, vain, &acirc;me, and &eacute;motion. 

</p>
<p>Comparisons of the collocations of these sets of terms in the samples of male and female will be the first test to see if gender of author modifies the use of gender selected vocabulary. It is not clear, however, that lexical collocation is sufficiently fine grained to detect gender differences since it is designed to isolate more general patterns of meaning. 

</p>
<p>Indeed, evaluation of individual agency in a text or communicative act may be a necessary corrective to the rather mechanistic model proposed by statistical approaches such as word counts and lexical collocation. The second part of this paper will isolate sentences containing a set of gender biased vocabulary, in works by male and female authors, to examine in more detail the discursive structures in which these are used. While the concordance and textbase are powerful tools to find and extract passages with particular sets of terms, a second order formalism would appear to be required in order to provide a more systematic analytical model. This part of the study will rely on elements of the theory of Functional Grammar proposed by Simon Dik6 to identify a set of relationships between the selected terms and the semantic, syntactic and pragmatic functions within the clause and/or sentence in which they appear. The features to be identified and tagged largely without computer intervention include 
the position of the term in the clause (first words are more important); 
the syntactic function of the term; 
in the case of so-called relational nouns, the identity (gender) of the (implied) referent: author/reader/third party; 
and if the term appears as the Topic or Focus of the clause, binding it to larger rhetorical structures. 

</p>
<p>In the following sentence from Sand's Indiana containing the word courage, 

</p>
<p>Cette lettre, Raymon n'eut pas le courage de la lire jusqu'au bout. 

</p>
<p>we see the identity of the referent and subject is a male (Raymon), that courage is a direct object; it does not appear in a clause-initial position and it is neither the Topic or Focus of the sentence. Identification of a small set of functional features in a select set gender biased words will shed considerable light on the degree to which male and female authors used these words in similar or different ways. 

</p>
<p>Use of formalisms such as functional grammars to provide additional interpretive or analytical guidance on results extracted from large datasets by more traditional full text searches may be another way to help "summarize" or digest the very large number of "hits" that can be generated by the current generation of full text search and analysis engines. Automatic filtering and counting of result sets by even the simpliest of criteria, such as the position of a word in a clause, may be a fruitful way to bridge the gap between computation as quantification and computation as a method to more handling more abstract levels of meaning and linguistic function. 

</p>
<p>Differing patterns of word use between male and female writers in France in the past several centuries suggests that women writers were consciously making a public space for their voices, by selecting and treating themes in markedly distinct ways. It is less certain whether they modified the meanings of the words they used or simply used the words in the same way as male writers. This is an important distinction as it bears upon the degree to which language is gendered, reflecting prevailing power relations, and mechanisms by which gender marking in language is both preserved and overturned.

<h3>Balzacs reinterpretation of the Gothic topos of the debauched convent

<br>
<i>Dominique Laporte, University of Manitoba</i>
<br>
</h3>
<p>

            Studies of Balzacs La Com&eacute;die humaine have benefitted from electronic editions which, without replacing Castexs (1976-81) Pl&eacute;iade Edition, change textual analyses of this author. The possibility of using the CD-ROM by Nicole Mozet and Isabelle Tournier Balzac: explorer la Com&eacute;die humaine or the electronic index by Kazou Kiriou Le vocabulaire de Balzac available at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040903094242/http://www.paris.fr/musees/balzac/">http://www.paris.fr/musees/balzac/</a> facilitate systematic study of keywords in a way that excludes manual reference to the twelve volumes of La Com&eacute;die humaine in the Pl&eacute;iade Edition. This electronic access to the texts raises methodological questions. The pagination of an electronic edition is problematical if it does not correspond to standard reference texts, but this is a minor problem compared to others which go to the heart of electronic-based studies of Balzac, particularly those that place too much stress on keywords in a brief context. Such an approach deals too much with micro-texts abstracted from the complete context of the text which gives them their full meaning. This problem can be resolved by a consultation of the full texts carried out as an integral part of the analysis process.

</p>
<p>            A more serious methodological problem, which Balzac studies are beginning to identify (Bordas, 1997; Herschberg-Pierrot, 1998), is that whether it be computer-based or artisanal a study that does not go beyond La Com&eacute;die humaine is necessarily cut off from the intertextual dimension of the text. The text is certainly rich enough to give rise to literary studies of a structuralist or even post-structuralist or deconstructionist nature. But any type of study which limits itself to the repetition of keywords in La Com&eacute;die humaine risks passing over the essential in Balzac, as with any other author, that is to say the originality of the writing or the style which was defined by Buffon as a reflection of the personality of the writer. The risk is to replace style by less significant aspects like stereotypes, clich&eacute;s, and topo&iuml;, which the authors use in his novels of the 1840s of techniques drawn from melodramatic and popular texts (Duchet &amp; Tournier, 1993) makes particularly problematical. From this perspective, the use of databases like those available from the ARTFL Project or Gallica (Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France), in which La Com&eacute;die humaine does not appear in isolation but in company with other texts, goes beyond a tight focus on the individual texts to place the writing in the context of the body of literature which provides the cultural environment in which it can be fully understood.

</p>
<p>            The comparative method fostered by such resources puts the stress on the general in contradistinction to what is uniquely Balzacs (Genette, 1982, p. 85). Electronic comparison of La Com&eacute;die humaine with other texts shows, in Balzacs writings, a rich intertextual dimension to the extent that La Com&eacute;die humaine consists of implicit repetitions or indirect quotations of other writings with a dialogic (Bordas, 1997), parodic or ironic (Bordas, 2003) effect. Contemporary criticism is moving away from the concept of a unique Balzac whose texts have a single level of meaning: the readable Balzac of Barthes (1970). It is, therefore, appropriate to analyse electronically identified passages from Balzac not only in relation to other writings by this author but in its full context which includes the writings of other authors.

</p>
<p>            These methodological principles justify close examination of an example of intertextuality which has given rise to literary influence studies in the literary history tradition, without rigorous stylistic or lexicographical dimensions, that is to say the relation of La Com&eacute;die humaine to French translations of British Gothic (18th century) novels. This examination deals not just with the modification undergone by topo&iuml; common to La Com&eacute;die humaine and to other texts. It also reveals the transformations to which Balzac subjected them, in contrast to their relatively unchanged use in French gothic novels and melodramas of the same period (see Bernard-Griffiths &amp; Sgard, 2000). Until the present, Balzac critics have looked at this topic mainly in the authors early novels (1822-25), which are either pastiches of the gothic novel or parodies of its conventions. This question is being examined by means of comparisons of topo&iuml; characteristic of the gothic novel found in Balzacs later novels. The transformations undergone by these topo&iuml;, as discussed above, provide the clearest material for understanding the functioning of this aspect of La Com&eacute;die humaine.

</p>
<p>            The availability of existing computer databases facilitates a systematic evaluation of the synchronic relationships between La Com&eacute;die humaine and contemporary texts, as well as a diachronic approach to the evolution of these topoi withing La Com&eacute;die humaine. This will be illustrated in the communication with particular reference to the topos of the convent as a prison and site of debauchery, which, in spite of being widespread in the gothic novel (cf. La Religieuse, Justine ou les malheurs de la vertu, Le Moine, LItalien ou le confessional des p&eacute;nitents noirs) and in the melodrama has not, or not yet, given rise to detailed study in the context of Balzac.
