<p>How are the humanities engaging gaming and game culture? How can we study
games? </p>

<p>While computer games and interactive spaces have been used in Humanities
Computing to teach and conduct research, humanities computing can also draw on
disciplinary traditions to study computer games. As computer games become a
legitimate field of study we should ask how we can engage games and game
culture from the perspective of the traditions of humanities computing. </p>

<p>In this session we will present three trajectories or examples of humanities
computing research into games. The first discusses the importance of playing
and adapting games as part of research and graduate instruction. The second
looks at an important part of game culture, modding or the modification of game
systems. The third paper presents a philosophical approach to interactivity in
games drawn from both computing literature and theories of dialogue. </p>

<p>The study of computer games has emerged in a number of silos from education
research to a popular literature around classic games. The terrain of computer
game research is still being negotiated, but the following is a brief review of
some of the areas from which research into computer games is emerging. 
<ol>

<li>After the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton and the Tabor,
Alberta copy-cat killings there has been a explosion of interest in computer
games and violence. The academic literature coming from psychologists and
sociologists on the subject of the pejorative effects of computer games
predates the horrific events in Littleton (there is almost always someone who
warns us about new media) but these events have brought the literature press
attention. We can call this a sociological or psychological literature
interested in the social and psychological effects of games, not their
rhetorical effects. An example would be Dill, Karen and Jody Dill, "Video Game
Violence: A Review of the Empirical Literature." Aggression and Violent
Behavior , Vol. 3, No. 4, pp. 407-428, 1998. </li>

<li>There is a literature around educational games coming from educational
theorists and the instructional technology community. By contrast, while the
first silo is critical of the effects of games, most of the educational
literature is aimed at exploiting the motivating character of games for
educational ends. Instructional technology research tends to breathlessly
report on the possibilities for educational games rather than carefully assess
the outcomes of expensive projects. An example of this would be, Rieber, Lloyd,
"Seriously Considering Play", Educational Technology Research &amp; Development
44.2 (1996): 43-58. A preprint of this is available at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040813205058/http://it.coe.uga.edu/~lrieber/play.html">http://it.coe.uga.edu/~lrieber/play.html</a> , accessed March, 2002.
</li>

<li>There is a popular literature about the history of computer games,
personalities in the industry, and companies like Atari. An example of this
sort is Zap!: the Rise and Fall of Atari though a recent work, Supercade, wins
the prize for the best illustrations. Associated with this literature is the
business press about the computer game business. Business sources seem
perpetually surprised to report the money being made on games which sell to a
comparatively narrow bandwidth of the population. See Cohen, Scott, Zap!: The
Rise and Fall of Atari, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984 or V. Burnham, Supercade; A
visual history of the videogame age 1971 &ndash; 1984, Cambridge, MA: MIT
Press, 2001. </li>

<li>There are a number of computer game related WWW sites and popular magazines
aimed at the consumers of these games. </li>

<li>Perhaps the most interesting source, if you believe we should listen to
practitioners, is the literature written by game designers and the computer
game press about how to design a computer game. This ranges from the more
reflective works like Chris Crawford's The Art of Computer Game Design to
"how-to-in-24-hours" books of dubious value except to dummies. Because such
works are aimed at game developers they almost always have a chapter on
game-play or interaction. What is important about this literature is that
describes interactivity from the perspective of the game designer and thus
provides a window into the discourse of those that create the interactive. See
Crawford, Chris, The Art of Computer Game Design . This out of print book is
available in PDF form at Crawford's site http://www.erasmatazz.com/. At this
site you will also find a Library of other materials by Crawford on game design
and interactivity. </li>

<li>There is a philosophical literature around play and sport of which the best
known example is perhaps Huizinga's Homo Ludens (Boston: Beacon Press, 1950),
though there is also a sub-field of philosophy emerging around the philosophy
of sport that deals with play in sport and the nature of the game. </li>

<li>Finally there is, of course, the literature around hypertext, hypermedia,
and new media of which Lev Manovich's The Language of New Media is one of the
most recent, and best interventions. This literature generally deals with
issues of interactivity either in the limited sense of the hypertext link
(surely there is more to interactivity than linking), or deals with
interactivity as a feature of the interface. Other works of note are Aarseth's,
Cybertext; Perspectives on Ergotic Literature, and Janet Murray's, Hamlet on
the Holodeck. </li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>The traditions of humanities computing overlap with most of these fields
because humanities computing has been interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary.
One important component to humanities computing research has been the
development and use of technologies as part of research. Thus computing
humanists overlap with game designers in their interest in theory that has
application and can be applied. Computing humanists also draw heavily on the
literature around hypertext which in turn has drawn heavily on media theory and
literary theory. </p>

<p>We present these three papers as examples of how computing humanists can
engage with games and their culture. </p>



<h3>
Winter Nights in Alberta: Computer Role Playing Games and Digital
Narrative in the Classroom
<br>
<i>Sean Gouglas, St&eacute;fan Sinclair</i>
<br>

</h3>

<p>This paper discusses the use of computer role-playing games in the
instruction of hypermedia narratives in a graduate-level multimedia course in
Humanities Computing at the University of Alberta. The construction of digital
narratives, through dynamic web authoring, Flash, or game module creation, for
example, has provided professors, students, and creative writers with an
opportunity to explore the narrative potential of a hypertext environment. From
a creative writing standpoint, Carolin Guertin&rsquo;s <i>Assemblage</i>
project and Sue Thomas&rsquo;s <i>trAce</i> online writing centre have
provided significant resources for those exploring writing in a digital space.
Janet Murray has, of course, provided students with significant opportunities
over the years to explore new media writing, which she outlined in <i>Hamlet on
the Holodeck</i>. Much of the efforts in this area have struggled with the
increasing potential for interactivity afforded by evolving electronic mediums
(many of which are examined by Espen Aarseth in his <i>Cybertext: Perspective
on Ergodic Literature</i>). Each technological change, whether it be simply
increased computing power or a revolutionary new technical interface, provides
additional opportunities for increasing the interactive nature of digital
narrative. </p>

<p>These narratives rarely change the options presented to the reader. Though
the reader&rsquo;s choices will alter the path of the narrative, rarely is
there a systematic method for altering the path of the story based upon the
reader&rsquo;s physical and psychological characteristics. Computer role
playing games attempt to introduce this level of complexity. In
Bioware&rsquo;s <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> (NWN), for example, the
player&rsquo;s avatar (or character) is endowed with a variety of
characteristics that follow the character generation rules of an updated
version of <i>Dungeon &amp; Dragons</i>, one of the first tabletop Role Playing
Games (RPG). As each avatar may possess significantly different abilities in
strength or intelligence, or fundamentally different life skills, such as
healing or fighting, the options presented to the character and therefore the
player can be quite dramatic. For example, even if the person playing the game
knows the answer to a riddle, the avatar may not be given the option to select
this answer from a dialogue tree if the character&rsquo;s intelligence score
is not sufficiently high. </p>

<p>While the game itself offers an interesting diversion, the real strength of
NWN stems from the constructor kit, which allows individuals to create their
own immersive three-dimensional world, including an interactive plot, sound and
special effect triggers, dialogue trees, and a powerful scripting language. The
construction of these interactive narratives is enhanced by the playing. The
reader enters a world where options and opportunities change by choices and
their subsequent consequences. The ability to change camera angles and
zoomed-distance to the action, an &ldquo;historic event&rdquo; according to
Lev Manovich, allow for no correct &lsquo;point of view&rsquo;, resulting in
a narrative experience can never be exactly repeated. </p>

<p>Although the course is principally a theoretical exploration of
communication and new media studies, the construction of this computer gaming
world is the third of three technical assignments that focus on the manner in
which the medium changes narrative possibilities. The first two, an unedited
ten-minute tracking shot (in the spirit of Hitchcock&rsquo;s Rope) and a Flash
presentation, provide significantly different challenges to students,
principally stemming from the changing levels of interaction between the
storyteller and the audience. The NWN assignment prompts students to consider
the wide-ranging impact of interactivity on their attempts to construct a
narrative. This paper, which outlines the initial successes and failures of
this process, offers some insights into the challenges of introducing computer
gaming into a graduate curriculum &ndash; a challenge generally accepted
willingly by the students, but with some hesitation by teaching peers. </p>



<h3>
Playing with Cultural Exchange: Digital Games and Player-Created
Content
<br>
<i>Andrew Mactavish</i>
<br>

</h3>

<p>It is commonly claimed that, with the evolution of personal computing comes
increased opportunities for participation within cultural production and
distribution (Barlow 1996; Bolter 1991; Jenkins 2002b; Landow 1997; Rheingold
1993). In the 1980s, new technologies of desktop publishing (layout software
and laser printers) worked their way into the homes of computer-savvy
entrepreneurs so that a new home-based industry of document design flourished,
albeit one that sometimes confused access with talent. In the 1990s, the
emergence of the World Wide Web and graphical browsers opened up a new,
inexpensive and efficient means of distribution. Anyone with a computer, an
Internet connection, and knowledge of HTML could become not only a writer and
designer of documents, but also a publisher. In the years straddling the turn
of the millennium, new and inexpensive multimedia technologies are enabling
users to create visually and orally rich documents and environments using
digital video, high resolution audio, and sophisticated animation. In addition,
new technologies and practices of distribution continue to emerge that, much to
the vexation of many copyright owners, allow consumers to distribute music,
images, texts, video, and software applications over peer-to-peer networks such
as Napster, BitTorrent, and KaZaA. </p>

<p>In this paper, I focus on a set of emerging user-creative practices that
continue the general trend towards increased access to the means of cultural
production and distribution that we have been seeing in popular applications of
digital media technologies. But rather than na&iuml;vely forecast a digitally
democratic future to come, I investigate how relations between corporate
interest and user-creativity are a site of negotiation and contest over the
rights to produce and distribute cultural goods. </p>

<p>In particular, I look as a set of cultural practices surrounding digital
gaming known collectively as game modding. Short for &ldquo;game
modification,&rdquo; game modding is a catchall term covering the production
of any player-created derivative game content that can be imported into the
original game or that can be played as an entirely new game on top of a
game&rsquo;s underlying architecture or engine. Some examples of game mod
types include new levels or maps, new character skins or avatars, or new sets
of rules imported into games. Importantly, game mods can be distributed and
downloaded freely over the Internet. Frequently, game manufacturers ship games
with the necessary tools for mod creation and actively support mod communities
surrounding their games. In other words, game modding is a form of
player-creative practice that, in being cultivated by developers, immediately
distinguishes it from other user-based distribution practices surrounding
popular media such as music. Yet, while the gaming industry may be developing a
model that supports and encourages consumer participation in the systems of
cultural exchange, the field is certainly not unified, consistent, or
uncontested. There is an ongoing negotiation between developers and players,
and one that is not always collegial as each side works towards defining
legitimate game-production practices. </p>

<p>In my examination of player-creative practices, I focus on the cultural
politics of creating computer game mods. I argue that modding is a form of
player-creative game play that cannot be adequately explained by theories of
cultural production, distribution, and consumption in which consumption is
always already in a position of weakness against production and distribution,
which are always already in positions of power. A theory of digital gaming
culture must account for player-creative game play as encompassing a range of
contradictory creative practices, some of which are simultaneously empowering
and disempowering, resistant and submissive. As a contribution towards such a
theory, I examine game modding and its communities to demonstrate the emergence
of conflicting models of production, distribution and consumption. For
instance, by providing mod tools to their customers, game developers increase
sales, help to generate a committed and long-term community following, and
potentially train newly employable game developers. At the same time, however,
they also provide the means for mod creators to challenge the very models of
production and distribution&mdash;including the rules of intellectual
property&mdash;that maintain relations between consumers and producers in
which cultural works are commodified for capital profit. In other words, the
mod community/industry is a space of conflicting modes of cultural production
that, if theorized within a framework that accounts for its contradictions, can
also help to explain other forms of digitally-mediated participatory culture.

<h3>
Playing with Interactivity: Dialogue as Interactivity
<br>
<i>Geoffrey Rockwell</i>
<br>

</h3>

<p>It is common to describe computer games as interactive, but do we know
really what interactivity is? This talk will develop a theory of interactivity
based on dialogue as a paradigm for interactivity, a paradigm that has been
developed in the literature around computing since Alan Turing proposed a
variation of the dialogical imitation game. The paper will contrast the way
human computer dialogue is presented in computing literature to theories of
dialogue developed within philosophical traditions. The paper will conclude
with a theory of interactivity adapted to criticsm of computer games.
Interactivity, in this theory, is between objects in the game and on the
screen. Iteractivity is between the representation of the player in the virtual
game and other entities like monsters. </p>

<p>This paper will do the following. First, trace the discourse around
interactivity in computing from &ldquo;Computing Machinery and
Intelligence&rdquo; by Alan Turing to Chris Crawford's &ldquo;The Art of
Computer Game Design&rdquo; and more recently &ldquo;The Art of Interactive
Design.&rdquo; Particular attention will be paid to a short dialogue on
interactivity in Stewart Brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Media Lab&rdquo; where he
and his interlocutor develop a definition of interactivity. </p>

<p>Second, review selected theories of dialogue developed in philosophical
traditions. The written dialogue has been an important form of philosophical
literature from Plato to Heidegger. At certain periods the dialogue has
flourished as a genre of philosophical writing and in response philosophers
have speculated as to its generic capabilities. In particular the paper will
deal with Plato&rsquo;s discussion of the place of poetry in the just state in
the &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;. This discussion anticipates a common critique of
computer games &ndash; that they train participants to behave in unsavory
ways. This critique will be followed into Italian Renaissance theories of
dialogue, especially that of Sperone Speroni who presents a counter argument in
support of comedic participation that anticipates Bakhtin&rsquo;s dialogical
discussion of the novel. The paper will contrast these two approaches in
philosophy to works which represent disreputable acts and characters, as many
computer games do. </p>

<p>Thirdly the paper will present a theory of interactivity drawn from theories
of dialogue. So, what does this understanding of dialogue offer us as a way of
reacting to interactivity? The first point, which will seem counterintuitive,
is that interactivity is not between the user and the computer. Instead
interactivity is something we eavesdrop on. Interactivity is between the
characters on the screen that we watch. We can control one or more of those
characters, but the interactivity is between agents of the same order - namely
the components/characters on the screen and, just as in dialogue we listen in
from outside, even when we are participants, so in interactive multimedia we
stand outside from our avatars controlling them and watching how they interact
with the world. A game like The Sims by Electronic Arts nicely illustrates
this. </p>


<h4>
Dialogue and Interactivity
</h4>

<p>If we apply observations about dialogue to interactivity we come to the
startling conclusion that interactivity is designed to be watched, that the
point of interactivity is not necessarily the mutual reaction of the human to
the computer, but is instead the scripted interaction presented on the screen
between objects and characters within the game as controlled by us and the
computer. </p>

<p>That is not to say that the player is a passive witness. Rather, there is a
double involvement of the player. On the one hand they control a character or
some other more primitive presence on the screen. That control is a matter of
HCI (human computer interaction) or ergonomics (as far as the physical controls
are concerned) and Interface (as far as the representation of the player in the
virtual world is concerned.) Interactivity, then is that which happens between
your avatar and the virtual world populated by virtual objects and characters.
</p>

 

<h4>
Advantages and Disadvantages to this Theory
</h4>

<p>This way of speaking about interactivity as separate from ergonomics, HCI,
and interface design has the virtual virtue that it is closer to the language
of immersion around games. I don't say that I interacted with a computer where
I saw my avatar interact with a blood-dripping deamon from outer space. I say I
killed the deamon (and it sprayed blood all over me.) The interaction is that
which takes place between the programmed entities within the game. I forget
myself in the flow of the game and act as if I were that character on screen. I
forget the controls and the interface and, for a moment, play my role. This is,
of course, what Plato warned us about. </p>

<p>This perspective on interactivity has other advantages. It reflects the way
game design happens in the world of consoles and personal computers. The game
designers rarely control the physical interface, they can only control the
objects that appear and how they interact with each other. Further, it allows
us to focus on the essential contribution of game designers (as opposed to the
graphic designers that work on games) - the development of the game engine.
These game engines are like the rules that cover board games; they define what
the objects and characters are and how they can interact in what sort of world.
The player controls one or more characters and the others are controlled by an
AI. The developers of the game engines program the interactivity between the
objects they define which allows this definition of interactivity to focus on
the programming of interactivity as the concrete work of the game designer.
</p>

<p>This framework also gives us a handle on how to critique a computer game,
especially the highly interactive ones that are hard to discuss using hypertext
theory or narrative theory. 
<ol>

<li>We can ask about the world in which the interaction takes place. What is
the setting or the stage of the dialogue. </li>

<li>We can ask about the other interlocutors or characters out character meets
in the game. What type of people inhabit the game world and how do they react
to out player? </li>

<li>We can ask about the hero - the player's character that you control. </li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>Finally, to return to advantages of this theory, it makes room for the
humanities to engage an area that can be dominated by technical and engineering
issues. This is why we need to negotiate and bracket the field of HCI and
Interface design when discussing interactivity and games. The humanities asks
how things work rhetorically, and this theory is designed itself to fit
interactivity not in a tradition of human computer interface, but in a
rhetorical tradition that includes dialogue as a pattern for structuring
representation. If humanities computing is going to contribute to the
discussion we have to make clear what we bring to the table and how computer
games are not just advanced computing interfaces, but also communicative works,
artistic works, and rhetorical works worthy of treatment in a tradition of
playful artifacts. </p>
