<h3>Introduction</h3>
  
<p>
  In this
  paper we describe the production model and dissemination models of a
  newsletters service. We will first describe the context
  of the problem, one of the biggest Web-based digital libraries of Spanish
  works, and the spirit and objectives of its interactive
  and dissemination services. Amongst these, the newsletters service is an
  information dissemination service that provides useful information to readers.
  We will talk about the production model of the newsletters based on XML-TEI (2) and
  XSLT, and about the personalizable dissemination model we are now implementing.
  The dissemination model
  combines adaptive with adaptable personalization techniques, being capable of
  ranking news according to navigation-inferred preferences and then filter them
  according to a user-given profile.
  </p>
  


<h3>Communication services of the digital library</h3>

  
  
<p>
  One
  of the goals of the MCDL is to act as a communication channel for the academic
  community. In this sense we have implemented a number of communication
  services, and we try to maintain a permanent communication with our readers.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  Electronic publishing makes it possible to reach every
  corner of the world and opens up new research and communication paths. The
  Miguel de Cervantes Digital
  Librarys Web based news-service comprises five different digital library
  newsletters, and one monthly journal all managed and produced using XML-TEI 
  and XSLT technology. News and articles may appear in different newsletters
  and/or the journal, and they also have different periodicity (some are
  published quarterly and some monthly). The news and articles come from
  different sources, which generally coincide with departments or units of our
  digital library. A general editor reviews the articles or news, decides where
  they must appear, and also manages the distribution lists.
  </p>
  


<h3>A simple solution for production</h3>

  
  
<p>
  Each of the five different newsletters anf the journal are delivered in
  several optional output formats, and all managed and produced based on XML-TEI
  and XSLT technology (see 
  figure 1).
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  First, we considered the possibility of developing a management system
  based on a database. Then, while reviewing the requirements, we realized that a
  much simpler solution using an XML editor, XML-TEI encoding and XSLT
  transformations was possible.
  </p>

<p>
  A database based system would be better for editing and maintenance of
  news, but news have no maintenance. Once the are published, there is no more
  editing of the news. However, they can be searched, but this service can be
  provided by an XML searcher without the need of an DBMS (database management
  system).
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  With this simple solution, no system programming was needed, only the
  XSLT transforms needed to be built. In addition, it takes advantage of the same
  TEI XML markup scheme and the same processing technology we use to produce our
  digital books. The differences are mainly the overlapping of news and the
  interrelated times of publication.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  We used XSL-TEI to markup each piece of news. In the case of the
  newsletters and the journal we use a subset of the tagset we currently use for
  books, so we developed a small DTD for this purpose.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  We had to
  develop several XSL transformation scripts to produce the different output
  formats required. Newsletters are generated both in plain text (for traditional
  mail readers) and in HTML for those who prefer a richer format.
  </p>
  


<h3>How it works</h3>

  
  
<p>
  Once the monthly news file is complete and supervised, we enter the
  automatic phase of generation of different output formats. The final output in
  HTML format is obtained from a double transformation
  of the XML-TEI file (see figure 3). First an XSL transformation processes
  the XML monthly file to generate a single HTML file (with special formatting
  marks embedded). Then a parsing program of our own design called MakeBook
  transforms that file into a digital book, generating a file for the table of
  contents, and a file for each section of the journal. Notes are extracted from
  the main file and placed in small external files, leaving hyperlinks to these
  files in their place. MakeBook was also thought to add page headers and footers
  for each section, that include buttons to implement a navigation pattern called
  "indexed guided tour" [2]. This navigation pattern allows both the presence of
  a central index or table of contents and also buttons to move back and forth
  the different sections of the journal (hence the metaphor guided tour).
  Buttons to jump up and down article headings with a mouse click are also
  provided. The result is an electronic journal that is nothing but a set of web
  pages interconnected with a ring-star topology: a bidirectional ring of
  connections to navigate the sections, plus a central table-of-contents page
  with bidirectional connections to each section (see figure 2).
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  A set of
  templates is used for formatting and providing navigation functionality to the
  generated HTML files. The purpose of using templates is to give a uniform
  appearance to all the monthly journals, as well as to facilitate the
  maintenance, so that format changes can be applied easily and evenly to the
  whole set (e.g., section headers and footers, background colors and textures
  and navigation buttons can be changed through these templates).

<h3>The proposed solution for dissemination</h3>

  
  
<p>
  The Web Engineering Group of the department
  of Computer Languages and Information Systems at the University of Alicante has
  developed a method, OOH [1], and an accompanying software tool (VisualWADE) to
  assist the design of language-independent Web Applications. This software,
  based on standards for information systems object-oriented analysis and design
  like UML, OCL and XML, supplies an environment for modelling personalized and
  device-independent user interfaces. In this project, VisualWADE was used to
  model the navigation and personalization aspects of the application.
  </p>
  


<h3>Personalization: ranking and filtering of news</h3>

  
  
<p>
  The user
  model we have implemented for newsletters automatically and transparently
  incorporates information gathered from user navigation (adaptive part). In
  addition, the user can set-up some filtering restrictions and customization
  preferences when registering for this service (adaptable part). The final model
  is based both on implicit interests on certain digital library sections
  (information gathered during navigation) and on explicit preferences compose
  the user profile.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  News are
  classified by category and subject-matter. Categories are: new publications
  (new digital resources), future publications, new sections, chat announcements,
  call for papers, suggestions from our departments, letters from readers, visits
  of important people, contests, and the remainder are classified as general
  news. Subjects or matters are derived from the actual thematic structure of the
  DL. Each theme section or subcollection generates a subject-matter, as for
  instance: Latin-American literature, humanities research, history, children's
  literature, theatre, interactive services of the DL, computers and humanities,
  critical studies, tribute to hispanists, Argentine Academy of Letters, PhD
  theses, movies, magazines/journals, recently printed books, law, and many more.
  This allows for a very fine granularity.
  </p>
  


<h3>An algorithm for ranking news preferences</h3>
  
  
<p>
  Every time
  the user clicks on an entry of the newsletter table of contents (see figure 4),
  the Web page jumps to a single piece of news, and the server increments in one
  the corresponding category and subject-matter counters. Only one category but
  multiple subjects can be assigned to a piece of news. Relative access
  frequencies can be computed for categories and for subjects. Then news can be
  given a ranking value for a given user for a given news-reading session, which
  is calculated as the sum of subject frequencies of the subjects corresponding
  to a given piece of news, multiplied by the frequency of its category. For
  instance, if a user has an access frequency of 0.3 for the new-publications
  category, and, 0.1 for the history and 0.2 for the PhD-theses subjects,
  then a piece of news announcing the publication of a PhD thesis on history will
  weight (0.1 + 0.2) 0.3 = 0.09, and will
  be ranked accordingly.
  </p>
  


<h3>A profile for filtering news</h3>
  
  
<p>
  On
  registration, the users can specify Boolean constraints for categories and
  subjects, saying which ones should to be sorted out and which should be
  displayed. This profile can be modified by the user.
  </p>
  


<h3>Personalization at work</h3>

  
  
<p>
  Newsletters
  are accessed through a monthly index, where news are ordered first by category
  and then by subject, according to the dynamically computed ranking. But not all
  the ranked news appear, they are filtered according to the user explicit
  profile. The first 
  <b>
   N
  </b>(3) ranked entries that pass the filter are shown openly, and the rest appear as a
  collapsed "more news" button.

<h3>OO-HMethod Overview</h3>

  
  
<p>
  Personalization
  properties are captured at navigation/presentation level and are reflected in
  their corresponding conceptual models by means of a set of association rules.
  The design and generation of the navigation logic is specified in two parts: a
  stable part, independent from the personalization properties, and a variable
  part, that supports the treatment of these rules. Finally, a rules engine
  provides the context to interpret the generated rules at execution time. (see figure 5).

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
  
  
<p>
  This
  solution to the production of newsletters and a journal for a digital library
  saves an important amount of time: now we can produce the newsletters and the
  journal in less time and with less effort than what was previously required to
  produce only the newsletters by hand. The output formats are uniform and
  regular, and less error prone. Previous newsletters showed les uniformity and
  some rendering errors. Compared to the other production models of our digital
  library (for digital text books and for digital facsimiles books), this model

  The general
  newsletter, which is the most demanded one, currently has 14,000 subscribers
  worldwide.

<p>
  Concerning
  the dissemination model for these newsletters, we have enhanced the granularity
  by offering more detailed personalization options, which allow us to rank the
  news based on preferences gathered from user navigation (observation model).
  The design of this solution was performed according to the OO-H Model and using
  the VisualWADE tool. This technology can significantly
  increase the productivity at the time of developing Web applications.

  The MCDL,
  with this effort, struggles to fulfill its objective of spreading research
  knowledge to the global academic community through the Web. Our aim is to be
  able to offer a better service by optimizing searches of digital resources, by
  reducing waiting times for digital publication, by promoting dynamic scientific
  research communication and by developing efficient preservation strategies.
  Daily experience results in the continuous integration of new ideas. Our goal
  is not only the mere publication of research work, but to build a rich and open
  communication channel for the global scientific community. The newsletter
  service described here plays a key role in this communication channel.

&lt;p&gt;-Hemos publicado la edici&amp;oacute;n multimedia del gui&amp;oacute;n de "La Corte de
Fara&amp;oacute;n" (1985), de Rafael Azcona y Jos&amp;eacute; Luis
Garc&amp;iacute;a S&amp;aacute;nchez. Se trata de una pel&amp;iacute;cula clave
para acercarse desde una perspectiva humor&amp;iacute;stica al
fen&amp;oacute;meno de la censura teatral durante el franquismo. Puede
encontrarse, adem&amp;aacute;s, una serie de materiales diversos sobre este
divertido film y la opereta hom&amp;oacute;nima, con los que es posible conocer
algunos de sus detalles m&amp;aacute;s relevantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
