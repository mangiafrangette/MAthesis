<p>This paper is based in large part on the thoughts, work,
          and efforts of the members of the TEI Character Encoding
          work group who met in Nancy, France in November 2003:<ul>
            
<li>Michael Beddow</li>
            
<li>David Birnbaum</li>
            
<li>Patrick Durusau</li>
            
<li>Christian Wittern (chair)</li>
          
</ul> Members of the work-group who were not present at
          this meeting have contributed greatly to the group's efforts
          overall, but less substantially on this particular issue:
          <ul>
            
<li>Deb Anderson</li>
            
<li>Lou Burnard</li>
            
<li>Espen Ore</li>
          
</ul>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
          
<p>The TEI
            Character Encoding work-group recently considered the issue
            of language identification in TEI XML documents. This
            paper is a presentation of our deliberations and
            conclusions along with extensions thereto from the authors
            imagination. Thus the work-group members can only be held
            responsible for the conclusion described here; the author
            is responsible for any logical fallacies or other errors
            presented.</p>
        
        
          
<h4>Background</h4>
          
<p>In July of 1990 the Text
            Encoding Initiative released the first public draft of
            their proposed Guidelines For the Encoding and
              Interchange of Machine-Readable Texts, commonly
            known as <tt>TEI P1</tt>. These guidelines, and the
            SGML DTD that accompanied them as an appendix, included a
            provision for an attribute, <tt>lang</tt>, which was
            available for use on every element in the entire TEI
            scheme.</p>
          
<p>This attribute has survived, in pretty much the same
            form, through the first non-draft release of the
            Guidelines (TEI P3) to the most recently released version
            (P4:2002-07), although in that version there is an
            explicit admission that the mechanism employed by the TEI
            <tt>lang</tt> attribute is likely to undergo
            significant revision at the next release.</p>
          
<p>In November of 1996 the
            W3C
            released the first public draft of their proposed
            Extensible Markup Language, commonly known
            as XML. This working draft had no provision for language
            identification. By the time the specification became an
            official W3C recomendation (February of 1998), however, it
            included a provision for an attribute,
            <tt>xml:lang</tt>, which (if declared appropriately
            for valid documents) could be used on any element in an
            XML document.</p>
          
<p>These two attributes serve the same major purpose: to
            indicate the (natural) language an element is written in.
            However, they have different mechanisms for acheiving this
            purpose, and slightly different semantics. Thus, users of
            TEI P4 XML have a potentially confusing choice as to which
            method to use.</p>
          
<p>It is perfectly acceptable to use both simultaneously, of
            course. However this has the obvious disadvantages of
            extra work, verbosity, and redundancy which serves not as
            a fallback if there is a problem, but rather as a source
            of trouble if the two are in disagreement.</p>

<h4>Pros and Cons</h4>
          
<ul>
            Advantages of TEI <tt>lang</tt>
            
<li>
<b>name freedom</b>: Because the value of
                lang is a reference to an arbitrary
                identifier, the user is free to choose any token
                (subject to the limitations of an XML
                namehttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-Name) 
                she wishes. Note that nothing prevents the user from
                using the very same names she would have used if she
                had the same restrictions as those on
                xml:lang.</li>
            
<li>
<b>descriptiveness</b>: The user can
                describe the language being discussed as thoroughly as
                she likes in prose. From within her description she is
                welcome to refer to ISO 639, IANA, SIL Ethnologue, or
                any other standardized list of languages.</li>
            
<li>
<b>extensibility</b>: The system permits an
                easy but formal mapping between languages in the
                document and any language, even those
                that do not appear in the standard authority lists.
                This means that the indicated language can be
                described very precisely. For instance, one might well have
                different lang identifiers for each of
                the various dialects of southern American English in
                an Mark Twain novel.</li>
            
<li>
<b>well-defined</b>: The semantics of
                lang are reasonably well defined.</li>
            
<li>
<b>familiarity</b>: TEI users have used
                lang for years.</li>
            
<li>
<b>brevity</b>: it's short.</li>
          
</ul>
          
<p>This does not mean that there are no disadvantages to the
            TEI scheme, of course. The most obvious, more because it
            is an intractable problem than because of any TEI
            shortsightedness, is the inability to formally describe a
            language. But there are others. Suggestions have been put forth,
            e.g., to permit the specification of the correspondence to
            multiple authority lists; to permit a hierarchical
            indication of sublanguages; and to permit the value of
            <tt>lang</tt> to point to an external
            langUsage.</p>
          
<p>However, it is reasonable to assume that if TEI were to
            continue using <tt>lang</tt>, at least some of these
            concerns would be addressed in P5.</p>
          
<ul>
            Disadvantages of TEI <tt>lang</tt>
            
<li>Little software support, and not much prospect for
              improved software support in the future.</li>
          
</ul>
          
<ul>
            Advantages of XML <tt>xml:lang</tt>
            
<li>Somewhat better software support, and very good
              prospects for improved support in the future.</li>
          
</ul>
          
<ul>
            Disadvantages of XML <tt>xml:lang</tt>
            
<li>
<b>scope</b>: This is the major complaint
                against xml:lang: that it applies to
                attribute values as well as element content. This
                concern will be discussed in more detail in the full
                paper, taking each attribute type into

<li>
<b>no pointing</b>: There is no formal
                semantic for what the value of xml:lang
                is, except that it is a language identifier. It is not
                possible to point directly into the authority list
                being used, or to point at any further classifications
                or descriptions of the language being identified.</li>
            
<li>
<b>poor extensibility</b>: While it is
                entirely possible for a user to develop an identifier
                for a particular sublanguage or dialect for which no
                ISO or IANA identifier exists, there is no mechanism
                to associate any information about the language so
                identified with the identifier.</li>

<h4>Results and Reasoning</h4>
          
<p>Despite the obvious disadvantages of
            <tt>xml:lang</tt>, the TEI Character Encoding
            work-group chose to recommend that in P5 the TEI drop the
            <tt>lang</tt> attribute and declare
            <tt>xml:lang</tt> instead. Why use the inferior
            approach? First it is important to realize that for TEI
            P5, the scoping problem (which is the most significant
            disadvantage of <tt>xml:lang</tt> is drastically
            minimized compared to P4, as it is expected that most
            string type attributes will become elements instead. Thus,
            said elements can bear an <tt>xml:lang</tt>
            attribute of their own, and the scoping problem is
            avoided. Given that the differences would then be minor,
            the work-group applied the principle that unless your
              method is demonstrably significantly better than the
              standard, you should be using the
              standard[4], and thus chose the more widely
            standardized <tt>xml:lang</tt>. The fact that it is
            far better to only have one attribute for this purpose,
            and that the TEI could not likely do much to remove the
            W3C one also influenced our decision.</p>
          
<p>However, in order to make up for the lost functionality
            of a formal association between the identified language
            and a description thereof, at least for non-standard
            languages, a mechanism needed to be developed to link the
            new <tt>xml:lang</tt> to a description
            (language in langUsage in the
            teiHeader). One such mechanism was proposed in
            Nancy, however I anticipate some active discussion on the
            issues, and perhaps some changes in the mechanism, over
            the next two months.</p>
        
        
            
<p>This paper will explore the advantages and
              disadvantages in more detail, with particular attention
              to the scoping problem mentioned above. I will argue
              that in fact the attribution of language to most
              attributes is not only useless but meaningless, and will
              present the new mechanism for linking the language
              identified to its description.</p>
