Bangla is the second most widely spoken language in the Indian subcontinent, yet has not been the focus of much research activity in either corpus linguistics or language engineering to date. This paper describes the automatic processing of pronouns in three and a half million words of Bangla corpus data. A corpus-based analysis of Bangla pronouns is developed, and a new approach to the analysis of Bangla pronouns is taken as a consequence. On the basis of this analysis a system is then developed to identify and analyse Bangla pronouns in corpus data.
