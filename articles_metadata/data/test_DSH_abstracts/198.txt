This article describes the research and development (R&D) work done as an extension to the multilingual cross-domain client application prototype for UNL-ization and NL-ization for natural language processing (NLP) application developed by Agarwal and Kumar (A multilingual cross-domain client application prototype for UNL-ization and NL-ization for NLP applications. Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, 2016)1. A common platform has been developed and made live for worldwide users where they can share their Interactive Analyzer and EUGENE (dEep-to-sUrface GENErator) resources and exploit already shared resources by other users for UNL-ization and NL-ization. This article also highlights that how the existing platform can be used by other researchers and developers to make their UNL-based Web applications language-independent and can make it available to computational linguists, researchers, developers, and general audience globally. Such kind of platform is definitely useful for all UNL-based R&D activities being done throughout the geography. The platform gives 100% accuracy. However, the correctness depends on the F-measure of the respective Analysis and Generation module being used.
