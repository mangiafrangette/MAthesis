Zipfâ€™s law is an important linguistics law. In 1940s, Zipf found power law in the distribution of the word frequencies. The word rankings are in descending order of their occurrence frequencies. Through a series of experiments of random input letter sequences, the results show that the power law distribution has existed in not only natural language utterances but also random symbolic sequences.
