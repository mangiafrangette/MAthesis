Dialectometric techniques for analyzing variation in the aggregate are maturing rapidly, but there is still little agreement on how to extract linguistic structure from aggregate comparison. The present study explores one means of comparing aggregate analyses in order to determine linguistically concise characterizations of restrictions, essentially the use of factor analysis (FA). Using the Southern states data which Guy Lowman collected as part of LAMSAS, we apply FA to the vowels involved in aggregate analyses in order to determine which alternations in pronunciation tend most to co-occur.
