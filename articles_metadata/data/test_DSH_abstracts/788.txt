This paper presents two projects involving Biblical texts. The first one aims to produce a critical edition of the Old Slavic New Testament, the second tries to reconstruct the Diatessaron, a harmony of the Gospels, composed in Rome in the second century and transmitted in a great number of languages. The paper briefly describes how computer collation of Slavic manuscripts can form the basis for a critical edition and how Diatessaronic evidence in different languages can be compiled electronically. Common problems of employing modern technologies in these traditional areas of philological research are discussed and, finally, some advice is offered.
