The Centre for Irish and Celtic Studies at the University of Ulster is currently producing a digital dictionary of medieval Irish (eDIL) based on the standard Dictionary of the Irish Language published by the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. This paper addresses some of the problems encountered in the digitization process, including data capture, processing non-standard characters, modifications to the TEI guidelines, automatic generation of tags, and the establishment of a lexical view while preserving the original format of the paper dictionary.
