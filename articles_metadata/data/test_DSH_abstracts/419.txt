This article presents a statistical comparison of common patterns of regional phonetic and lexical variation in American English based on the results of two previous dialect studies. Because these two studies are based on datasets that represent different cities, this article also introduces a general method for comparing dialect maps that are based on different sets of locations. This method of comparison consists of two steps. First, the dialects maps are defined across a shared set of reference locations through ordinary kriging. Second, these normalized maps are correlated to each other in order to estimate the similarity between the original dialect maps. The results of this comparison show that regional phonetic and lexical variation follow similar patterns in Modern American English.
