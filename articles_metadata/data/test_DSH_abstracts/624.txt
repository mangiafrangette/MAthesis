Existing software for handling textual variants suffers from a number of faults, and is generally designed for a narrow range of text types. This paper develops a new data structure for variants, suitable for a wider range of texts, which also solves most of the problems associated with the representation of variant data. A prototype applet, which can graphically display the new data structure is described, as also the current state of the editor being developed from it.
