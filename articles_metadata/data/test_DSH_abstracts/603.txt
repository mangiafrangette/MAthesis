This article presents a disambiguation method which diminishes the functional combinations of the words of a sentence taking into account the context in which they appear. This process is built in two phases: the first phase is based on the local syntactic structures of the Spanish language and reaches an average yield of 87%. The second one is supported by syntactic tree representation and pushes the results up to an approximate high end of 96%. This process constitutes the starting point towards an automated syntactic analysis.
