Accurate transcription is difficult and time-consuming. It is therefore worth choosing the transcription strategy that will yield the smallest number of errors for a given total effort. We use a mathematical model of the transcription process to compare two basic strategies: a single transcription with repeated checking, and a pair of transcriptions with a smaller amount of checking. Our model for checking is an adequate description of the rate of error detection in a real transcription. We show how to optimize the proportion of effort allocated to checking locations where the two transcriptions disagree, and discuss the factors that favour either of the strategies. We suggest how one might design an optimal transcription strategy in practice.
