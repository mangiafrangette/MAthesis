This essay discusses the methodological problems faced by researchers in the humanities, and more especially so those in literature. Its aim is to advance the field of telematics research of literary texts. As it is, literary research is already in checkmate for its high degree of subjectivity and lack of an approach to ensure the effectiveness of its results as it happens in the so-called Hard Sciences. Therefore, when a literato launches him/herself to do research with the use of text analysis software, he/she has to learn from science how to report his/her search so that his/her peers can reproduce the experiment and come to similar results.
