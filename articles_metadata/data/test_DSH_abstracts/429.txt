This esssay intends to understand the relationships between arts (especially literature) and technologies, in our current environment characterized by intense technological saturation. Anyway, so far, there is nothing substantially new in this contrast we want to establish between arts and technology: the first ones are always based on some techniques (which are mostly internal to arts) and have constantly tensioned relationships with technologies (which are mostly external to arts). And when I say tensioned relationships, it means that I am trying to understand the distances and rapprochements between arts and technology, without having to choose definitely a possibility or another, as it has often been done by artists, aesthetes, critics, and theorists.
