All-words sense tagging is the task of determining the correct senses of all content words in a given text. Many methods utilizing various language resources, such as a machine readable dictionary (MRD), sense tagged corpus, and WordNet, have been proposed for tagging senses to all words rather than a small number of sample words. However, sense tagging methods that require vast resources cannot be used for resource-deficient languages. The conventional sense tagging method for resource-deficient languages, which utilizes only an MRD, suffers from low recall and low precision because it determines senses only when a gloss word in the dictionary exactly matches a context word. In this study, we propose an all-words sense tagging method that is effective for resource-deficient languages in particular. It requires an MRD, which is the essential resource for all-words sense tagging, and a raw corpus, which is easily acquired and freely available. The proposed sense tagging method attempts to find semantically related context words based on the co-occurrence information extracted from the raw corpus and utilizes these words for tagging the senses of the target word. The experimental results of an evaluation of the proposed sense tagging algorithm on a Korean test corpus consisting of approximately 15 million words show that it can tag senses to all contents words automatically with high precision. Furthermore, we also show that a semantic concordancer can be developed based on the automatic sense tagged corpus.
