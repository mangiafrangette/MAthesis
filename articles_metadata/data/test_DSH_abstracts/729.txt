Automatic keyword extraction is an extremely interesting prospect for computational humanists because of its potential as a tool to aid scholarship in the humanities. Keyword discovery routines can help organize large collections of texts and perhaps even guide scholars to the discovery of important elements in their source materials. It is not clear, however, that the methods designed to extract keywords from paper abstracts or newswire texts will be effective for literary texts that are not written in English. This paper describes the modifications required to the traditional tfâ˜…idf keyword discovery algorithm so that it will extract valid keywords from literary texts written in Ancient Greek.
