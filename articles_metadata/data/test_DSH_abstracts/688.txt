Using an adaptation of C. and D. Labb√©'s method of intertextual distances, fourteen short texts by three literary scholars are shown to be distinguishable by author. Of equal interest is the proximity of texts which treat similar themes, or employ similar sub-genres. The interaction of the factors which contribute to intertextual distances enriches the approach and goes some way towards bridging the gap between computational stylistics and traditional literary criticism.
