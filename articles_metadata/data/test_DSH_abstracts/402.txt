This article reports on a study of XML-markup experiences as reading practices of secondary students studying English literature in a public high school in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Since training in the digital humanities (DH) has historically been restricted to those in undergraduate and graduate programs, an important consideration in DH education is how we might implement DH methods in secondary school curricula with a view to introducing prospective scholars to the field prior to their admission to post-secondary education. A concomitant goal would be to investigate a new locus for DH education, at a different level of education and in a different institutional environment, to observe how or if DH might migrate from the locale to which it has acclimatized. Our work maps a method for developing this pedagogy and presents findings on students’ semantic tagging of two short stories: Ernest Hemingway’s (1927) ‘Hills Like White Elephants’ and Sean O’Faolain’s (1948) ‘The Trout’. Analysis of this tagging reveals markup as reading practice and describes how students negotiate between the experiences of reading, how these experiences may be realized by text, and the ways in which XML markup—as process—mediates between.
