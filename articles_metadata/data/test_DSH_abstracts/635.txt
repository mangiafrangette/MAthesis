This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis performed on the forty-seven novels of Anthony Trollope. It is shown that there is a trend in the distribution of chapter lengths for each novel towards a state of increased evenness. Some possible causes of the trend are considered, although the most probable explanation is conjectural.
