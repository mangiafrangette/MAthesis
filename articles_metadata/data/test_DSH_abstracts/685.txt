In Norway, the project Henrik Ibsen’s Writings is currently establishing a new historical–critical edition (both electronically and in print) of the complete writings of playwright Henrik Ibsen. In the years the project has existed, there has been a continuing internal discussion on the relationship between philology and text encoding. This paper outlines the philological principles of the project and describes its methods of establishing texts and ensuring quality. It also looks at and describes, in detail, the consequences of combining philology and text encoding through examples of problems solved in the encoding of complex changes in manuscripts as well as parallel structures in verse dramas. The paper concludes that it is very important, in a project such as Henrik Ibsen’s Writings, to focus on the relationship between philology and text encoding because of the influence, even in the smallest details, of these on each other.
