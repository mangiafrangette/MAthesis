Data mining, statistics, and data analysis are popular techniques to study datasets and extract knowledge from them. In this article, principal component analysis and factor analysis were applied to cluster thirteen different given arrangements about the Suras of the Holy Quran. The results showed that these thirteen arrangements can be categorized in two parts such that the first part includes Blachère, Davood, Grimm, Nöldeke, Bazargan, E’temad-al-Saltane and Muir, and the second part includes Ebn Nadim, Jaber, Ebn Abbas, Hazrat Ali, Khazan, and Al-Azhar.
