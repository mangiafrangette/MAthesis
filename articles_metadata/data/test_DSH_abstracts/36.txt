Cultural data and information on the web are continuously increasing, evolving, and reshaping in the form of big data due to globalization, digitization, and its vast exploration, with common people realizing the importance of ancient values. Therefore, before it becomes unwieldy and too complex to manage, its integration in the form of big data repositories is essential. This article analyzes the complexity of the growing cultural data and presents a Cultural Big Data Repository as an efficient way to store and retrieve cultural big data. The repository is highly scalable and provides integrated high-performance methods for big data analytics in cultural heritage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed repository outperforms in terms of space as well as storage and retrieval time of Cultural Big Data.
