Over the last few decades, there has been tremendous growth in online communication through different types of media. Communication via the Internet is anonymous, which causes a critical issue regarding identity tracing. Authorship identification can apply to tasks such as identifying an anonymous author, detecting plagiarism, or finding a ghostwriter. Previous research has outlined the various methods and their improvements for the identification of anonymous authors based on stylometry. However, changes in the writing style of an author over a long period has not been addressed. In this article, we propose a methodology for author identification where the writing style of an author changes. The proposed methodology consists of two phases: the first will show the change in writing style of the author and in another phase the change is mitigated by a new feature normalization technique. A novel Transform Feature to Current Time function is proposed for normalization, where features are shifted to current time and made available for further classification. A machine-learning algorithm is used to identify an author candidate. The experiments of the proposed methodology conducted on a set of text samples by several authors were collected over a different time period and the results show an improvement in performance.
