                <p><hi rend="italic">AustLit</hi> is
                    currently the most comprehensive and extensive online bibliography of a national
                    literature. Created in 2001, <hi rend="italic">AustLit </hi>merged a number of
                    existing specialist databases and bibliographies, and has subsequently involved
                    well over a hundred individual researchers – from multiple Australian
                    universities and the National Library of Australia – in an effort ‘to correct
                    unevenness and gaps in bibliographical coverage’ and continually update the
                    collection. The database has received significant government and institutional
                    funding and support, and includes bibliographical details on over 700,000 works
                    of Australian literature and secondary works on that literature. In addition to
                    its high degree of comprehensiveness, <hi rend="italic">AustLit</hi> is well
                    suited to quantitative and computational analysis due to its construction
                    according to established bibliographical standards and fields, which gives the
                    data a high degree of consistency across the collection. This study focuses on
                    Australian novels, the most comprehensively recorded aspect of <hi rend="italic"
                        >AustLit</hi>. Even so, <hi rend="italic">AustLit</hi> notes that its
                    ‘coverage of some popular fiction genres such as westerns and romances, and of
                    self-published works, is representative rather than full’.<note>AustLit. (2001-). About Scope. <ref target="http://www.austlit.edu.au/about/scope" type="external">http://www.austlit.edu.au/about/scope</ref> (accessed 25 March 2012).</note></p>

                <head>Methodology</head>
                <p>Although <hi rend="italic"
                        >AustLit</hi> is generally used by researches for individual queries, it
                    also has a guided search function that allows a large number of results to be
                    extracted as tagged text. Using this function I constructed searches that
                    returned information, including the author, date and place of publication and
                    genre, for all Australian novels published between 1945 and 2009. I then used
                    Apple OS X command lines to organize the data before exporting it to CSV format.
                    Once in this format, I searched all the author names in <hi rend="italic"
                        >AustLit </hi>to discover any pseudonyms and to determine if the authors
                    were male or female. I explored the data in Excel, using the pivot table
                    function to query the data and the chart function to visualize of trends over
                    time. </p>
                <p>My approach to this data is based on a combination of book
                    history’s awareness of the contingency and limitations of data, and the paradigm
                    of computer modeling as outlined by Willard McCarty in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Humanities Computing</hi>.<note>McCarty, W. (2005). Humanities Computing. London: Palgrave Macmillan.</note> Although there has
                    been virtually no conversation between the two fields, the methodological
                    underpinnings of book history and the digital humanities together signal
                    important directions for developing a critical and theoretically aware approach
                    to working with data in the humanities. Quantitative book historians explicitly
                    acknowledge the limited and mediated nature of data, and provide clear and
                    detailed accounts of the origins, biases and limitations of the literary
                    historical data they employ. In presenting their results, such scholars insist
                    that quantitative results provide a particular perspective, suited to the
                    investigation of some aspects of the literary field but not others, and offer
                    indications rather than proof of literary trends. As Robert Darnton writes, ‘In
                    struggling with [literary data], the historian works like a diagnostician who
                    searches for patterns in symptoms rather than a physicist who turns hard data
                    into firm conclusions’.<note>Darnton, R. (1996). The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France. New York: Norton, p. 169.</note></p>
                <p>Although developed
                    for use with language, McCarty notion of modeling – as an exploratory and
                    experimental practice, aimed not at producing final and definitive answers but
                    at enabling a process of investigation and speculation – can be adapted for
                    analysis and visualization of literary historical data, and employed in ways
                    that resonate productively with quantitative book historical methods.
                    Specifically, I used a modeling approach to explore a series of hypotheses about
                    trends in Australian literary history. For instance, the gender trends in
                    authorship in a given period might lead me to suppose a particular hypothesis
                    (such as the influence of second-wave feminism on constructions of authorship).
                    In enabling modification of or experimentation with data – for instance,
                    subtracting particular publishers or genres – modeling provides a way of testing
                    such ideas, with the results of different models either fulfilling and
                    strengthening, or challenging, the original hypothesis. This methodological
                    framework shows how relatively simple computational processes in Excel can
                    enable a process of thinking with the computer that reveals trends, conjunctions
                    and connections that could not otherwise be perceived.</p>
                <p>This combination
                    of book historical and digital humanities methods avoids what I see as
                    limitations in other ‘distant readings’ of the literary field, including Franco
                    Moretti’s well-known ‘experiment’ in literary history: <hi rend="italic">Graphs,
                        Maps, Trees</hi>.<note>Moretti, F. (2005). Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History. London: Verso.</note> In particular, the skeptical
                    approach to data encouraged by book history avoids the portrayal of quantitative
                    results as objective and transparent. Meanwhile, McCarty’s notion of modeling –
                    as a means of thinking with the computer – avoids the assumption that the
                    computer is a passive tool in the process of analysis and interpretation.</p>

                <p>Extracting data from this
                    online archive, visualizing and modeling it, has allowed me to address questions
                    of long-standing interest to literary scholars and to explore new and hitherto
                    unrecognized trends in Australian literary history. This paper illustrates the
                    potential of such research for literary studies with a case study that responds
                    to the conference theme of ‘digital diversity’. A major issue in literary
                    historical discussions of ‘diversity’ is the presence – or absence – of women
                    authors in the literary field. In contemporary literary studies (in Australia
                    and other national contexts), such discussion has focused on the period from the
                    late 1960s to the late 1980s, when second-wave feminism is said to have had its
                    major impact. This period is cited as a time of substantial growth in women’s
                    presence in the literary field, leading to increased diversity and a
                    deconstruction of the canon of male authors. Visualisations of the <hi
                        rend="italic">AustLit</hi> data allows me to explore whether this perception
                    of gender trends is warranted, while the process of modeling enables
                    investigation of the causes of the trend. </p>
                <p>In relation to gender trends
                    from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, the results of this study support the
                    longstanding perception that women’s involvement in the Australian novel field
                    increased at this time (see Figure 1, showing the proportion of Australian
                    novels by men and women from 1945 to 2009). However, the outcomes of the
                    modeling process significantly complicate the standard interpretation of this
                    trend, and the relationship between politics and the literary field it implies.
                    Contextualising this growth in women’s writing in relation to the genre of
                    Australian novels shows that the largest area of growth was in romance fiction,
                    a form of writing usually seen as inimical to second-wave feminism.</p>
                <p>Another challenge to existing interpretations of the relationship between
                    gender, politics and fiction emerges in the past two decades, when gender trends
                    in authorship are explored in the context of gender trends in critical
                    reception. In the 1970s and 1980s, even as romance fiction represented the
                    largest proportion of women’s publishing, critical attention to Australian women
                    writers in newspapers and academic journals increased (see Figure 2, depicting
                    the proportion of men and women among the top twenty most discussed Australian
                    novelists in these different forums and overall). The proportion of Australian
                    novels by women has continued to grow in the past two decades, such that they
                    write well over half of all Australian novels published in the 2000s (see Figure
                    1), and the proportion of romance fiction in this field has declined. Yet in
                    this same period, women writers have been less and less the subject of critical
                    discussion in newspapers. These results resonate with those recently presented
                    by Vida, an advocacy group for women writers, showing the same prevailing focus
                    on male authors in the book reviews of a wide range of major American and
                    European newspapers and magazines in 2010 and 2011, including <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Atlantic</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">London Review of Books</hi>, the
                        <hi rend="italic">New York Review of Books</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Times Literary Supplement</hi>.<note>Vida: Women in Literary Arts (2010). The Count 2010. <ref target="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2011-count" type="external">http://vidaweb.org/the-count-2010</ref> (accessed 19 June 2011);
                                Vida: Women in Literary Arts (2011). The Count 2010. (accessed 9 March 2012).</note></p>
                
                <p>Although women continue to be well represented in academic discussion of
                    Australian literature, the focus in that forum is on nineteenth-century authors,
                    whereas both contemporary and historical male authors are discussed. Despite the
                    impact of feminism on the Australian literary field, these results suggest that
                    the longstanding perception of the great author as a man is still influential.
                    Presence or representation is not, I argue, the only issue in determining the
                    success of diversity in the literary field. Other constructions – relating to
                    the genre in which fiction is written and gender trends in its reception – shape
                    the field in ways that only come into view on the level of trends: when the
                    literary field is approached as a system, using data-rich and computer-enabled
                    methods.</p>
