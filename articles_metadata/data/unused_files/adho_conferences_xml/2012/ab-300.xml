            <p>The current study will introduce the VL3 (Virtual Language Learning Lab) a
                    multidisciplinary project that brings together a variety of disciplines: from
                    Theoretical Linguistics, Second Language Acquisition and Second Language
                    Pedagogy to Computer Science and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The VL3
                    stands as a great example of how humanistic knowledge, when combined with the
                    power of the technology, can lead to the creation of innovative tools,
                    beneficial to society at large.</p>
                <p>Specifically, the VL3 aims to provide a virtual environment where (Spanish)
                    second language learners can work towards improving their communicative skills
                    in the target language, by participating in a set of predefined conversation
                    scenarios that closely mimic real life situations.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, the VL3 is heavily based on research within the fields of
                    Linguistics, Second Language Acquisition and Second Language Pedagogy; as such
                    an important part of this presentation will focus on introducing and explaining
                    the theoretical context for the development of the current project. We will then
                    proceed to show how this research has been applied in order to further develop
                    and refine the existing spoken dialogue system technology used by our partner,
                    Natural Language Inc.</p>
                <p>Although the importance of linguistic theory (phonology, morphology, syntax) to
                    the advances in the field of NLP has been pointed out by many (Matthews1993;
                    Schultze &amp; Gupta 2010), it continues to be a relationship that needs to be
                    explored in more detail. Without a doubt, greater attention paid to linguistic
                    research would lead to even more significant developments for natural language
                    processing technologies. Skeptics of such technologies claim that computer
                    programs will never be able to account for the complexity of the human language
                    (Salaberry 1996) and although it may well be the case that we will not be able
                    to fully describe something as unpredictable as human language, it is only by
                    maintaining a close relationship with linguistics, its discipline of study, that
                    any real attempt can be made.</p>
                <p>As such, in order to meet our objective of creating a highly developed technology
                    capable of processing human language as a whole with the highest degree of
                    accuracy possible, we will recur to recent theories of linguistics and second
                    language acquisition.</p>
                <p>Language technologies such as ones described above, are used in telephone
                    conversations where a person needing information is speaking to a machine
                    trained to understand human language (call centers, for example). Although these
                    technologies have enjoyed great success, they are most often limiting, in sense
                    that they are only trained to deal with highly specialized language. For example
                    a NL software employed by an internet service provider will only ‘understand’
                    language that is specific to this context. In fact, it is often the case that
                    these technologies are trained to only pick up on certain key words (home
                    internet, high speed, technical problems, billing, etc.) uttered by the person
                    on the phone and from that on, infer the purpose of the call. Should the caller
                    ask a question ‘outside’ this scenario, the machine will most likely not
                    understand. As such, it can be said that most of these technologies have divided
                    language into specific contexts and have focused on teaching computers to
                    ‘understand’ scenario-specific language. That is, they are trained to deduce the
                    meaning of an utterance by picking up on certain key words.</p>
                <p>The VL3 thus proposes to adopt and further adapt these technologies to the field
                    of foreign language learning and offer students much needed opportunities to
                    practice their target language in one-on-one conversations that imitate real
                    life situations. This of course implies the need of less restrictive NL
                    technology that is able to understand human language as a whole rather than only
                    context-specific language. Consequently, such a project demands a NL technology
                    that is based on grammatical analysis strategy rather than keyword spotting. </p>
                <p>The technology used by Natural Language Inc., our partner in this project, is
                    already superior to other existing ones mainly because it employs grammatical
                    strategies for understanding human language. Nonetheless, our research
                    experience within the fields of Linguistics, Second Language Acquisition and
                    Second Language Teaching, will allow us to further develop the existing
                    technology of Natural Language Inc. in order to successfully use it as a second
                    language-learning tool. Any speaker of a foreign language is well aware of the
                    challenge that lays in the process of learning a language other that one’s own
                    as well as the many different factors that come at play in the learning process.
                    The field of Second Language Acquisition has shown us that one such factor is
                    input in the foreign language. In fact, input has been described as ‘the single,
                    most important concept of second language acquisition’ (Gass 1997). Input
                    specifically refers to exposure to the target language (oral, written, formal,
                    informal etc.) and no one would argue that a second language can be learned in
                    isolation and with no exposure to it. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, it has been suggested that aside from input, interaction with a
                    native speaker also plays an important role in the process of second language
                    development. (Long 1981, 1983, 1996). As such, producing the target language as
                    part of the learning process (Swain 1985, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2005) has been
                    suggested as beneficial to the learner. One of the benefits of interaction as
                    part of the process of second language learning is what is known as ‘negative
                    evidence’ That is, when the learner says something that their interlocutor does
                    not understand, after some ‘negotiations for meaning’ take place, the
                    interlocutor may model the correct language form. Consequently, this feedback
                    received by the learner on their production will turn into more positive input.
                    Interaction strategies between native and non-native speakers such as
                    modifications, simplifications, paraphrasing etc. have been vastly studied as
                    well and have clearly shown their benefits to the language learner. </p>
                <p>Evidently, linguistic research can provide us with valuable information for the
                    development of a project such as the VL3. Throughout this presentation you will
                    have the opportunity to see how such research has been applied to the creation
                    of an effective online tool that will significantly impact the field of second
                    language pedagogy.</p>
