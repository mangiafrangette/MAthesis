                <p>Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654) was the best known name in seventeenth century
                    medical publishing in London and is listed in the <hi rend="italic">English
                        Short Title Catalogue</hi> (ESTC) as the author of more than 230 books and
                    as the translator of dozens more. An apothecary, man-midwife, and
                    astrophysician, Culpeper is best remembered as the translator and editor of the
                        <hi rend="italic">London Dispensatory</hi> (1649), an unlicensed and
                    best-selling translation of the <hi rend="italic">Pharmacopoeia
                    Londinensis</hi>, the official medicine book of the Royal College of Physicians.
                    However, modern scholarship tells us that Culpeper was only partly responsible
                    for his prodigious and lasting success. Much of his fame can be attributed to
                    the efforts of his many publishers and printers, who over several decades turned
                    the name Culpeper into a commercial brand by reprinting, reissuing, and
                    frequently misrepresenting the author’s relatively few authentic works (see
                    McCarl 1996; Furdell 2002). During his lifetime Culpeper became one of the first
                    names in scientific writing that could sell books. Books bearing his name were
                    widely published throughout the eighteenth century, and sporadically to the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>This paper takes the case of Culpeper as a pilot study of title pages as a form
                    of advertisement. Extra copies of title pages were commonly printed as flyers
                    and posted on booksellers’ stalls, hung on cleft sticks, or tacked to walls
                    (Shevlin 1999: 48). In the seventeenth century, the title page – including the
                    title of the work – was largely the domain of the bookseller and printer
                    (McKerrow 1928: 91; Shevlin 1999: 52), making title pages a part of what Genette
                    calls ‘publisher’s peritext’ (1997: 16). In this paper we investigate the
                    typographic and text-structural features of the title page in books attributed
                    to Culpeper. The work builds on an earlier pilot study (Tyrkkö 2011) that
                    identified the systematic nature in which printers and publishers made
                    commercial use of not only the name Culpeper, but also the paratextual features
                    of his previous books in an effort to emulate the style of his authentic works. </p>
                <p>To enable the structural and typographical analysis of these title pages, the
                    title pages of all books listed from the period 1649-1700 that mention
                    Culpeper’s name and are available at the British Library, Cambridge University
                    Library or Wellcome Trust Library were transcribed and annotated for structural
                    parts and named entities, as well as for visual features such as layout, graphic
                    elements, and different typefaces and font sizes thereof. The annotation process
                    started with the taking of close measurements, down to one fifth of a
                    millimeter, of the aforementioned elements from original artefacts, and was
                    completed using digital facsimiles from <hi rend="italic">Early English Books
                        Online</hi> (EEBO).</p>
                <p>The annotation scheme is based on the TEI P5 <hi rend="italic">Guidelines for
                        Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</hi>, using elements from the <hi
                        rend="italic">Core,</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Default text structure</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Names,
                        Dates, People, and Places</hi> modules to annotate the textual structure and
                    named entities, and elements from the <hi rend="italic">Core</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italic">Representation of primary sources</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tables, Formulæ, and Graphics</hi> modules to annotate the visual layout of
                    the title page. For the purposes of annotating the typographical layout with
                    sufficient accuracy and consistency, we have developed an experimental system
                    for annotating the different typefaces and their sizes, using the ’rend’
                    attribute and a controlled value set. This system – which is based on relating
                    the size of the different typefaces used on the title page to the absolutely
                    measured ’base type’ of the text – is intended to combine the benefits of
                    absolute and relative measurement and to alleviate the difficulties caused by
                    working with digital facsimiles, such as unknown scaling factors and distortion
                    of proportions. </p>
                <p>The quantitative analysis related the visual and structural features of the title
                    pages to the bibliographic and sociohistorical parameters of the texts – such as
                    stated target audience, format, identity and geographic location of the
                    publisher and printer, publication year (whether before or after Culpeper’s
                    death) and the known relationship of the text to Culpeper. This data is imported
                    into a database together with the abovementioned bibliographic and
                    sociohistorical data, obtained from the ESTC, the <hi rend="italic">British Book
                        Trade Index</hi> (BBTI), the <hi rend="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National
                        Biography</hi> (ODNB) and earlier book historical research. </p>
                <p>The database of paratextual, bibliographic and sociohistorical data will be
                    queried using methods of multivariate analysis to identify relationships between
                    the physical features of the title pages and the variables of their production
                    histories. The analyses will reveal diachronic trends in the design of title
                    pages bearing the name Culpeper, and bring to light the underlying factors which
                    influenced the decisions regarding the physical presentation of the texts and to
                    highlight the different means used by printers and publishers to market their
                    products. More specifically, this allows us to reconstruct a timeline of how the
                    commercial brand of Culpeper was created and identify which features of the
                    title page were specific to the brand, which were typical for the time and which
                    were specific to particular publisher’s or printer’s house style. The findings
                    will be examined in light of broader book historical scholarship on such
                    features in an effort to distinguish features specific to the corpus of Culpeper
                    books.</p>
