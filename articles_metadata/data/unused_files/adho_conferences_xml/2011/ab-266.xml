				<p class="noindent">Ever since the cultural turn in literary studies, literary scholarship has
					focused on examining the cultural work performed by texts. Indeed, one of the
					enduring theoretical innovations of the 1980s was the reconceptualization of
					literary value according to the concept of cultural work—the idea that texts
					should be evaluated not by the innate aesthetic or formal qualities they
					manifested, but according to their “designs upon their audience” and their
					ability “to make people think and act in a particular way” (Tompkins 1985). As a
					result, previously overlooked or marginalized texts have often been deemed
					suitable for study in the ensuing years based largely the on degree to which
					they are said to perform particular kinds of cultural work. In one familiar
					example from the arena of nineteenth-century American literature, scholars have
					come to see a stereotypically sentimental novel like <i>Uncle
						Tom’s Cabin</i> as a canonical work primarily because its complex
					entanglements with the politics of the antebellum United States allow it to be
					read— to cite Tompkins once more—as part of a “monumental effort to reorganize
					culture.” But while this approach has become an important characteristic of much
					literary scholarship, the question of <i>how</i> to measure a
					given text’s capacity to perform cultural work remains vague and often
					myopically focused on the synchronic significance of the work in question at a
					specific point in time. </p>

				<p class="noindent">In this paper we investigate the matter of cultural work from the vantage point
					offered by current scholarship in the digital humanities. We do so with an eye
					toward developing a model of literary history that draws on uniquely digital
					methods for structuring and formalizing intertextual relationships, and that
					make it possible to chart the cultural and formal significance of literary works
					across space and time. Specifically, we use Susanna Rowson’s late
					eighteenth-century sentimental novel <i>Charlotte Temple</i> as
					a case study in how digital literary history can evaluate the meaning and formal
					significance of a text diachronically. Often cited as one of the earliest
					American bestsellers, Rowson’s work was reprinted hundreds of times during the
					nineteenth century and was referenced repeatedly in an extensive body of
					writing, ranging from reviews and advertisements to melodramatic stage
					adaptations and ostensibly factual regional histories of the United States.
					Tracking the novel’s extended nineteenth-century afterlife through this complex
					network of external references, we demonstrate how the application of detailed
					interpretive markup to the multiple documents that reference <i>Charlotte Temple</i> (instead of the novel that would, more
					conventionally, be thought of as the “primary” text) enacts a theory of literary
					history in which concepts of cultural work may best be observed as phenomena
					that develop over time. </p>

				<p class="noindent">While the idea of interpretive markup is not new, it is most often used either as
					a means of recording a layer of scholarly annotation on some particular document
					or classifying portions of a document according to some external taxonomy. Both
					uses are supported, for instance, by the current version of the Text Encoding
					Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, which provides examples of specific methods for
					encoding “semantic or syntactic interpretation” using a set of standard TEI XML
					elements and attributes. In practice, though, discussions of interpretive markup
					in digital humanities projects often revolve around questions of readability and
					the appropriateness of stand-off versus inline markup (e.g. does excessive
					interpretive markup pose problems for human readability of encoded text?
					[Campbell 2002]), or issues of preservation, curation, and reliability (e.g.
					what challenges for encoding textual information accurately and reliably are
					created by allowing extensive interpretive markup? [Berrie et al. 2006]).
					Although such questions are important in certain contexts, our project treats
					them as less important than the question of how interpretive markup may be
					enlisted as a surface for scholarly analysis—that is, how interpretive
					structures can themselves be classified and interpreted. </p>

				<p class="noindent">Our project adapts several of the interpretive structures provided in TEI XML to
					represent the connection between specific formal properties in <i>Charlotte Temple</i> and external evidence of the novel’s broader cultural
					influence, as attested by external references to it. We record basic metadata
					about each external reference (author, title, date and location of publication,
					etc.) while also indicating which specific features of the novel the reference
					comments on, as well as the nature of that commentary. The result is a set of
					XML-encoded documents classified according to the interpretive work they do: a
					record, as it were, of how nineteenth-century readers interpreted and responded
					to the novel’s formal properties. At the same time, a secondary layer of
					interpretive markup further formalizes the relationships we identify across this
					primary layer of interpretation. Taken together, both layers provide substantial
					material for further abstraction: for instance, the automated generation of
					topic maps that represent a variety of cultural knowledge structures. The result
					is a web of connections in the form of citations, references, allusions,
					parodies, and comments spanning the nineteenth century, whose formalized
					structures constitute the interpretive tissue of digital literary history. The
					ability to map and visualize these structures, we argue, offers significantly
					new possibilities for observing cultural work as a phenomenon that evolves over
					time, and whose connection to particular texts is most productively understood
					as operating at the nexus of close reading and “distant reading” strategies. </p>

				<p class="noindent">Our work constitutes an initial small-scale experiment, but it has relevance for
					larger questions of scale, purpose, and method in both the digital humanities
					and conventional modes of literary scholarship. In particular, it suggests that
					although digital scholarship offers a potential reconceptualization of literary
					history, practices of literary history also pose interesting challenges for work
					in the digital humanities. In recent years, projects in the digital humanities
					have increasingly responded to the question of scale by refining methods for
					aggregating, classifying, and analyzing enormous bodies of textual material—in
					other words, by treating text as a mass of data that can yield meaningful
					responses to statistical analysis of its language. Whether offering answers to
					now-familiar questions about scale itself— “What do you do with a million
					books?”—or taking up Franco Moretti’s challenge to peer into the “cellars of
					culture” represented by the tens of thousands of unread and unknown novels
					published in the nineteenth century, text mining and other forms of
					“computational humanities” have been increasingly held up as a means of
					“checking the generalizations of literary history”(Crane 2006; Parry 2010;
					Pasanek and Sculley 2008). At the same time, long-running digital humanities
					projects with deep investments in scholarly text encoding have tended to
					approach literary history from the opposite direction, emphasizing how “craft
					encoding,” for instance, employs editorial methodologies and modes of textual
					scholarship that participate in “making literary history” in the digital medium
					(Flanders 2009; Dimock 2007). While neither approach directly contradicts the
					other—indeed, in practice they often coexist harmoniously—they inflect the
					concept of literary history in crucially different ways. The former often treats
					the machine-processable language of texts as a primary axis along which
					historical change in writing manifests itself: intertextual relationships are
					revealed in changing patterns of linguistic borrowing, with the emphasis on
					facilitating the “comparability of texts” (Mueller 2008). The latter, while
					still valuing intertextual comparison, tends to prioritize the documentary and
					contextual over the linguistic—for instance recording textual variation across
					editions of the same text, or formalizing through encoding “rich environmental
					contextualizations” for the study of particular texts (Folsom 2007). Our project
					borrows from both strategies, and in doing so seeks to demonstrate in practice a
					method by which digital literary history negotiates this apparent bifurcation. </p>
