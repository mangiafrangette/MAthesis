                <p class="noindent">The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism (DDB)
                    (http://buddhism-dict.net/ddb/subscribing_libraries.html), now on the Web for
                    more than 15 years, has come to be regarded as a primary reference work for the
                    field of Buddhist Studies. Containing over 54,000 entries, it is subscribed to
                    by more than 38 university libraries
                    (http://www.buddhism-dict.net/ddb/subscribing_libraries.html). It is supported
                    by the contributions of over 70 specialists, many of these recognized leaders in
                    the field. It can perhaps be described as example of the type of web resource
                    hoped for by Jaron Lanier in his book <i>You Are Not A
                        Gadget</i>, or something similar to the sort of thing envisioned by Joseph
                    Raben in his Busa lecture at the DH2010, in the sense of being the fruit of the
                    collaborative efforts of a community of scholars that has reached a degree of
                    status and sustainability such that it has been able to grow and thrive—despite
                    having little funding or the support of a major organization or team of
                    programmers—in the age where such resources are so readily eclipsed by the
                    combination of Wikipedia and Google. The field of Buddhist Studies has its own
                    reliable, scholarly-edited, fully documented and responsible online reference
                    work that has developed a center of gravity sufficient for it to continue to
                    grow as the resource that specialists turn to without hesitation, and to which
                    they may contribute knowing that they will be clearly accredited, and that what
                    they write will not be deleted or changed in the following moment by, for
                    example, a junior high school student.</p>
                <p class="noindent">With the DDB having a history almost equal in length to that of the WWWeb as we
                    know it (it went online in 1995), there is a wide range of issues that can be
                    discussed beyond its present technical structure. Of great importance are the
                    management strategies that have allowed its continued progress through the long
                    series of changes the Web has witnessed during this first epoch of the Internet.
                    How, exactly, can a project that is based on the continual development of
                    quantity and quality of reference data can continue to grow to the extent of
                    becoming the de facto primary field reference work after exhausting the first
                    couple initial grants, without either becoming a fully “pay-for” resource
                    (perhaps being bought out by a commercial enterprise of some sort), or being
                    supported by some private organization — an alternative fraught with the danger
                    of forcing the resource to co-opt its principles and its objectivity?</p>
                <p class="noindent">I began the compilation of the DDB and its companion CJKV-English Dictionary
                    (CJKV-E) in 1986, originally simply envisioning the eventual publication of the
                    usual printed work. In 1994, however, the Web made its appearance, and the
                    potential advantages of trying to develop a reference work online in a
                    collaborative manner were immediately apparent. So in the middle of 1995, I
                    converted my WordPerfect word-processor files to HTML, and placed the dictionary
                    on the web. To my great elation, I was soon contacted by a few good scholars
                    with similar interests, who were willing to offer both content and technical
                    advice.</p>
                <p class="noindent">During its first few years on the web, the DDB was maintained in a simple,
                    hard-linked HTML format. With the help of Christian Wittern, this source was
                    converted to SGML, and then XML. A major turning point in the history of the
                    project came in January 2001, when Michael Beddow offered to help with Web
                    implementation, and for the first time, the raw XML data was searched and
                    presented to users through a combination of Perl and XML/XSLT technology. At
                    that time, building a search engine that could deal with mixed Western/CJK text
                    in UTF-8 encoding was a not at all a simple matter, so Michael's search engine
                    was a bit of a novel creation—and was able to serve its purpose with only minor
                    tweaks up through most of 2010, for almost a full decade.</p>
                <p class="noindent">When Michael Beddow's search engine was set up in 2001, usage of the DDB
                    increased dramatically. Yet despite our repeated pleas for user contributions,
                    except for a very small number of “enlightened” individuals who somehow
                    naturally grasped the meaning of this strange new thing called “web
                    collaboration,” it became apparent that there were very, very few people
                    willing, on their own, to take five or ten minutes to write up and send us even
                    a couple of terms from their own research work. This lack of interest on the
                    part of users in making contributions was extremely disappointing. Thus, while
                    our password security system was originally set up to ward off hacking attempts,
                    we decided to experiment with using this apparatus to institute a two-tiered
                    system of access. In the first level, any user could access the data a limited
                    number of times in a 24-hour period, logging in as <i>guest</i>.
                    In the second level, contributors were granted unlimited access. We started off
                    setting the <i>guest</i> limit at fifty, but leaving it at this
                    amount for a few weeks we received neither complaints nor contributions. We then
                    began to gradually drop the number down to forty, thirty, and then twenty
                    searches in a day. At twenty, there was still nary a complaint made nor
                    contribution to be seen. But when we hit the number of ten, everything changed.
                    We were first bombarded with indignant complaints, but holding the line, and at
                    the same time lowering the minimum required level of contribution to the
                    equivalent of one A4 page for two years of access, eventually these complaints
                    began to turn into contributions. This was a watershed moment for the project,
                    because we found that once people contributed one time, most of them continued
                    to do so, whether voluntarily, or by continued prompting through this same
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p class="noindent">At the time of my first public presentation of the DDB at a meeting of the
                    Electronic Buddhist Text Initiative (EBTI http://buddhism-dict.net/ebti/) in
                    1996, the DDB contained approximately 3,200 entries. That number is now over
                    54,000, with a present average growth rate of 4,000 terms per year. The
                    continued growth in popularity of the DDB, especially as a reference work for
                    graduate and undergraduate courses in Buddhist Studies in North America and
                    Europe generated one more access problem that needed resolution—that of how to
                    allow for the use of the DDB in the case where an instructor wanted to use the
                    dictionary for an university course. To deal with these kinds of situations, we
                    decided to begin to offer subscriptions to university library networks for a
                    modest fee. This policy brought about an unforeseen benefit, in that we could
                    now provide a list of reputable institutions that had deemed the DDB to be an
                    academic reference of high standards. It also generated a small but steady
                    income, which allowed us to pay for hardware and software, and a couple of
                    part-time workers to do input and editing. Finally, in order to encourage
                    contribution from qualified scholars, great effort was expended toward letting
                    members of the field know of the contributions being made by their colleagues.
                    Thus on the dictionary's web site itself, as well as on associated news and mail
                    lists, information regarding new contributions is energetically distributed.</p>
                <p class="noindent">This presentation will start off with a short demonstration of the most advanced
                    functions of the DDB, to be followed by a brief overview of its technical
                    framework (P5- influenced XML, delivered through XSL and Perl). We will then
                    outline the above-introduced key factors of the management of the DDB that we
                    believe have most directly contributed to its great success.</p>
