                </h4><hr />
            
                <p class="noindent">Now almost fifty years old, Walter Houghton’s seminal work, <i>The
                        Victorian Frame of Mind, 1830-1870</i>, has influenced generations of
                    scholars of the nineteenth century and remains the primary introduction to
                    Victorian thought that every student in the field reads. From a close reading of
                    famous Victorian writers such as John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle, Houghton
                    argued that the Victorians were characterized by specific, common personality
                    traits such as optimism, hero worship, and earnestness. Houghton believed that
                    these traits were visible in the rise (or decline) in the use of particular
                    words and phrases, such as an increasing use of “light,” “sunlight,” and “hope”
                    as illustrative of their optimistic world view.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Despite the enormous impact of <i>The Victorian Frame of Mind</i>
                    on generations of scholars across the humanities, it has not been accepted
                    uncritically. Many concerns stem from Houghton’s myopic textual methodology:
                    generalizing the character of a people—“the Victorians”—from the words of a
                    select few. Although Houghton cites hundreds of primary sources in his
                    bibliography, his book has been characterized as anecdotal, elite intellectual
                    history. Despite such criticisms, Victorianists have been able neither to
                    thoroughly assess the general validity of Houghton’s theses nor to offer
                    alternatives.</p>
                <p class="noindent">New digital tools and the vast digital library of Google Books now allow us to
                    conduct a comprehensive survey of Victorian writing—not just the well-known
                    Mills and Carlyles, but tens of thousands of lesser-known or even forgotten
                    authors—to test whether the Victorians truly did use the kinds of words and
                    phrases that Houghton claimed they did. Did metaphors of hope <i>actually</i> increase in real terms between 1830 and 1870? Or was this
                    only true for the dozen prominent writers he examined for his chapter on
                    optimism? How can we complicate Houghton’s characterizations and understand
                    change over time through the vast index of Google Books? Can we refine the
                    timeline for the emergence of his characteristics, moving beyond the
                    disturbingly neat, rounded-year boundaries he set for his book? How can we
                    correlate historical events with disturbances in the linguistic data? To what
                    extent can we separate cultural history from printing history with a large
                    corpus of digitized literature?</p>
                <p class="noindent">Dan Cohen, my colleague at the Center for History and New Media, and I have begun
                    work on a project to answer these very questions. With the help of a Google
                    Digital Humanities Grant, we’re attempting what Franco Moretti calls a “distant
                    reading” of the Victorians. My paper will explain how we’ve gone about querying
                    the data available through Google Books, how we’ve been able to make sense of
                    and interpret the results, and how we’ve dealt with the messiness of the data. I
                    hope to solicit feedback about our methodologies and conclusions as part of a
                    larger discussion about how the Google Books corpus (and similar datasets) could
                    be made more usable for large-scale data mining projects relevant to the diverse
                    research interests of the audience. How far can we push our methodologies beyond
                    testing certain theses in order to allow the texts to speak for themselves?</p>
                <p class="noindent">In terms of the Victorians, some preliminary results have proven quite
                    intriguing. For example, the number of books published with “universal” in the
                    title declined steadily throughout the century, but earlier than most
                    interpretations in the secondary literature point out. A look at published
                    titles suggests that the terms “God,” “Christian,” and “Bible” follow rather
                    different contours, though explanations are not immediately apparent. Similarly,
                    how can we explain the striking publication parallels between the terms “belief”
                    and “Aristotle”? The median number of titles that use the word “hope” does not
                    significantly change between 1830 and 1870: does this cast some doubt on
                    Houghton’s characterizations? Or does it simply indicate that book titles are
                    not an accurate gauge of popular sentiment? We have not yet been able to examine
                    the full texts from the publications that are being counted, but we hope to do
                    that soon. To what extent will a more sophisticated linguistic analysis of the
                    full texts reinforce or contradict what the titles alone tell us? Does this have
                    implications for similar large-scale research methodologies?</p>
