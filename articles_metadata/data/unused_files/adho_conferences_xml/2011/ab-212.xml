                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="noindent">Over the years, digital libraries and textual archives have collected, described,
                    and classified texts and multimedia objects. These kinds of repositories are
                    effective in compiling, describing, and disseminating the cultural heritage such
                    as the artistic and literary expressions. Also, many of them, following the
                    developments of Computational Linguistics, have incorporated tools for textual
                    analysis as part of their end-user services. Nevertheless, these systems are
                    weak in terms of <i>relationships</i>. Of course, they are
                    configured in such way that it is possible to relate the digital objects
                    compiled; thus, for instance, it is easy to retrieve a set of visual artefacts
                    sharing the same subject matter. However, these relationships are based on the
                    traditional criteria of classification and description (metadata and keywords),
                    without any intention of exploring the nature or specific characteristics of the
                    relationships that the Art History discipline’s phenomena maintain among
                    them.</p>
                <p class="noindent">We should not overlook the intrinsic relationship that exists among texts,
                    concepts – or ideas –, words and visual artefacts in the construction of
                    art-historical knowledge (Mitchell, 1994). As Heffernan (2006) argues for the
                    case of words and images, this relationship should not taken as a simple
                    reproduction of art works by a set of words, but rather the conjunction of
                    visual artefacts and words generates new knowledge. This is one of the reasons
                    for which we can contend that these relationships deserve to be treated as a
                    research object in themselves.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Therefore, our intention is to explore the potential relationships that could be
                    established among these entities: texts, concepts, words, and visual artefacts
                    with the aim of investigating how these relationships are able to produce new
                    significant knowledge or are able to open new understandings.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Religo</h2>
                <p class="noindent"><i>Religo</i> is a system that enables the construction of
                    interpretations based on relationships. According to the researcher’s needs and
                    the art historian’s research habits and procedures, the question of <i>text and image</i> induces us to design a system to establish
                    relations between various kinds of objects (texts, images, videos, etc.), to
                    provide new possibilities for analysis and research, which are offered only
                    partly by the state of the art.</p>

   . working on texts and images – although with interesting and
                    useful features – some limitations can be found in terms of:</p>
                
                    <li>functionalities: only tagging or object manipulation;</li>
                    <li>usability: complex and without a user-friendly interface;</li>
                    <li>purpose: oriented to social participation (this feature often does not
                        reach the entire scholarly community).</li>
                
                <p class="noindent">Taking into account this state of the art, Religo does not reduce the
                    relationship to the concept of pure tagging or to the idea of simple connection
                    between entities, but treats it as basic element for interpretation and
                    analysis, making itself the subject of research in order to create new
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Religo relates the domain entities creating two logical levels: the expression
                    one, consisting of <i>digital objects</i> on which the
                    interpretation can be developed; and the semantic one, consisting of <i>digital concepts</i> (the relationships between digital
                    objects and the predications on themselves) that allow the interpretation to be
                    built (Buzzetti, 2004)This theoretical model has been used by Signum to
                        develop a system for facilitating semantic research and text reading in Text
                        and Semantics 
         (<a href="http://textandsemantic.signum.sns.it" target="blank">link</a>)
   ..</p>
                <p class="noindent">This means that, when a digital concept is the subject of interpretation, it is
                    placed on the expression level, becoming a digital object itself.</p>
                <p class="noindent">An example is the Michelangelo’s masterpiece <i>The Last
                        Judgement</i>, analysed and interpreted by the Spanish author Francisco
                    Pacheco in his 17<sup>th</sup> treatise <i>The Art of
                        Painting</i> (1649). In this case, <i>The Last
                        Judgement</i> would be the digital object, and the interpretation given by
                    Pacheco, the digital concept. However, insofar as the Pacheco’s interpretation
                    is also subject of interpretation and analysis by the modern historiography, it
                    in turn becomes a digital object.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The entities of the domain can be submitted to a number of general operations
                    (such as selection of parts, links, free tagging or metadata encoding, etc.) and
                    others more specific according to their particular features (specific operations
                    on texts and image).</p>
                <p class="noindent">In every operation the centrality of the relationship is clear: from its
                    creation, made easily by a simple <i>drag and drop</i> of
                    selected portions of objects, up to reach the composition of documents as result
                    of the different entities relationship that themselves constitute the new
                    knowledge of the study process.</p>
                <p class="noindent">A more evident utility of this new use of relationships can be seen in the search
                    and navigation functions, for example to improve the search capability because
                    it ensures a higher degree of <i>precision</i> and <i>recall</i><i>Precision</i> can be seen
                        as a measure of exactness or fidelity, whereas <i>recall</i>
                        is a measure of completeness..</p>
                <p class="noindent">As an example, searching for the word <i>emblema</i>, Religo
                    returns both entities containing <i>emblema</i> as textual
                    occurrence (W) and those where <i>emblema</i> does not appear
                    (NW) but which are related to W (Figure 1). Thus, the relationship gives
                    relevance and importance to the entity NW, which otherwise, from a purely
                    textual standpoint, would go unnoticed or simply would not exist.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Relationship also affects the display of the entities: that is, in addition to
                    the classical view <i>as list</i>, Religo provides a view <i>as graph</i>, creating a network between the various domain
                    entities which on one hand allows the reconstruction of interpretive reading by
                    simply moving the focus between digital objects, on the other hand enables a
                    contextualized vision of every digital object. These features, typically used
                    during the work process, are also useful in order to share and exploit the
                    research results.</p>
                <p class="noindent">As a more concrete example, let us consider the following domain:</p>
                <p class="noindent"><i>The Art of Painting</i> by Pacheco discusses Michelangelo and
                    his works, including <i>The Last Judgement</i>. It also treats
                    other painters such as Velázquez or Tiziano, other works such as <i>The Final Judgement</i> painted by Pacheco himself, the
                    portrait of King Phillip II painted byTiziano, and other artists such as Dolce,
                    Paleotti, Lomazzo, or Céspedes.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Religo allows relationships to be created between these objects:</p>

                        explanation of the painting; and <i>mention</i>, which only
                        means that the painting has been cited.</p>
                <p class="noindent">[<i>The Last Judgement of Michelangelo</i>] <b>influences on</b> [<i>The Last Judgement of

                        as example by</b> [<i>Dolce, Pacheco, Lomazzo,

                <p class="noindent">These relationships themselves become new entities of the domain, forming an

                    different theorists cited by Pacheco and the concepts that he defines in <i>The Art of Painting</i> until creating another richer
                    level:</p>
                <p class="noindent">[<i>The Last Judgement</i>] <b>used as example
                        by</b> [<i>Pacheco, Dolce</i>] <b>to
                        illustrate idea of</b> [<i>deviations of decoro</i>]</p>
                <p class="noindent">[<i>The Last Judgement of Michelangelo</i>] <b>used
                        as example by</b> [<i>Pacheco, Lomazzo</i>] <b>to illustrate the idea of</b> [<i>movements and
                        affetti</i>]</p>
                <p class="noindent">[<i>The Last Judgement of Michelangelo</i>] <b>used
                        as example by</b> [<i>Pacheco, Céspedes</i>] <b>to illustrate the idea of</b> [<i>terribilità</i>]</p>
                <p class="noindent">What we can deduce from this result is that, from the second half of 16<sup>th</sup> century, <i>The Last Judgement</i> by
                    Michelangelo plays the role of universal reference to illustrate or exemplify a
                    wide range of aspects concerning the visual arts, being used by each author in a
                    different way. <i>The Art of Painting</i>, as an encyclopaedic
                    treatise, brings together many of these interpretations, which Pacheco unifies
                    into a single point of view.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The most interesting results arise when we use a complete repository of works,
                    images, and texts. For example, if we consider a repository of Spanish 17<sup>th</sup> treatises, as ATENEA Project
         (<a href="http://www.proyectoatenea.es" target="blank">link</a>)
   , we might find the
                    following types of relationships:</p>
                <p class="noindent">[<i>The Last Judgement of Michelangelo</i>] <b>described by</b> [<i>Pacheco</i>, 1649] and [<i>Carducho</i>, 1634] only <b>mentioned by</b>
                        [<i>Martínez</i>, ca. 1675]</p>
                <p class="noindent">[<i>The Last Judgement of Michelangelo</i>] <b>described by</b> [<i>Pacheco</i>] and [<i>Carducho</i>] <b>with coinciding terms</b> [<i>confusión, temor, horribilidad, terrible</i>].</p>

            
            
                <h2>Conclusions and Future Developments</h2>
                <p class="noindent">As an initial task, Religo is provided with all the typical features to operate
                    on texts and images in terms of combination of interacting tools for example to
                    describe and catalogue visual artefacts, to analyse images, to manipulate
                    images, or to annotate images (whole or partly).</p>
                <p class="noindent">Together with the standalone version, an online should be allowed in order to
                    ensure content sharing and social tagging in expert contexts of usage.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Moreover, the system would be generalized for use in other different domains and
                    would have the capacity to handle other types of entities such as audio and
                    video.</p>
