                </h4><hr />
            

                <p class="noindent">Faceted browsing is a recent paradigm in search interfaces that allows users with
                    little familiarity of a subject domain to quickly explore the contents of
                    databases or other structured data sources. The underlying principle of this
                    approach can be traced back to the work of Indian librarian S.R. Ranganathan,
                    who, in contrast with traditional top-down, taxonomical approaches to subject
                    classification, in 1933 developed a method for organizing subjects in a
                    bottom-up and non-hierarchical fashion. According to this model, a
                    classification system can be created by combining together subject descriptors
                    chosen from a number of non-exclusive and non-hierarchical facets – e.g., in the
                    context of classifying books, these can be genre, date or author. This method
                    supports the generation of a flexible system that better represents the
                    multitude of perspectives we could use to represent knowledge (Broughton,
                    2004).</p>

                <p class="noindent">As a result of the adoption of these ideas in computer science, researchers have
                    been creating search interfaces that allow the exploration of digital resources
                    through the manipulation of filters describing important features of a subject
                    domain (Broughton 2002). A well-known pioneer in this area is Marti Hearst with
                    her work on the Flamenco faceted browser (Hearst, 2002), followed by a number of
                    similar approaches that, in general, aimed at creating more compelling and
                    easy-to-use user interfaces (Hearst, 2008) (Capra, 2007) or at providing
                    software packages that can work with different types of data sources; these may
                    vary from manually editable JSON files (Huynh, 2007) to databases
                    (Stuckenschmidt, 2004) and RDF triplestores (Oren, 2006). A number of projects
                    have also proven the usefulness of this type of interfaces to the aim of
                    facilitating the navigation of large repositories of humanities data, such as
                    artwork images (Hildebrand, 2006), music resources (Bretherton, 2009) or
                    multi-genre collections (McGann, 2007).</p>


                <p class="noindent">The success of faceted interfaces can be related to the fact that they implement
                    a schema-less approach to classification, that is to say, they make available to
                    the user a number of co-existing search dimensions that can be simultaneously
                    used to browse and preview the contents of a digital repository. Many are the
                    proven advantages of such an approach (Perugini, 2010): first, users are never
                    asked to 'guess' the right search terms, as it happens in classic keyword search
                    interfaces; second, inconclusive searches are prevented; third, non-experts can
                    easily 'get a feeling' for the significance and meaning of the data available
                    just by looking at the available facets, thus increasing their understanding of
                    the domain. In conclusion, this type of interfaces simplify enormously the
                    exploration of a digital repository, and, using the words of Nowivskie, they
                    make it easy to “explore lateral relationships” to the point that they open
                    “possibilities for algorithmic serendipity in research” (Nowivskie, 2007).</p>

                <p class="noindent">An important feature that most of the existing faceted browsers have in common is
                    that the different facets available equally concur to the selection of a single
                    result-type. For example, by manipulating variables such as the <i>color</i> and the <i>making</i> of cars, we
                    can navigate a data-space of available cars; by choosing filters representing
                    information about <i>genres</i>, <i>publishers</i> and <i>years of publication</i> we can
                    easily narrow down a result list of books; or, in the context of a
                    prosopographical database, by accumulating descriptors about people's <i>forenames</i>, <i>surnames</i>, or <i>gender</i> we would be able to refine our search for the <i>individuals</i> mentioned in the database.</p>
                <p class="noindent">In our work, we intended to push the boundaries of this approach by creating a
                    faceted browsing engine that, given the same set of selectable facets, can be
                    used to search for ‘ontologically distant’ entity types. For example, in the
                    context of a prosopographical database, by manipulating the same group of
                    filtering options, we aimed at letting users search not just for <i>people</i>, but also for <i>factoids</i> and
                        <i>sources</i> (cf. Figure 1). In doing so, we assumed that
                    rich and highly interconnected humanities databases call for more powerful
                    search mechanisms; such mechanisms should be capable of revealing the
                    intricacies of a subject domain to the casual learner, and, at the same time, of
                    providing a higher level of 'algorithmic serendipity' to the academic scholar.
                    In other words, we aimed at making more visible the large number of search
                    pathways a highly structured database can make possible - as opposed to hiding
                    this complexity by providing a unique entry point to the wealth of data
                    available. This means that, as shown in fig. 1, by using facets typical of the
                    'people' result-type (such as <i>surname</i> or <i>gender</i>) we would like to be able to search for 'sources'
                    or 'factoids'. Or, by choosing facets typical of the 'sources' result-type (such
                    as <i>document category</i> or <i>language</i>)
                    we may want to filter results when searching for 'people'.</p>
                <p class="noindent">With this vision in mind we created DJFacetThe software is open source and
                        freely available online at the url 
         (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/djfacet/" target="blank">link</a>)
   , a faceted browsing
                    engine that lets users create powerful, multi-result search interfaces. DJFacet
                    is written in Python and is based on Django, a popular web application
                            framework
         (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" target="blank">link</a>)
    that
                    facilitates the development of database-driven websites by providing
                    functionalities that speed up the creation of repetitive tasks. In particular,
                    one key component of this framework is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), that
                    is, a set of functions that provide programmers with a level of abstraction
                    between the database and the application language; as a result, it is possible
                    to invoke complex database queries without having to write any SQL code. This
                    makes the whole application easier to manage and more portable across different
                    database engines.</p>
                <p class="noindent">By building on the functionalities of Django ORM, DJFacet provides a customizable
                    and easy-to-use environment for creating database-driven faceted search
                    applications. The underlying idea of DJFacet is that since a data-structure had
                    already been designed and fine-tuned when the database was created, that same
                    structure could be used to define the search dimensions of the faceted browser
                    with little extra work required. An instance of DJFacet can run just by creating
                    an initialization file in which we define which are the available facets and
                    what 'behaviour' they have with respect to the database schema. The software
                    then calculates automatically all the remaining query-paths needed to show the
                    results in the various searches.</p>
                <p class="noindent">At the time of writing, we tested DJFacet's approach with two humanities
                    databases. The Paradox Of Medieval Scotland project
         (<a href="www.poms.ac.uk" target="blank">link</a>)
    (POMS) investigates how a recognizably
                    modern Scottish identity was formed during the period 1093-1286. Drawing on over
                    6000 contemporary charters, it provides biographical information about all known
                    people in Scotland during that period. In this context we built a search
                    interface that features 29 facets, organized into 5 groups (cf. figure 2). The
                    result types are 3 (<i>people</i>, <i>factoids</i> and <i>sources</i>).</p>
                <p class="noindent">The Early Modern London Theatres
         (<a href="www.emlot.kcl.ac.uk" target="blank">link</a>)
   
                    (EMLoT) project provides its users with a major encyclopedic resource on the
                    early London stage, as well as a comprehensive historiographical survey of the
                    field. EMLoT identifies, records and assesses transcriptions from primary-source
                    materials relating to the early London stage, as found in secondary-source print
                    and manuscript documents. In this case the faceted search interface contains 24
                    facets, organized into 5 groups. The result types are 7 (<i>transcription records, primary sources, secondary sources, events, people,
                        troupes, venues</i>).</p>
                <p class="noindent">By using DJFacet it was possible to allow the formulation of queries that might
                    not be immediately obvious to the user. For example, in POMS it became trivial
                    to search for Charters mentioning transaction events in which 'beneficiaries' of
                    name 'William' acquire something on the day of the 'Feast of St Patrick '. Also,
                    the search interface provided users with more chances of coming across
                    interesting connections in the available materials. This was made possible by
                    the fact that the facets used in the search are ontologically distant from the
                    respective result-types.</p>
                <p class="noindent">However, despite the fact that this approach proved to be, from the logical and
                    computational point of view, completely feasible, it also opened up a number of
                    research questions from the point of view of the meaning of these multifaceted
                    searches across different results types. In other words, we realized that often
                    the accumulation of filters ontologically distant from each other could be
                    hardly translated by the end user into real-world questions; analogously, the
                    opposite may happen, in so far as simple type of searches may be impeded by the
                    highly structured architecture of a faceted browser.</p>
                <p class="noindent">In order to provide some answers to this issue and lay the ground for a more
                    scientific discussion of the problem we are currently carrying out a user
                    evaluation study with humanities scholars. The purpose of the experiment is to
                    discover the degree to which humanities scholars can make sense of the search
                    mechanisms provided by our faceted browser, and, indirectly, of the complex data
                    structures often necessary for representing humanities subjects. We will report
                    on these findings at the conference, together with a deeper analysis of the
                    implications of using multi-result faceted browsers in the context of complex
                    humanities datasets.</p>
