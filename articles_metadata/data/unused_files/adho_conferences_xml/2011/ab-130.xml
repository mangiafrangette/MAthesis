                    Hoover, David L., 
                    New York University, 
                    <a href="mailto:david.hoover@nyu.edu">david.hoover@nyu.edu</a>
                </h4><hr />
            

                <p class="noindent">I have already argued against the widely held belief that Henry James's switch
                    from handwriting to dictation caused a radical change in his style (Hoover
                    2009). However, the wider question of how mode of composition affects literary
                    style remains open, and James might be the exception rather than the rule. I
                    report here on some preliminary studies for a more comprehensive examination of
                    writers who changed their mode of composition either temporarily or permanently.
                    The three authors examined here, Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, and Walter Scott,
                    present clear cases of changes from handwriting to dictation (and back), ones in
                    which the details of composition are well known, and in which the changes in
                    mode of composition take place within a single text.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The case of Thomas Hardy is slightly problematic because he was not always
                    truthful about his wife's role in the production of his books, and in some cases
                    burned some MS pages in her hand. For <i>A Laodicean</i>, one of
                    his less important novels, however, the facts seem fairly clear. After sending
                    the first three (of thirteen) installments of the serial version to the printer,
                    Hardy fell ill, suffering from some kind of bladder inflamation. He struggled
                    through the fourth installment, but his doctor then gave him the choice of lying
                    with his feet higher than his head or an operation. Choosing the former required
                    him to dictate much of the novel, though he was able to correct proofs. He
                    eventually became “less and less dependent on dictation, writing the final
                    sections of the manuscript in his own hand.” He mentions writing parts of
                    installment twelve in a letter (Milgate 2006: 204), and this suggests he also
                    wrote part thirteen.</p>
                <p class="noindent">To test for any dramatic effect of the switch to dictation, I divided the novel
                    into four parts, the handwritten installmens1-4, the dictated 5-11, and the
                    partially or wholly handwritten 12 and 13, and further divided these
                    installments into sections of about 9,000 words. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the
                    sections of the novel strongly tend to group together chronologically, though
                    the beginning, 1-4 HW (1), is somewhat unusual, as often happens with the
                    beginnings of novels, and 5-11 D (5) is also an outlier. At first, Fig. 1 seems
                    to support a distinction between handwritten and dictated parts, but the
                    presence of the largely handwritten installments 12 and 13 among the dictated
                    parts suggests that narrative structure is a more potent force than mode of
                    composition. Further work will be necessary to test other characteristics of the
                    text, but the analysis shown in Fig. 1, along with many others based on shorter
                    sections, does not suggest that Hardy's mode of composition radically affected
                    his style.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Joseph Conrad presents a more complex problem. Several of his texts were partly
                    dictated, including three I will examine here, the novellas <i>The End of the Tether</i> and <i>The Shadow-Line</i>, and
                    novel <i>The Rescue</i>. Conrad dictated the second serial
                    installment of “The End of the Tether” to Ford Maddox Ford under time pressure
                    after part of the manuscript was accidentally burnt. I have separated the
                    beginning and the burnt installment from the rest of the story, and have
                    analyzed the parts in sections of about 2,600 words. As Fig. 2 shows, the first
                    two sections of the dictated (burnt) installment cluster with the handwritten
                    beginning of the story, while the last section clusters with the handwritten
                    rest of the story. The narrative structure is again quite clear here, but there
                    is nothing to suggest that dictation altered Conrad's style.</p>
                <p class="noindent">

                </p>
                <p class="noindent">About one-fourth of <i>The Shadow Line</i>, beginning a little
                    more than half-way through the novella, were dictated. Conrad himself ponders
                    the possible effect of mode of composition, suggesting that “it will be curious
                    for critics to compare my dictated to my written manner of expressing myself”
                    (Conrad 1983: 543) . As with <i>The End of the Tether</i>,
                    however, there is little evidence of any affect of dictation on the style of the
                    novel, as Fig. 3 shows. Analyses based on different numbers of words vary
                    somewhat, but the separate cluster containing the first four sections of the
                    novel is very stable, and all analyses group the fifth handwritten section of
                    the beginning of the novel with the dictated sections that immediately follow
                    it. Again, narrative structure trumps any effect of the change in mode of
                    composition.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="noindent">The composition of <i>The Rescue</i> is unusual in that Conrad
                    first worked on this novel from 1896 to 1898, but did not finish it until
                    1918-1919. The early part was handwritten, while the end was dictated. Although
                    Conrad suggests that the novel might prove interesting as a case of style
                    evolution, readers have found the style “homogeneous” (Karl 1979: 816). Here I
                    divided the novel into dictated and handwritten parts, and cut them into
                    sections of about 5,000 words for analysis. As Fig. 4 shows, the first two
                    dictated parts cluster with the handwritten parts, and the 7<sup>th</sup> handwritten section clusters with the dictated parts. This pattern
                    is extremely stable in analyses based on the 990-600 MFW, and all analyses show
                    a mixing of sections produced by the two modes. Further tests based on other
                    textual features will be needed to make the case more strongly, but, for Conrad,
                    as for James and Hardy, the mode of composition has no obvious effect on
                    style.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Turning to Walter Scott, we find a different scenario. About a third of the way
                    through his career, Scott was writing very rapidly in an attempt to pay off an
                    enormous debt. While writing <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> in
                    1818-19, he suffered from increasingly severe stomach pains (probably from
                    gall-stone disease) that prevented him from writing, and finished the novel by
                    dictation, though it is not entirely clear exactly where the dictation begins.
                    The final extant MS leaf corresponds to Chapter 26 (of 33), but it ends with a
                    catch word and has corrections for later leaves on the reverse (Milgate 1987:
                    170). We can be sure, however, that much, and probably most, of the last seven
                    chapters were dictated. I have divided the novel into the part corresponding to
                    the MS and the rest, and have divided both parts into sections of about 5,000
                    words. The important peculiarities of the pattern shown in Fig. 5 remain
                    constant over many analyses. The first part of the novel for which no MS exists
                    clusters (loosely) with the final two chapters of MS (though also with
                    handwritten sections 6-12), but the handwritten sections 13-17 cluster with the
                    handwritten beginning of the novel and the other three sections for which no MS
                    exists. This peculiar pattern needs further study, but it does not support a
                    difference between Scott's dictated and handwritten styles.</p>

                <p class="noindent">Because of continuing stomach pain, Scott also dictated about half of <i>Ivanhoe</i>, but finished the novel by hand after he began to
                    recover. I have divided the novel into handwritten and dictated sections of
                    about 9,000 words. The analysis in Fig. 6 shows that here, as before, there is
                    no evidence of a significant shift in style when Scott's mode of composition
                    changed. The last dictated section clusters with the following MS sections,
                    while the next to last MS section, MS (9), clusters with the dictated sections.
                    When fewer words are analyzed MS (9) shifts to the MS cluster, but Dict. (9)
                    then also moves into the MS cluster. The most reasonable interpretation of this
                    behavior is that the last dictated sections are similar to the adjacent MS
                    sections, and that the important factor is again narrative structure rather than
                    mode of composition.</p>

                <p class="noindent">More analysis of other cases, especially those involving typewriting and
                    word-processing, where some evidence for significant effects exists from
                    composition studies, will be needed before any strong generalizations are
                    possible. Yet the evidence from James and the three authors examined here
                    strongly suggests that mode of composition has remarkably little effect on
                    authorial style.The tempting conclusion that the authors' revisions may
                        have erased any effects of the changes in mode of composition has some
                        support from the heavy revisions of James and Conrad, but Hardy was
                        apparently not a heavy reviser, and Scott famously revised very
                        little.</p>
