                <h2></h2>
                <p class="noindent">The UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology (UEE) is a digitally born online publication
                    which provides users with several interfaces to access and reproduce content.
                    Supported by several grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the
                    UEE is a highly mediated, peer reviewed information resource on Egyptian
                    history, art, archaeology, geography and language, in which authors selected by
                    an editorial committee are commissioned to write substantial articles with
                    thorough bibliographies and web links. Articles will be regularly updated and
                    previous versions of the text and other assets will remain available throughout
                    the lifetime of the resource, which in principle is built for digital eternity.
                    This time scale may prove not to be of the same longevity as the preservation of
                    ancient Egyptian cultural heritage, but is nevertheless fitting the mindset of
                    scholars who routinely deal with objects of 4000 years old.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The UEE is an English language resource, while all head words or entry titles are
                    translated also in Arabic, French and German. The English abstracts are also
                    translated in Arabic and a standard feature of each article. The content of the
                    UEE is available in two forms: the Open Version makes use of eScholarschip, the
                    online publication platform of the University of California. Articles are
                    presented in alphabetic order of the titles, and can be downloaded as PDF (<a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-102.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://escholarship.org/uc/nelc_uee#X" target="_top">http://escholarship.org/uc/nelc_uee</a>). The UEE Full Version provides a
                    much more sophisticated platform, where users can access information through a
                    wide range of searches, either based on the underlying subject structure,
                    article links, metadata, or through an interactive time-map, which provides
                    access to articles, images and 3D VR reconstructions which refer to the same
                    area, the same time period or both. The granularity of the time map encompasses
                    regions (using either modern or ancient subdivisions), ancient sites, or
                    particular features of the latter, such as a specific gate way, or altar. At
                    present the Full Version is not yet publicly online, but will be moved from
                    development to production in the near future. Information on the URL will be
                    provided on the UEE project development website at <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-102.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://uee.ucla.edu#X" target="_top">http://uee.ucla.edu</a>.</p>
                <p class="noindent">The presentation will focus on the many lessons learned while developing the
                    project, including the workflow of all the tasks which are literally performed
                    “behind the screen”. Since this is an international project with editors in the
                    United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Great Britain, and Egypt, with authors
                    as well as peer reviewers from all over the world, the project relies on a large
                    number of disparate web services, which are partly for free, partly subscription
                    based. The commissioning phase is tracked through a number of online spread
                    sheets through Google Docs. Authors receive an invitation by email, which
                    provides them with the scope of the entry, a document with clear indications of
                    what should (not) be included, in order to avoid duplication with related
                    articles. Once an article has been submitted, the peer review platform provided
                    by eScholarship, is used, which enables tracking and automated prodding for
                    authors and peer reviewers. Since many of the authors are non-native speakers of
                    English, the UEE offers a substantive copy-editing service, which streamlines
                    the terminology, spelling and links of the articles. The project coordination,
                    which involves communication on the progress of the extensive mark-up in TEI
                    which is the next phase of bringing an article to online publication, makes use
                    of the commercial project management software BaseCamp (<a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-102.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://37signals.com/#X" target="_top">http://37signals.com/</a>).</p>
                <p class="noindent">An important point of discussion is the digital and financial sustainability and
                    the different solutions the UEE has proposed to enable the project to expand and
                    be constantly renewed, which is perhaps the greatest asset of an online
                    resource. The history of the venerable printed predecessor of the UEE, the
                    Lexikon der Ägyptologie (published from , shows that bibliographies are outdated
                    in five years after publication, while Egyptological scholarship begins to be
                    outdated in approximately 20 years. Authors are therefore asked to provide twice
                    an update of their article, and after that potentially a new entry will be
                    created, because the development of the discipline is not only reflected in
                    article content, but also in the structure of the resource, the selection of
                    entry titles, and the emphasis on particular sub fields. The strict version
                    control has, therefore, an added benefit: over the course of time the UEE will
                    become effectively a history of Egyptological thought and methodology.</p>
                <p class="noindent">This requires, however, that the digital content remains available, and that the
                    editorial process will keep on running, two very demanding conditions. As for
                    digital stability: all assets of the UEE are housed in the UCLA Digital Library,
                    and are accessed from a front-end server which is at present housed at UCLA’s
                    Academic Technology Services. This agreement does not necessarily guarantee
                    digital preservation, because the libraries, at the forefront of digital
                    repository preservation as they are, are also faced with the enormous costs and
                    practical problems of digital preservation. The awareness of the problem is,
                    however, a considerable part of the solution. The financial sustainability is an
                    enormous conundrum. Users have come to expect free, high quality content,
                    academics celebrate the virtue of open access, and yet to build a high quality
                    resource comes with very real costs that need to be covered. The presentation
                    will outline some of the avenues explored to ensure that the UEE will have a
                    long prosperous life.</p>
