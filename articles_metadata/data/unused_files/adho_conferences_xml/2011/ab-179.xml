                <p class="noindent">Uncovering and detecting patterns of information in library and museum collection
                    items requires the integration of scholarly and scientific data analyses.
                    Research into the materials substrate (paper, parchment, etc) and media (ink,
                    pigment, colorant) that comprise the historic object inform the scholar as to
                    the provenance of a particular document. This may be through characterization
                    and identification of the media and substrate on which the information is
                    contained, or watermark identification that can effectively date the document to
                    a specific time period. The challenge of linking disparate materials
                    characterization and identification databases and scientific analyses is a
                    critical research issue requiring the development of a knowledge representation
                    (KR) to facilitate interpretation that enables this humanities research. With
                    cultural heritage objects, the KR must maintain linkage between the original
                    document that contains a wealth of knowledge stored contextually, and digital
                    surrogates that represent the document. These links will be explored in
                    reference to cultural treasures of South America, where the integration of
                    scientific analyses and historic scholarly information led to the generation of
                    knowledge that enriched the contextual interpretation of the original object.
                    Scientific analyses of textile treasures from Llullaillaco provided an
                    understanding of their use and purpose, while environmental information of
                    Pre-classic Mayan structures in the Mirador Basin allowed an assessment of
                    preservation requirements. Investigations of maps with specific links to South
                    America yielded information on the source of pigments and geographical location
                    of their original creation.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Historic documents and cultural heritage objects do not generally lend themselves
                    to ease of context analysis, since documentation about the creation of the
                    document is not readily available. Discovery of data with more detail about the
                    context and circumstances that surround the creation of the artifact allows
                    researchers to visualize information previously not detected. This visualization
                    is achieved in Library of Congress studies through advanced spectral imaging
                    techniques that incorporates data from both visible and non-visible regions of
                    the spectrum to create an integrated “digital cultural object” (DCO). The
                    additional contextual information is not apparent in conventional digitization
                    techniques for these objects, so the integration of the spectral data assists in
                    mining the layers of data stored within the objects. In this way the DCO
                    provides a range of information that allows a shift from the use of interpretive
                    virtual heritage applications that focus on the artistic rather than the
                    investigative and inferential, towards the development of interdisciplinary
                    scientific data analyses as part of cultural heritage humanities scholarly
                    studies. In this way, cultural heritage, science and technology are intertwined,
                    advancing the capacity to mine and analyze historic data from multiple
                    viewpoints. Interaction and interpretation of these additional dimensions allow
                    the description of new relationships between constituent elements, connecting
                    patterns and mining the data for trends, and correlating formerly disparate
                    components. For example, the new identification of pigments in an object that
                    come from a different geographical location, can then suggests trade routes and
                    exchange of materials and artistic techniques. The <i>UNESCO
                        Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage</i> has recognized the
                    importance of digital versions of cultural materials, referring to digital
                    heritage as “resources of information and creative expression” being
                    “increasingly produced, distributed, accessed and maintained in digital
                    form.”</p>
                <p class="noindent">The composite of images of the maps and textiles that forms the new DCO is
                    related to, but distinct from the originals. This digital object is not a
                    surrogate for the original, but provides new knowledge through the integration
                    of scientific analysis of these cultural heritage objects within libraries,
                    museums and archives. The range of data this new digital object contains
                    enhances interaction between a range of professions, allowing multidisciplinary
                    collaboration for integration of preservation, sociological and cultural
                    information. Digitally generated and accessed data for these maps and textiles
                    balances the opposing goals of libraries and museums and optimizes preservation
                    of the original objects, while increasing access to information from the
                    original. Hyperspectral imaging allows the DCO to create a new interpretation of
                    the original object, as apparent from the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the
                    original woodcut of the Waldseemüller 1507 world. Since these original
                    manufacturing materials no longer exist, the DCO allows the representation of
                    this new scientific knowledge to link with geography and map curatorial
                    knowledge of the era, and assist a greater understanding of the printing
                    techniques and possible location of where these materials originated. This was
                    the first time America was referred to as America, on any map, printed or
                    manuscript, with a unique perspective of South America.</p>

                    <img class="inline" src="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//179/figure1.png" /><p><a href="javascript://" onclick="javascript:window.open('http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-179.xml&amp;doc.view=popup&amp;fig.ent=http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/data/tei//179/figure1.png','popup','width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes')">Full Size Image </a></p>
                </p>
                <p class="noindent">Image capture and processing of these and other objects is important for the
                    interpretation of cultural heritage by allowing layers of data to be analyzed
                    and linked. This offers an archeological examination of the information strata,
                    the materials, inter-connections between the materials used, discovered text and
                    information, and the relative associations between the components of the
                    artifact. The creation of an image data-cube deconstructs layers of data into
                    discrete components, while conversely also integrating and utilizing the
                    application of scientific methods to the recognition of areas of interest within
                    the artifact. The explanations generated from these processes expand the
                    associations and extracted knowledge of the original cultural heritage
                    objects.</p>
                <p class="noindent">There is dynamic interaction between re-examination of the original or source
                    materials and the DCO, with raw and processed data that can enhance obscured and
                    specific features. Inter-connections and relationships between the source and
                    the generated interpretations based upon analysis of generated data are an
                    iterative process. The process of interpretation relies upon the use of implicit
                    assumptions, inferences or internal filtering. For both scientific and scholarly
                    researchers, these processes are often based upon prior knowledge and
                    experience. Additional filtering for scientific analyses are introduced by
                    reference databases that match known reference materials with “pixel” samples
                    taken from the spectral images to non-invasively characterize materials. These
                    categorizations are objective in nature and reduce the potential error sometimes
                    introduced by subjective assumptions. However, the essential element that should
                    not be overlooked in this iterative process is the power of strong
                    collaborations between a range of disciplines. In 1999 on Llullaillaco's summit,
                    an Argentine-Peruvian expedition co-directed by Johan Reinhard and Argentine
                    archaeologist Constanza Ceruti found the perfectly preserved bodies of three
                        <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-179.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca#X" target="_top">Inca</a>
                    children, <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-179.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice#X" target="_top">sacrificed</a> approximately 500 years earlier. These were
                    accompanied by a range of textiles, figurines and other ceremonial sacrificial
                    materials. A close collaboration between the American Museum of Natural History,
                    preservation scientists, engineers from Argentina and the USA, conservators and
                    curators was critical to ensuring the preservation of these unique materials.
                    The interweaving of the assessment of current condition of the cultural
                    artifacts such as strength and chemical degradation to aid their preservation,
                    with scholarly analysis of the unique patterns of construction enabled the
                    knowledge of both to be linked so as to create a rare collaboration of the
                    forensic type recovery of the history of these materials. This is the highest
                    Inca burial so far discovered and the world's highest archaeological sit. There
                    was intense pressure for exhibition of the materials so close collaboration
                    between all parties to gain as much scientific and cultural information about
                    the origins of the materials and the mummies was a unique component in ensuring
                    their longevity while on exhibit. This sharing of data aided the control of
                    exhibit conditions in South America and long-term management of the materials to
                    allow further studies. </p>
                <p class="noindent">The critical component in the generation of knowledge in these studies is
                    recognizing the importance of skilled people and work processes that efficiently
                    add value and meaning. In order to analyze the original source material, high
                    resolution spectral imaging creates the DCO, and data processing and further
                    scientific analyses revolve around the interactions of the people involved –
                    preservation scientist, curator, scholar and technology specialist. This
                    iterative process is reliant not only upon the effective use of technology to
                    assimilate process and disseminate the information with standardized processing,
                    metadata and data management, but also the quality of the collaborative
                    interaction between professionals from different fields. </p>
                <p class="noindent">While the relationship between the original and the DCO is provided through
                    metadata that maintains the spatial links between the scientific data, the
                    original material, and the new knowledge generated from these linkages, the
                    integration of diverse opinions and perspectives is an integral component of
                    this new knowledge generation. Standardization of file formats and structures
                    across these different fields provides a method of ensuring continued access and
                    integration to the information, by maintaining and creating effective
                    associations while generating new knowledge. The above examples illustrate the
                    requirement for this standardization of both scientific and scholarly files, to
                    enable true international collaboration and sharing of resources between
                    countries and disciplines. These protocols can support effective data exchange
                    with conventions that provide a local structure for a scientific data network.
                    This sustains diversity in scientific research and scholarly studies. This
                    requirement for a structural framework for cultural heritage institutions allows
                    both user access and functional usability of information to support
                    research.</p>
                <p class="noindent">Effective visualization of these data connections is essential for further
                    associations, with access to both spatial and temporal data for the maps,
                    textiles and other objects directly linked back to the original source material
                    through the DCO. Visualization tools and interfaces offer potential for open
                    dialogue between multidisciplinary fields and ease of navigation through layers
                    of data, since knowledge generation is reliant on the cohesive interaction and
                    collaboration between science and humanities researchers. The knowledge
                    representation and underlying interpretation system needs to be appropriate for
                    the application and the types of analyses that are needed for integrating and
                    expanding cultural heritage research. The development of <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-179.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#X" target="_top">XML</a>-based
                    knowledge representation languages and standards include the <a href="http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-179.xml&amp;chunk.id=&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework#X" target="_top">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF). A major benefit
                    of RDF is the ability to utilize the features that facilitate the merging of
                    data, even if the underlying schemas differ. The further advantage for this
                    heritage science application is the capacity to support the evolution of schemas
                    over time, allowing both structured and semi-structured data to be combined and
                    shared across different areas within the application. The large volumes of
                    digital data generated require a repository that can cope with a diverse range
                    of object types, as is true for with collections of data used for scientific
                    analyses. Data files from these objects include images, spectra, reports, and
                    other extant files, requiring additional metadata mechanisms to accommodate a
                    range of data, while retaining access and associations. An RDF model offers
                    greater flexibility and opportunity for integration across various disciplines,
                    since it is designed to accommodate multiple ontologies with a structured
                    approach. The model or ontology being exploited within this structure allows us
                    to coordinate a wide range of data and file types with extensive metadata and
                    multiple data formats. For example, metadata from the scientific instrument is
                    included so the measurement could be reproduced, and in addition the data can be
                    imported in multiple formats – as spectra for visual representation and as a
                    .csv standardized sharable data file. </p>

                <p class="noindent">Scriptospatial mapping of the textiles and maps involves an accurate coordinate
                    system that links scientific and scholarly analyses to the DCO, and allows
                    inferences to be drawn to generate new knowledge. This approach to viewing the
                    DCO in relation to multiple dimensions applies an essentially archeological
                    methodology toward uncovering and interconnecting information strata of cultural
                    heritage artifacts. Utilizing an object-oriented approach in conjunction with
                    the data layer allows the mapping of spatial and temporal data with increasing
                    complexity. Examining and explaining the physical, spectral and chemical
                    properties of the maps and textiles permit the humanities scholar to link these
                    scientific analyses to the social aspects of how they were created. These links
                    therefore create meaningful scientific outcomes of the content: When obscured or
                    faded text can be retrieved; inks and pigments characterized and traced to
                    specific geographical locations; analysis of the intensity of handwriting
                    imparts understanding of the author’s original intent; and the provenance and
                    source of paper is gleaned through the capture and analysis of the watermark in
                    the paper. </p>
                <p class="noindent">A continued focus on collaboration between people, data and processes is a major
                    factor in promoting access and integration of scientific and humanities
                    research, emphasizing the importance of linking the original artifact with
                    digital tools and techniques for visualizing and disseminating new knowledge in
                    the arts and humanities. Concentrating on generating new knowledge from content
                    derived from these maps, textiles and other objects enhances the importance of
                    the DCO. This allows improved access, interpretation and preservation of fragile
                    items of significant cultural heritage. However the extracted information is
                    only as important as the strength of the collaborative partnerships set up to
                    create a constant iterative loop for access to and interpretation of new
                    scholarly and scientific information. This requires a strong and committed
                    association between previously disparate fields to incorporate and share the
                    generation of new knowledge by mining additional data and forging new advances
                    in humanities research. These related but previously disparate disciplines
                    comprise humanities scholars, scientists, researchers, technology and data
                    management specialists to form an open yet interconnected digital exchange of
                    humanities research.</p>
