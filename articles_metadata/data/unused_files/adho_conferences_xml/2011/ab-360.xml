                    Stroupe, Craig, 
                    University of Minnesota Duluth, 
                    <a href="mailto:cstroupe@d.umn.edu">cstroupe@d.umn.edu</a>
                </h4><hr />
            
                <h2></h2>
                <p class="noindent">The series <i>You Suck at Photoshop</i> first appeared as a three-and-a-half-minute hoax
                    circulating on the web in late 2007—a one-off Internet meme satirizing
                    home-made, how-to videos ubiquitous on YouTube. Conceived and performed by
                    advertising professionals Troy Hitch and Matt Bledsoe, the video featured an
                    ironic, My-Last-Duchess-style commentary by a fictitious computer geek Donny
                    Holye, who unintentionally reveals messy details of his marital, legal, and
                    emotional life while demonstrating techniques of Photoshop. That same fall, in a
                    special issue of <i>PMLA</i> on “Remapping Genre,” some of the leading voices in the
                    emergent field of the digital humanities discuss the database as a cultural
                    form, and debate the political, ideological, and practical impact of databases
                    on the work of the humanities, and the practices of narrative in particular. The
                    varied contributions to “Remapping Genre” provide a dramatic tableau of
                    twenty-first-century academic humanities confronting the database as a cultural
                    discourse, and speculating on whether it represents an alien nemesis from the
                    world of corporate capitalism, the long-sought embodiment of implicit literary
                    ideals, or a value-neutral complement to narrative linearity. </p>
                <p class="noindent"> This presentation argues that “Remapping Genre” and <i>You Suck at Photoshop</i> not
                    only share an historical moment, but constitute a common critical effort to
                    understand and respond to the historical rise of databases in cultural practice.
                    Invoking this unlikely affiliation might seem to announce another scholarly
                    incursion on the popular realm under the pirate flag of Cultural Studies.  The
                    relationship suggested here between academic and popular cultures, however, is
                    less a territorial rivalry than a mutually transformational dialogue.  And, in
                    fact, this transformation is well underway.  On one hand, as contributors to
                    “Remapping Genre” amply document, literary studies is rapidly adopting
                    frictionless, digital tools to perform its daily work: from personal,
                    bibliographic browser plug-ins like Zotero, to online databases like The <i>Walt
                    Whitman Archive</i>, to vast digitalization initiatives like Google Books.  Less
                    recognized, on the other hand, is the degree to which popular, database-driven
                    New Media like Facebook, online games, and the web itself are increasingly being
                    constructed not only by the work of programmers and designers, but by narratives
                    that users, players, and an emerging circle of professional critics employ to
                    shape, remember, and publicize their experiences of virtual database
                    environments.  Such narratives reveal how the texture of language—the friction
                    of fiction—is an integral part of how databases are culturally constructed and
                    experienced, and the extent to which that use of narrative language is
                    conditioned by a literary sensibility. </p>
                <p class="noindent">This talk will analyze clips from <i>You Suck at Photoshop</i>—as well as background on
                    the series’ circulation and presentation on the web—to examine the interplay of
                    narrative and database as textual and cultural logics, as well as to suggest the
                    historical transformations that such an emergent dialogic is producing in the
                    relationship between the academic humanities and popular culture. Like Donny
                    Hoyle’s conflicted relationship with Photoshop’s remorselessly vast database of
                    tools, the Digital Humanists featured in “Remapping Genre” express ambivalent
                    responses to database-driven tools of their own academic trade, and debate Lev
                    Manovich’s claim that database and narrative are “natural enemies…[c]ompeting
                    for the same territory of human culture, each claim[ing] an exclusive right to
                    make meaning out of the world” (225). Ed Folsom’s and Kenneth Price’s digital
                    project The <i>Walt Whitman Archive</i> provides a common case in point, serving to
                    ground, historicize, and set in relief the critical differences among these
                    scholars, which echo concerns and anxieties within the profession at large:
                    questions concerning the degree to which databases may or may not threaten
                    narrative forms of thought and meaning (N. Katherine Hayles); the ideological,
                    as opposed to the supposedly libratory, effects of databases, especially
                    mediated by large, corporate interfaces like Google (Jonathan Freedman); the
                    extent to which the seemingly new logic of databases remediates pre-digital,
                    even ancient literacies (Peter Stallybrass and Meredith L. McGill); whether or
                    not the database can be called a genre, perhaps even belonging to the “epic”
                    genre that crosses national and historical boundaries (Wai Chee Dimock); and the
                    problems of deciding whether a tool like The <i>Walt Whitman Archive</i> is really a
                    database at all (Jerome McGann). </p>
                <p class="noindent">Beyond particular insights into the database/narrative question, this talk will
                    explore how the very unlikeliness of this dialogue of You Suck at Photoshop and
                    “Remapping Genre” points to emergent affinities and even alliances among
                    popular, academic, and economically “productive” discourses. If these potential
                    alliances have not been sufficiently described, it is not from lack of trying,
                    however. In his monumental book <i>The Laws of Cool</i>, for instance, literary critic
                    and digital theorist Alan Liu attempts to imagine the relationship between the
                    cultures of “the literary”— not just “works of literature as such,” he says, but
                    “the underlying sense of the literary”—and of digital “knowledge work”
                    characterized by an ethos of “cool” (1, 3). “In [capitalism’s] regime of
                    systematic innovation [and creative destruction],” he asks at the beginning of
                    the book, “is the very notion of the literary doomed to extinction if—or,
                    rather, especially if—it dares to imagine a literature of the database,
                    spreadsheet, report, and Web page?” (3). Essentially, Liu is questioning just
                    how “the contemporary humanities and arts…[might] not only make contact with the
                    generations of cool but lead them beyond the present limitations of cool” (381). </p>
                <p class="noindent">In his somber Epilogue, Liu declares, “I am a believer at heart…. I think
                    literature will indeed have a place in a new-media world…. But what the eventual
                    nature and position of that literature will be among the convergent data streams
                    of the future is something I do not yet know how to theorize” (389). Like
                    Richard Lanham, Katherine Hayles, and other scholars leading the search for the
                    Holy Grail of would-be database literature, Liu tends to look for examples in
                    high-cultural practices of Internet Art, or what he more inclusively terms
                    “ethical hacking,” but Liu ultimately finds them “too closely associated with
                    anarchist, Situationalist, radical leftist, and/or high-theoretical paradigms…to
                    offer persuasive models for an art that might affect the knowledge worker in his
                    or her ordinary cubicle” (397-98). This talk will argue that such persuasive
                    models, or perhaps <i>models</i> of models, can be found in the ordinary cubicles of
                    slackers like Donny Hoyle—but only if academic culture can develop the critical
                    idiom to describe them. </p>
