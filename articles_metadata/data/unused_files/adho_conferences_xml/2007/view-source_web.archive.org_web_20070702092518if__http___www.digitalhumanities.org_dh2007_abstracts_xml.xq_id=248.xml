                    among disciplines and research areas in &amp; around humanities. By
                    collecting papers from main journals in diverse areas like cognitive science,
                    art history and psychoanalysis, this study aims to build a small citation
                    network that will be visualized and published as a 3d web page. The end-map will
                    be the backbone of a dissertation, which tries to analyze the influence of
                    various movements and disciplines onto the art historical canon. Used as such, a
                    citation network can become more than a frozen map that has more than a one-time
                    use value.</p></div0><div0><p>Access to online electronic databases and tools such as Google scholar have led
                    to a significant improvement in the discovery of secondary literature. However,
                    organizing the vast amount of bibliographic information from various
                    discipline-specific databases continues to be an impediment to truly
                    interdisciplinary work. My project attempts to construct virtual maps of
                    electronic databases or digital libraries capable of providing scholars with
                    significant links between disciplinary relations, interdisciplinary research
                    areas, or tendencies, approaches and methodologies inside a single discipline.
                    Moreover, as I will show, if the third dimension, namely history, is added to
                    these maps, the transformation of the disciplines, the merging of research
                    areas, and the changes in the taxonomic structure of the academy will be
                    revealed to the expert eye. As an example of how such a virtual time-map could
                    become a valuable analytic tool during the research process, I will construct
                    such a tool and, using my dissertation as a test case, demonstrate how it can be
                    applied to map intersections between art historiography, psychoanalysis and
                    cognitive science.</p><p>As a PhD candidate in UCLA's Art History program, my dissertation traces the
                    changes of the critical discourse from the 1970s, when the so-called "New Art
                    History" clashed with traditional art historians, and gave rise to a whole new
                    approach—one that has now become known as Visual Cultural Studies. However, in
                    such a broad context, one needs to handle a deluge of texts and interrelations.
                    A simple timeline, a linear outline constituted of chapters and subchapters is
                    not enough to depict the map of overlapping layers, concepts and relations
                    between opposite but—in this case still—allied methodologies. In order to
                    render all these visible, I would like to create a multidimensional space of
                    such relations. To that end I propose to collect significant papers, extract
                    citation information using various text-analysis programs and visualize the end
                    results as a citation network that runs along three different trajectories,
                    namely the history of psychoanalytical and cognitive scientific methodologies
                    and their impact on the evolution of New Art History into Visual Cultural
                    Studies.</p></div0><div0><head>History:</head><p>A relatively new research venue, called ‘scientometrics’ or ‘bibliometrics’,
                    specializes in creating such maps for delineating growth, relations and
                    interactions in scientific fields.<note n="1">To read more on the history of

                    Bibliometrics uses text analysis to extract citation data from papers and makes
                    use of this data as a way of evaluating scientific publications. To obtain
                    information from scientific papers and using he results in mapping out
                    scientific relations has a long history. As early as 1964 Garfield and his
                    colleagues suggested using citation data to evaluate the development of
                        science.<note n="2"> All these search engines providing citation index
                        information are products of Thomson ISI. The original foundation was called
                        simply Institute for Scientific Information. Garfield launched it, again in
                        1964, see ibid.</note> From 80’s on, the research in this area accelerated
                    with the advancement of computers and various combinations of statistical
                    methods used to extract and evaluate information such as citations, co-
                    citations with reference of various bibliometric data. The end-results are
                    usually rendered as so-called ‘citation networks’ which are a variation of
                    social networks.<note n="3">Doreian Patrick, <title level="a">A Measure Of

                    evaluate a scholar or a journal according to how many times it/he/she is cited.
                    Moreover, there is so much research done using citation networks as a
                    methodology to analyze the disciplines, many scholars are now questioning the
                    efficacy of this approach.<note n="4">See R. E. Rice et al., <title level="a">Journal-To-Journal Citation Data,</title><title level="j"> Scientometrics</title> Vol. 15.3-4 (1989): 257-282; Lindsey

                    themselves: the citation networks are either built to support an idea or to
                    enhance the way in which such networks are composed. In the first instance, a
                    search is done to filter out unnecessary papers. The maps generated in this way
                    are limited with a scope, and generally give an overview of the research topic.
                    These maps are not created from a relational database and are not published for
                    further use. That means they are not applicable to other research questions and
                    the enormous work put into collecting papers and preparing them for network
                    analysis is done on a case-by-case basis because access to the databases is
                    restricted and therefore the datasets themselves cannot be made available. In
                    the second instance papers are extracted from the electronic database without
                    any filtering. Instead a time limit is imposed. These types of publications tend
                    to focus more on the technical details and explore the mathematical substructure
                    of social networks. Usually open-source databases are preferred, since the main
                    idea is to test the application’s performance on huge datasets. Papers about
                    such studies do not interpret the resulting map and instead detail the
                    mathematical innovation of the applications.</p><p>Despite the popularity of this approach in the sciences, I have yet to find a
                    paper that uses Humanities databases. Even the most comprehensive citation
                    network, a data set that encompasses "7,121 journals covering over 1 million
                    documents in the combined Science Citation and Social Science Citation Indexes”
                    does not delve into the Arts and Humanities Citation Index.<note n="5">Boyack,
                        Kevin W., Klavans Richard, Börner Katy,<title level="a"> Mapping The Backbone Of Science,</title><title level="j"> Scientometrics</title> 64.3 (2005): 351.374 </note> Rather
                    than simply applying the same techniques to Humanities materials, a fresh
                    approach, one that is not only suits to humanities scholarship, but addresses
                    some of the issues raised in the scientific communities seems desirable.<note n="6">Even though the end results of the “citation networks” give a scholar
                        a good overview, they are still not integrated into the academic research
                        facilities like Web of Science, Science Citation Index, Social Citation
                        Index or Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index etc. The main reason is
                        that once a citation network is derived, it becomes a static entity; it
                        covers a limited time and scope. Thus citation networks, by their very
                        definitions and aims, fail to keep up with new publications. </note>
                    Although my long-term goal is to create a dynamic citation network that can
                    become a part of an ongoing research project in digital humanities, in this
                    paper I will focus on creating a static citation network using open-source
                    tools. My research plan to achieve this aim is as follows: <list type="ordered"><item><emph rend="bold">Collecting papers:</emph> I have
                            already collected around 2000 papers, mostly from prominent journals in
                            Art History (such as Art Bulletin, October, Art Journal and Leonardo),
                            and in Cognitive Science (Trends in Cognitive Sciences). Beside these
                            resources I would like to include the classical texts in psychoanalysis;
                            which can be found in electronic format in the Psychoanalytic Electronic
                            Publishing database. The main criterion used for selecting pertinent
                            papers is to use keywords that are relevant for the research topic. For
                            example I used keywords such as "Freud", "psychoanalysis", "aesthetic",
                            "artist" while searching in a cognitive science journal whereas I chose
                            keywords like ‘cognition", "cognitive science", "vision", "artist" etc.
                            for the search in the domain of psychoanalysis. </item><item><emph rend="bold">Preprocessing the database for text
                                analysis &amp; extraction the needed information:</emph> The
                            acquired corpus is preprocessed for text mining and analysis. Preparing
                            a list of keywords and bibliometric data (author name, date, journal
                            name, title, etc.) will be enough for the preprocessing stage. We will
                            experiment with different text- mining and text analysis programs and
                            report on those that work well at this stage of data preparation. </item><item><emph rend="bold"> Construction of social
                            networks:</emph> A social network is a graph representation of social
                            relations. Graphs are the most popular and widely researched data
                            structure for representing and processing relational data. In a graph,
                            each node represents one entity (a person in a social network; a
                            researcher or a work in a citation network) and the edges (or arcs, if
                            they are directed) of the graph represent some relation. One can also
                            indicate the strength of the relation by associating weights with the
                            edges of the graph. Then, by using tools like Pajek<note n="7">You can find more information about Pajek, its history 
                                and application areas at <xptr to="http://vlado.fmf.uni-                                      lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/default.htm" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>, last accessed 2006-11-15.</note>, the graph nodes
                            can be placed in a 3D space in such a way to minimize an energy term.
                            Thus, the nodes that are close to each other semantically (through the
                            interpretation of graph edges) are placed in proximity, even when they
                            don't have actual links. On a social network, clusters and cliques can
                            be identified, indirect relations can be uncovered, and relevance
                            judgments can be made based on quantitative or qualitative measures.
                            Even the location of the nodes (center vs. periphery) can be informative
                            for a person thoroughly acquainted with the represented structure.
                        </item></list></p><p>The use of such a graph tool is simple; nodes and arcs are read from a file, and
                    the graph visualization is accomplished with a few commands. For a citation or
                    semantic network, text mining tools can be employed to derive the entities in
                    relation automatically. Once such a network is built, Pajek can import the graph
                    in 3D file formats like 3xd and VRML; both are now becoming standards for
                    internet publication in 3D.<note n="8">Please check <xptr to="http://www.w3.org/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/> to see the latest

                    main framework for my dissertation. By incorporating the 3D virtual map into my
                    dissertation, I hope to demonstrate a new form of digital scholarship--one that
                    springs from the new possibilities that digital technologies affords scholars in
                    the humanities whose work is inherently, and exuberantly, interdisciplinary.</p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
