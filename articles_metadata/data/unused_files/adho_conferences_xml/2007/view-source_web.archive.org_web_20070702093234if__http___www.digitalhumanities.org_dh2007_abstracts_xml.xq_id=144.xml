                    analysis of Internet Resources in the Arts and Humanities) project
                    (<xptr to="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slais/circah/lairah/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) which is based at UCL’s School of
                    Library Archive and Information Studies. It was a fifteen month study (reporting
                    in October 2006) to discover what influences the long-term sustainability and
                    use of digital resources in the humanities through the analysis and evaluation
                    of real-time use.</p><p>At Digital Humanities 2006 we reported on the early stages of the project, in
                    which we carried out deep log analysis of the AHDS and Humbul portals to
                    determine the level of use of digital resources. (Warwick et al. 2006) This
                    proposal will discuss the results of the final phase of the research in which we
                    examined digital resources from the point of view of those who designed and
                    built them. We aimed to discover whether there were common characteristics and
                    elements of good practice linking resources that are well- used.</p><p>Numerous studies have been carried out into the information needs and information
                    seeking practices of humanities scholars (Barrett, (2005) Talja and Maula
                    (2003), Herman (2001) and British Academy, (2005)). However, our research is
                    original because it surveys the practices of those who produce digital
                    humanities resources. We also based the selection of our projects on deep log
                    analysis: a quantitative technique which has not previously been applied to
                    digital humanities resources to ascertain real usage levels of online digital
                    resources.</p></div0><div0><head>Method:</head><p>We selected a sample of twenty one publicly funded projects with varying levels
                    of use, covering different subject disciplines, to be studied in greater depth.
                    We classified projects as well-used if the server log data from the Arts and
                    Humanities Data Service (AHDS) and Humbul portals showed that they had been
                    repeatedly and frequently accessed by a variety of users. We also mounted a
                    questionnaire on these sites and asked which digital resources respondents found
                    most useful. Although most nominated information resources, such as libraries,
                    archives and reference collections for example the eDNB, three UK publicly
                    funded research resources were mentioned, and thus we added them to the study.
                    We also asked representatives of each AHDS centre to specify which resources in
                    their collections they believed were most used. In the case of Sheffield
                    University the logs showed that a large number of digital projects accessed were
                    based at the Humanities Research Institute. We therefore conducted interviews
                    about the HRI and its role in fostering the creation of digital humanities
                    resources.</p><p>The selected projects were studied in detail, including any documentation and
                    reports that could be found on the project’s website. We also interviewed a
                    representative of the project, either the principal investigator or a research
                    assistant.</p></div0><div0><head>Results:</head><div1><head>Institutional context:</head><p>The majority of projects that we interviewed had been well supported in
                        technical terms, and this had undoubtedly aided the success of the project,
                        especially where it was associated with a centre of digital humanities
                        excellence such as the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Kings
                        College London or the HRI at Sheffield. Critical mass aided the spread of
                        good practice in the construction and use of digital resources in the
                        humanities. Where a university valued such activities highly they tended to
                        proliferate. More junior members of staff were inspired to undertake digital
                        humanities research by the success of senior colleagues and early adopters
                        respected for their traditional and digital research. Unfortunately such
                        critical mass is relatively rare in UK universities and some PIs reported
                        that their digital resource was not understood or valued by their
                        departments, and thus their success had not lead to further digital
                        research.</p></div1><div1><head>Staffing:</head><p>PIs also stressed how vital it had been to recruit the ideal RAs. These were
                        however relatively difficult to find, as they had to have both disciplinary
                        research expertise and good knowledge of digital techniques. Most RAs
                        therefore required training, which many PIs often found lacking or of poor
                        quality. A further frustration was the difficulty of finding funding to
                        continue research, this meant that an expert RA might leave, necessitating
                        further training of a new employee if the project was granted future
                        funding.</p></div1><div1><head>Dissemination:</head><p>The strongest correlation between well-used projects and a specific activity
                        was in the area of dissemination. In all the projects studied, staff had
                        made determined efforts to disseminate information as widely as possible.
                        This was a new challenge for many humanities academics, who were more used
                        to writing books, marketed by their publishers. This might include giving
                        papers at seminars and conferences both within the subject community and the
                        digital humanities domain; sending out printed material; running workshops,
                        and in the most unusual instance, the production of a tea-towel!</p></div1><div1><head>User contact:</head><p>Very few projects maintained contact with their users or undertook any
                        organised user testing, and many did not have a clear idea how popular the
                        resource was or what users were doing with it. However, one of the few
                        projects that had been obliged to undertake user surveys by its funders was
                        very well-used, and its PI had been delighted at the unexpected amount and
                        range of its use. Another project came to the belated realisation that if it
                        had consulted users the process of designing the resource would have been
                        simpler and less demanding.</p></div1><div1><head>Documentation:</head><p>Few of the projects kept organised documentation, with the exception of those
                        in archaeology, linguistics and archival studies, where such a practice is
                        the norm in all research. Most projects had kept only fragmentary, internal
                        documents, many of which would not be comprehensible to someone from
                        outside. Documentation could also be difficult to access, with only a small
                        minority of projects making this information available from its website.
                        This is an important omission since documentation aids reuse of resources,
                        and also provides vital contextual information amount its contents and the
                        rationale for its construction that users need to reassure them about the
                        quality of the resource for academic research.</p></div1><div1><head>Sustainability:</head><p>Another area of concern was the issue of sustainability. Although the
                        resources were offered for deposit with the AHDS, few PIs were aware that to
                        remain usable, both the web interface and the contents of the resource would
                        require regular updating and maintenance, since users tend to distrust a web
                        page that looks outdated. Yet in most cases no resources were available to
                        perform such maintenance, and we learnt of one ten year old resource whose
                        functionality had already been significantly degraded as a result.</p></div1></div0><div0><head>Conclusion and recommendations</head><p>Well-used projects do therefore share common features that predispose them to
                    success. The effect of institutional and disciplinary culture in the
                    construction of digital humanities projects was significant. We found that
                    critical mass was vital, as was prestige within a university or the acceptance
                    of digital methods in a subject. The importance of good project staff and the
                    availability of technical support also proved vital. If a project as to be
                    well-used it was also essential that information about it should be disseminated
                    as widely as possible.</p><p>Even amongst well-used projects, however we found areas that might be improved,
                    these included organised user testing, the provision of and easy access to
                    documentation and the lack of updating and maintenance of many resources.</p><div1><head>Recommendations:</head><div2><head>Documentation:</head><list type="unordered"><item>Projects should keep documentation and make it available from the
                                project web site, making clear the extent, provenance and selection
                                methods of materials for the resource.</item><item>Funding bodies might consider making documentation a compulsory
                                deliverable of a funded project.</item><item>Discussions could be held between relevant stakeholders and the
                                funding bodies, with the aim of producing an agreed documentation
                                template. This should specify what should be documented and to what
                                level of detail.</item></list></div2><div2><head>Users:</head><list type="unordered"><item>Projects should have a clear idea of whom the expected users might
                                be; consult them as soon as possible and maintain contact through
                                the project via a dedicated email list , website feedback or other
                                appropriate method</item><item>They should carry out formal user surveys, software and interface
                                tests and integrate the results into project design.</item><item>Applicants for funding should show that they have consulted
                                documentation of other relevant projects and discuss what they have
                                learnt from it in their case for support. The results of such
                                contact could then be included in the final report as a condition of
                                satisfactory progress.</item></list></div2><div2><head>Management:</head><list type="unordered"><item>Projects should have access to good technical support, ideally
                                from a centre of excellence in digital humanities.</item><item>Projects should recruit staff who have both subject expertise and
                                knowledge of digital humanities techniques, then train them in other
                                specialist techniques as necessary.</item><item>Funding bodies might consider requiring universities to offer more
                                training for graduate students and RAs in digital humanities
                                techniques.</item></list></div2><div2><head>Sustainability:</head><list type="unordered"><item>Ideally projects should maintain and actively update the
                                interface, content and functionality of the resource, and not simply
                                archive it with a data archive such as the AHDS. However this is
                                dependent on a funding model which makes this possible.</item></list></div2><div2><head>Dissemination:</head><list type="unordered"><item>Disseminate information about itself widely, both within its own
                                subject domain and in digital humanities.</item><item>Information should be disseminated widely about the reasons for
                                user testing and its benefits, for example via AHRC/AHDS workshops.
                                Projects should be encouraged to collaborate with experts on user
