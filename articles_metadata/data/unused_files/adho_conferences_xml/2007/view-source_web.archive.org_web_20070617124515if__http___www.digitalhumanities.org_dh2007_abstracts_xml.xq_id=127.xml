                    Universities (2002), calls for a “dramatic reorganization of undergraduate
                    education” to address the challenges faced by higher education in a time of
                    transformation from an industrial to a knowledge-based society (vii). The report
                    states that “education practices invented when education served only the few are
                    increasingly disconnected from the needs of contemporary students”(viii) and the
                    demands of citizens of a diverse and interconnected world.</p><p>The Report recommends an invigorated and practical liberal education offering
                    knowledge that all students, regardless of backgrounds, fields, or chosen higher
                    education institutions, should acquire. The college student of the twenty-first
                    century needs to become an “intentional learner” who can thrive in a complex
                    world, and who can adapt to new environments, integrate knowledge from different
                    sources, and transform information into knowledge and knowledge into judgment
                    and action (xi.). The Report urges an “end to the traditional, artificial
                    distinctions between liberal and practical education” and advocates a kind of
                    instruction and learning that looks beyond the classroom to the world’s major
                    questions” (xii).</p><p>The changing nature of colleges and universities and the reconstruction of
                    education it calls for is in great part conditioned by what Douglas Kellner
                    calls the “Great Transformation,” powered by one of the most dramatic
                    technological revolutions in history (2003, 51). The revisioning of higher
                    education is increasingly seen in correlation with the development of digital
                    technologies, which are changing not only traditional models of work, leisure
                    and communication, but also the nature of knowledge itself, as well as models of
                    acquiring and processing information cognitively. In the Report it is asserted
                    that the “intellectual and practical skills that students need are extensive,
                    sophisticated and expanding with the explosion of new technologies” (xi). Like
                    the AACU Report, Kellner too argues that traditional and specialized aspects of
                    education need to be overcome in order to develop alternative pedagogies and
                    multiple “literacies” to meet the challenges of an interconnected global
                    society. The study of interrelationships, connectivity, transfer, and
                    integration, leading to the development of critical judgment, is proposed as the
                    basis of the new liberal curriculum in all disciplines of the humanities.</p><p>The five key concepts for the new curriculum are in fact not so much concepts as
                    they are markers of cognitive processes. As such, the reform of higher education
                    is to take place primarily in terms of methodology of teaching. Given that
                    “hypertext is a mental process, as well as a digital tool” (Gilster, 137), and
                    the WWW is “an embodiment of human knowledge”(W3C), exploring the relationships
                    between cognition and technology in the context of the new humanities and
                    pedagogy can be useful. I would like to suggest that the digital media offer a
                    useful concrete, but also a cognitive tool for teaching the five processes that
                    are to be the core of the new humanities. This claim has theoretical and
                    practical implications. Theoretically, it calls for becoming more aware how the
                    computer is altering our ways of engaging with specific disciplinary questions
                    cognitively and methodologically (McCarty, 1). My concerns in this paper,
                    however, have to do with the practical applications of the impact of digital
                    media on cognition within the area of the humanities. Practically, the claim
                    calls for explicit instruction within the context of each discipline in the
                    methods of organization and manipulability that underlie the presentation of
                    material on the WWW.</p><p>The main vehicle of the digital media, the WWW, in its nature embodies,
                    illustrates and enables through its functioning all four of the processes
                    suggested as the basis for the new liberal curriculum--interrelationships,
                    connectivity, transfer, and integration. By their very nature “the new media
                    technologies externalize and objectify reasoning” (Manovich, 59). The WWW
                    resists attempts at standard systematization, and demonstrates the co-existence
                    of and interrelationships between multiple and apparently contradictory
                    perspectives on a single issue. One GOOGLE keyword search will retrieve hundreds
                    of documents linked by one single term, but applied variously in different
                    contexts, emphasizing the importance and nature of connectivity, transfer and
                    integration.</p><p>In relation to a given subject of inquiry or task, the non-linearity in the
                    presentation of material and ideas on the WWW encourages “intentional”
                    involvement on the part of learners, as there is no longer one “solution” or a
                    single “interpretation,” but a variety, all situated within their own context
                    and knowledge. In order to find solutions to given questions or problems,
                    learners have to engage in a process of discovering connections among apparently
                    disparate materials and contexts, then find ways of transferring and integrating
                    parts of materials into a new context. The WWW also offers alternative models of
                    grouping materials, such as scaffolding, and it promotes the idea that
                    conceptual knowledge cannot be separated from the contexts in which it is
                    represented (Wiles and Littlejohn, 2003; Campbell, 2004; Cole, 2000; Carr,
                    1998;). The ready availability of various information on the WWW turns research
                    and interpretation not so much into an exercise that depends upon finding
                    information, but one that strongly emphasizes cognitive operations depending on
                    critical thinking: classification of it (finding meaningful interrelationships)
                    and making use of it (transferring it) by arranging it meaningfully in a give
                    context (integrating it). Scholarship and instruction in the humanities has
                    always relied on these processes; however, with computer connectivity and the
                    speed with which these processes happen, the WWW amplifies them, enables them
                    “physically” and “on-demand” and thus makes them more explicitly and
                    self-consciously “teachable” than before.</p><p>In addition, because the WWW offers multiple presentations of information, it
                    illustrates that knowledge and heuristics are not absolute, but situated within
                    various communities of knowing. Conceptually there is no “closure” or “ending”
                    online, but rather a constant process of evaluation of materials (Rhodes and
                    Sawday, 12) that are open to revisions, additions and remodeling. Becoming aware
                    of the implications the nature of the WWW has for understanding what constitutes
                    knowledge, argument, opinion, analysis and interpretation, leads to the
                    development of critical discernment, evaluative capacity and judgment.</p><p>While traditional “mass education tended to see life in a linear fashion based on
                    print models and developed pedagogies which broke experience into discrete
                    moments and behavioral bits,” a new critical pedagogy of the digital humanities
                    could produce skills that “enable individuals to better navigate the multiple
                    realm and challenges of contemporary life” (Kellner, 9). Making the WWW, its
                    capabilities and operating functions explicit models of intentional learning can
                    help educators in the digital humanities illustrate how knowledge in the
                    humanities is positively affected by the digital medium, and how the new
                    pedagogy leads to learning as an active, social process bound up with experience
                    connected with wider socio-political paradigms of change.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><monogr><author><name reg="Campbell, Kathy">Kathy Campbell</name></author><title level="m">E-ffective Writing for E-Learning Environments</title><imprint><pubPlace>Hershey, PA</pubPlace><publisher>Information Science Publishing</publisher><date value="2004">2004</date></imprint></monogr></biblStruct><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Carr, Kevin Michael">Kevin Michael Carr</name></author><title level="u">Reflective Judgment and Cognitive Interaction in an
