                    creating digital representations of their artifacts and collections at an
                    astounding rate (Institute of Museum and Library Services, 2005). The potential
                    of increased access to digital collections has tremendous implications for
                    digital humanities researchers, and many recent projects have focused on the
                    technical mechanics of digitizing cultural heritage resources. While these
                    considerations are extremely worthwhile, there is an equally important need to
                    explore how people use these digital resources once they become available
                    (Cameron, 2003; Knell, 2003).</p><p>This paper explores the role digital museum resources play in the lives of the
                    users of those resources. It presents results from an international survey
                    (administered to nearly 1500 visitors at nine different online museums) that
                    addressed the relationship between digital and physical museum resources in the
                    lives of museum visitors. The survey questions focused on how museum
                    professionals can encourage their visitors to form lifelong relationships with
                    museums: visiting in person when they can, and visiting online when they cannot.
                    The results of the survey help museum researchers and professionals understand
                    the complementary, cyclical relationship that exists between digital and
                    physical museums from a user-centered perspective.</p><p>A growing number of researchers are interested in studying how the many different
                    users of museum resources (museum visitors and professionals, information
                    providers and consumers) employ digital museum resources in their everyday lives
                    (White, 2004). Museum professionals today work in a changing environment where
                    information resources are becoming more technically-complex, and where the users
                    of those resources are becoming more information-savvy. Over the past decade,
                    the needs and expectations of museum visitors have become increasingly
                    sophisticated, and museum professionals are increasingly concerned with ensuring
                    that the right information resources are available to all users, inside and
                    outside the museum (Marty, Rayward &amp;Twidale, 2003).</p><p>To meet the changing needs of their visitors, museum professionals have
                    dramatically changed the way museum visitors interact with museum resources.
                    Increased access to digital collections has removed many traditional barriers
                    between museums and their visitors, offering new opportunities for interacting
                    with collections and information resources. Douma and Henchman (2000), for
                    example, discuss an online exhibit that allows visitors to digitally “strip
                    away” layers of a painting (Bellini’s Feast of the Gods), examining earlier
                    versions using simulated infrared or x-ray lenses. Gillard (2002) explores how
                    the National Museum of American History’s HistoryWired project encourages
                    visitors to manipulate a collection of artifacts, uncovering connections between
                    objects along temporal, cultural, and thematic lines.</p><p>These changes have led museum professionals to express concerns about the impact
                    new information technologies have on the relationship between museums and their
                    visitors. Some worry whether providing online access to digital museum resources
                    will result in a decrease in visits to physical museums and a corresponding loss
                    of financial revenue (Haley-Goldman &amp; Wadman, 2002). In the process of
                    providing access to digital museum resources, someone usually asks, “if visitors
                    can access these resources over the Internet, will they still come to the
                    museum?” The simple answer to this question is “yes, they will,” and a number of
                    recent surveys have shown that online visitors are also physical visitors
                    (Kravchyna &amp; Hastings, 2002). This makes sense; nobody asks, “if people
                    can look at pictures of beaches online, will they still vacation in Florida?”
                    Similarly, the ability to access digital museum resources online should in
                    theory serve as a lure, encouraging potential visitors to come to the physical
                    museum.</p><p>Despite this commonsense approach, worries about the relationship between
                    physical and digital museum resources persist. Why? The truth is that these
                    worries have far less to do with financial remuneration than with understanding
                    how the users of digital museum resources perceive the integration of those
                    resources into the sociocultural fabric of their everyday lives. To understand
                    the relationship between digital and physical museums, one must ask, “what role
                    do digital museum resources play in the life of the user of digital museums?”
                    Framing the question in this manner reflects a shift in perspective away from
                    the “user in the life of the museum” to the “museum in the life of the user”—a
                    shift that parallels one that has taken place in the library and information
                    science community over the past few decades.</p><p>Very little is known about why users seek digital museum resources or how users
                    integrate digital museum resources into their everyday lives, despite valuable
                    studies that have explored what visitors do at museum websites (Thomas &amp;
                    Carey, 2005). Understanding the relationship between digital museums and their
                    users becomes critically important as more museums offer digital resources
                    online, and the number of visitors to online museums increases to be five to ten
                    times the number of visito.rs to physical museums. If one wants to encourage a
                    situation where visitors make museums part of their everyday lives and feel
                    connected to museums whether they are physically there or not, there is a need
                    to explore the digital museum in the life of the user.</p><p>To meet this need, this study explored the following research questions: <list type="unordered"><item>What is the role of the digital museum in the life of the museum
                            visitor?</item><item>How can museums use museum websites to build stronger relationships
                            with their visitors, before and after a museum visit?</item><item>What needs do digital museum resources meet for museum users outside
                            the museum?</item><item>When and how do people use museum websites before and after visiting
                            museums?</item><item>What do visitors prefer to do on museum websites vs. in the museum,
                            and vice versa?</item><item>How do museum websites influence the visitors’ desire to visit the
                            museum?</item></list></p><p>To answer these questions, the researcher developed an online survey that asked
                    online museum visitors about their use of digital museum resources before and
                    after museum visits, and how they integrate digital and physical museum
                    resources in their everyday lives. The survey was advertised on the websites of
                    nine different museums, including the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the
                    Science Museum of Minnesota, the Australia War Memorial Museum, the Victoria and
                    Albert Museum, and the National Museum of Wildlife Art. From October 2005 to
                    October 2006, 1464 online visitors responded to the survey.</p><p>The survey results provide valuable insights into the behavior of visitors to
                    online museums around the world. Certain key findings from the study are
                    summarized in the following list: <list type="unordered"><item>Online museum visitors consider it very important for museums to have
                            a website.</item><item>They are very likely to visit a museum’s website before visiting the
                            museum.</item><item>They are likely to use a museum’s website to determine whether they
                            want to visit the museum.</item><item>They have strong preferences for what they want to do in the museum
                            vs. what they want to do using the museum’s website.</item><item>They are likely to visit the museum’s website after visiting a museum.</item><item>After leaving a museum, they expect to be able to find the museum’s
                            website easily, and they rely on the museum’s website to answer
                            questions about the museum.</item><item>They are likely to establish a relationship where they visit a museum
                            and its website repeatedly, visiting the museum when they can, and its
                            website when they cannot.</item><item>They are likely to visit museum websites in their daily life,
                            independent of planning or returning from a museum visit.</item></list></p><p>These results indicate that online museum visitors view museums and museum
                    websites as complementary, and that digital museum resources are not likely to
                    replace physical museum resources in the lives of museum visitors. The users of
                    digital museums are constructing, mostly on their own initiative, a complicated
                    relationship between digital and physical museum resources in their own lives.
                    By focusing solely on the user in the life of the museum, one sees only how
                    visitors use resources there, not how they make use of all museum resources,
                    digital and physical, in the museum and online, in their own lives. Studies of
                    the digital museum in the life of the user, therefore, are more likely to paint
                    an actual picture of the complex interactions the users of museum resources
                    experience at the boundary of physical and digital museums.</p><p>This study explores the broader implications of access to digital culture by
                    addressing the relationship between physical museum objects and digital
                    information resources. Much of the world’s cultural resources are located in
                    small museums, historical societies, and community heritage
                    associations—organizations that are just now digitizing their collections.
                    Without a solid understanding of how people use digital museum resources in
                    their everyday lives, what good does it do those institutions to create those
                    same resources? If one is to create a sustainable future for the digital
                    humanities, one must improve the overall understanding of how individuals use
                    digital information resources in ways that augment their appreciation and
                    understanding of physical artifacts and cultural heritage worldwide.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Cameron, F">F.
