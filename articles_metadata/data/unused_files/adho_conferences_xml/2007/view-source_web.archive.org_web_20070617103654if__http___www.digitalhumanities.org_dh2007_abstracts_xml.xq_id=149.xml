                    self-representation, touching on many of the most contentious issues in American
                    history since Emancipation—such as migration, exploitation, interracial
                    unity, racial violence, and civil rights activism (Hill 2003). Alexander Street
                    Press (ASP), in collaboration with the ARTFL Project, has developed an
                    extensively tagged database of over 1,200 plays containing 13.3 million words by
                    Black playwrights, from the middle of the 19th century to the present, including
                    many previously unpublished works. Like other ASP datasets, the Black Drama
                    database is remarkable for its detailed encoding and amount of metadata
                    associated with authors, titles, acts/scenes, performances, and characters. Of
                    particular interest for this study are the data available for authors and
                    characters which are stored as "stand-off mark-up" data tables. The character
                    table, for example, contains some 13,360 records with some 30 fields including
                    name(s), race, age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, occupation, sexual orientation, performers, if a real person, and type. More extensive information
                    is available for authors and titles. The character data are joined to each
                    character speech, giving 562,000 objects that can be queried by the full range
                    of character attributes. The ARTFL search system, PhiloLogic, allows for joining
                    of object attribute searches, forming a matrix of author/title/character
                    searching. For example, one can search for words in speeches by female, black,
                    American characters depicted by male, non-American authors in comedies first
                    published during the first half of the 20th century.</p><p>While user-initiated full-text searches on such author and character attributes
                    can help answer specific questions, we believe that advanced text data mining
                    systems have the potential to reveal important new patterns of variation in
                    general language use, broken down by various combinations of author and
                    character attributes. Initial work on racial epithets in this collection has
                    revealed striking differences in the use of such language between male and
                    female authors and characters, as well as American and non-American authors.
                    While illustrative, such micro-studies can do no more than hint at larger
                    discursive and representation issues that we believe can be identified by text
                    mining techniques. Prior studies using text mining for analyzing variation in
                    language use among different classes of authors have succeeded in identifying
                    meaningful linguistic features distinguishing author gender, age, and
                    personality type (e.g. Argamon et al. 2003, Koppel et al. 2002).</p><p>As might be expected of a collection of a particular class of literary texts,
                    the Black Drama database cannot be considered a "random" sample. The database
                    contains 963 works by 128 male playwrights and 243 pieces by 53 female
                    playwrights. Plays by Americans dominate the collection (831 titles), with the
                    remaining 375 titles representing the works of African and Caribbean authors.
                    The database contains 317,000 speeches by 8,392 male characters and 192,000
                    speeches by 4,162 female characters. There are 336,000 speeches by 7,067 black
                    characters and 55,000 by 1,834 white characters with a smattering of speeches by
                    other racial groups. As would be expected, the predominance of American authors
                    is reflected in the nationalities of speakers in the plays, with 272,000
                    speeches, compared with 71,000 by speakers represented as coming from a variety
                    of African nations.</p><p>Using these data, we are examining the degree to which machine learning can
                    isolate stylistic or content characteristics of authors and/or characters having
                    particular attributes—gender, race, and nationality—and the degree to
                    which pairs of author/character attributes interact. The first step to discover
                    if lexical style- or content-markers can be found which can be used to reliably
                    distinguish plays or speeches broken down by a particular characteristic, such
                    as gender of character. A positive result would constitute strong evidence for
                    distinctive, in this case, male and female, character voices in the sample of
                    plays. If distinctiveness can be shown, we then seek some 'characterization' of
                    the differences found, in terms of well-defined grammatical or semantic classes.
                    The experimental protocol which we have been developing for this purpose, as
                    applied by, e.g., Argamon et al. (2003), addresses both goals using techniques
                    from machine learning, supplemented by more traditional computer-assisted text
                    analysis.</p><p>First, to analyze a corpus of texts for distinctiveness, we need to determine if
                    effective predictive models can be learned from the texts, which accurately
                    classify new texts (that the system has not seen). The standard technique of
                    10-fold cross-validation can be used to estimate the usefulness of a learning
                    method for constructing models that work for 'out-of-sample' data. The corpus is
                    divided into 10 random subsets, and training is repeated for each of the 10 sets
                    of 9 of those subsets, with accuracy of the resulting model is measures on the
                    remaining subset. The average of these 10 numbers then forms a reasonably good
                    estimate of how a model learned on the entire corpus would perform for new data.
                    If this cross-validation accuracy is high (at least 70% for 50-50 balanced
                    data), we may conclude that the two classes of texts in the corpus are
                    linguistically 'distinctive'.</p><p>Second, to characterize the difference found (if any), all textual features
                    extracted (frequencies of lexemes, lemmas, parts-of-speech, etc.) are ranked by
                    some measure of how each of them enables prediction of a text's correct class.
                    One such measure is to use feature weights computed during learning (for SVM or
                    Naive Bayes learners, which compute such weights). Features with high weights
                    (positive or negative) are the most influential in classifying a text as one
                    class or the other (dependent on the sign of the weight). While a direct measure
                    of influence, these weights can be difficult to interpret since the effect of a
                    feature must be considered in the context of all the other features influencing
                    classification. Another approach is to use a function that measures the
                    'distinguishability' of a feature without regard to other features, such as
                    information gain or binormal separation (Forman et al. 2003). The downside here
                    is that some features may be of little use alone, but in conjunction with others
                    may have great discriminating power. In the current study we will be examining
                    the usefulness of multiple measures of both types, and see which approach proves
                    to be the more useful.</p><p>We conducted preliminary tests using the SVM-Light system (Joachims 1999) with
                    PGPDT (Zanghirati 2004, Zanni 2006) to build the models. We extracted all
                    speeches with character gender attributes from the corpus, splitting them into
                    tokenized word frequency vectors for all authors, all characters, male authors,
                    female authors, male characters, and female characters. For each of these, PGPDT
                    built a model to identify authors and characters by gender.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_149_olsen_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Table One</figDesc></figure><p>As indicated in Table One, the system the system correctly identified 88.2% of
                    the authors' gender and 77.4% of the speakers' gender. Performance varied when
                    examining subsets of the corpus, from 86.6% for gender of author in male
                    characters to 69.7% for gender of speaker in female authors. All of these
                    indicators show significant differences in words used by male and female authors
                    and speakers. The differences in accuracy in male and female author/character
                    may, however, result from the fact that male authors tend to include fewer
                    female characters and that the have fewer words as well as having fewer female
                    authors in the sample. This is shown in the Majority row of Table One, which
                    indicates the rate of male instances for each assessment. For female authors,
                    male characters constitute 54.5% of the speakers.</p><p>We then equalized a test sample for class by discarding instances until we have
                    a balanced set with an attempt to correct for word frequencies as well. As shown
                    in Table Two, author and character gender can be discriminated well.  Furthermore, we see that identification of author gender is consistently more
                    accurate than gender of speaker.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_149_olsen_2.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Table Two</figDesc></figure><p>As shown in Table 3, male authors/speakers are correctly somewhat more often in
                    five of the six cases, with the sole exception of almost exactly the same
                    correct identification of speaker gender in female authors.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_149_olsen_3.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Table Three</figDesc></figure><p>These results suggest that female lexical choices, both used by authors and
                    depicted in characters, are somewhat less marked (or more varied) than male use
                    of language. The full paper will explore this phenomenon in greater detail.
                    While the accuracy of identification of gender in significant in all the cases
                    we example, we expect that using some sort of feature set selection, as in, for
                    example, Hota, Argamon, and Chung (2006), will improve the precision of the
                    identification.</p><p>From this preliminary analysis, it would appear that the authorial gender is
                    rather more readily identified than the represented gender in characters.
                    Initial examination of the features that best predict gender of character, as
                    identified by information gain, range from the expected (male characters speak
                    of wives and swear more frequently), to the somewhat opaque, such as the words
                    'nonsense' and 'reason' being strongly male associated. It is also important to
                    note that both strongly male and female character terms in this sample are used
                    at about the same rates (per 10000 words) by male and female authors. This
                    suggests that male and female authors are able to use certain linguistic gender
                    markers effectively. As noted, it is significant that the machine learning
                    algorithms employed are less accurate in most cases in identifying female as
                    opposed to male authors and speakers.</p><p>The final paper will report results using similar techniques to examine the the
                    degree to which additional character attributes -- race and nationality -- can
                    be distinguished and, if this proves to be effective, examine the most important
                    features distinguishing between the language of white and black speakers and
                    American/non-American speakers. An initial examination of racial slurs in this
                    dataset suggests that speaker race and nationality may also be readily
                    identified.</p><p>As we have seen, machine learning and text mining techniques can support higher
                    orders of generalization and characterization than the more traditional
                    user-driven search methods widely used in computer-aided textual research. This
                    approach is most effective when used in relatively constrained experiments where
                    classification criteria are clearly defined, such as the social attributes of
                    authors and their characters. Some results may be trivial on a literary level—
                    of course men talk more of wives and only women tend to call other women hussies
                    —but such common sense results allow us to argue that the technique gives
                    meaningful results, and so odd results should be examined further, using more
                    traditional systems like PhiloLogic. We therefore argue that approaching the
                    interpretative process starting with highly structured and constrained
                    experimental hypotheses, we can take advantage of machine learning methods to
                    find new and unexpected foci for examining literary questions, which may in turn
                    shed new light on critical issues such as race and gender.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Argamon, Shlomo">Shlomo Argamon</name></author><author><name reg="Koppel, Moshe">Moshe Koppel</name></author><author><name reg="Fine, Jonathan">Jonathan Fine</name></author><author><name reg="Shimoni, Anat Rachel">Anat Rachel Shimoni</name></author><title level="a">Gender, Genre, and Writing Style in Formal Written
