                    increasingly audible in the spheres of digital humanities and humanities
                    computing, the necessity to build strong ties between digital humanities and
                    digital libraries only intensifies. Howard Besser, in his essay, The Past,
                    Present, and Future of Digital Libraries,” underscores the connections between
                    these two fields. He explains digital libraries not only “provide access to
                    original source material, contextualization, and commentaries, but they also
                    provide a set of additional resources and service”.<note n="1">From Besser’s
                        essay, “The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Libraries” in <title level="m"> A Companion to Digital Humanities</title>, 2004, p.
                    557.</note> Besser then delineates some of these resources and services,
                    including digital collections of traditional print materials, lexical analysis,
                    and increased accessibility. In addition to these important contributions to
                    humanities research, I would like to highlight the emerging role libraries play
                    in processing, preserving, maintaining, and providing access to important
                    archives that house born-digital content. This role will not only contribute to
                    humanities research in decades to come, but will also impact how research is
                    performed by directing what content is made available and how researches may
                    access it.</p><p>In this paper, I will examine the Emory University Libraries’ acquisition and
                    processing of a singular personal archive as a case study to explore the methods
                    and practices of handling born-digital archival materials and the implications
                    such methodologies and their outcomes may have on humanities research.</p><p>Emory University’s acquisition of Salman Rushdie’s personal archive represents an
                    important addition to the Manuscript and Rare Books Library, and contributes
                    significantly to the University’s digital library resources and research.
                    Rushdie’s rich personal archive includes traditional manuscript materials such
                    as journals, personal correspondence, and notebooks, as well as less traditional
                    archival materials, namely a series of personal computers that cover a
                    significant span in his personal and literary life. This digital archive
                    includes five computers, one early Macintosh desktop and four Macintosh laptops,
                    including both obsolete and current models. While MARBL has previously acquired
                    collections containing some digital materials, Rushdie’s computers represent the
                    first significant, sizeable digital component to the University’s extensive
                    holdings of rare and unique materials.</p><p>Such an acquisition requires archivists to engage with technologists to ensure
                    that the library can most effectively serve current and future researchers and
                    scholars. The curation of such an archive raises important questions about how
                    libraries should process, index, and present these materials while
                    simultaneously addressing preservation and authenticity concerns. Such questions
                    include: What is the research value of such an archive? How important is the
                    physical artifact? Do researchers need access to exact systems emulation? Is
                    providing search and browse access to the data sufficient or will researchers be
                    interested in Rushdie’s original directory structure? Once data is migrated from
                    the original environments, do we continue to maintain those outdated systems?
                    How do archives sustain both master and access instances of born-digital
                    archives?</p><p>As digital librarians and archivists at Emory begin processing the born-digital
                    components of this important archive, they must keep these questions, and the
                    host of secondary concerns circulating around them, in the foreground of
                    workflow and process discussions. In this paper, I will argue for the importance
                    of balancing the urgent needs of data and system stabilization with the more
                    long-term challenges of considering the ideal outcomes and products of
                    processing and providing access to a rare and unique born-digital archive. This
                    talk will track the early stages of processing the physical and digital
                    materials comprising Rushdie’s digital archive, outline approaches to handling
                    the more complex processing requirements, discuss proposed approaches to
                    presenting the archive to both local and distant researchers, and generalize
                    observations drawn from the experiences with this born-digital archive to
                    broader implications within digital libraries, digital curation, and humanities
                    computing.</p><p>With the acquisition of any archive, a research library takes on multiple
                    responsibilities to preserve, index, and provide access to the rare and unique
                    materials. Libraries—digital, brick and mortar, or otherwise—must “incorporate
                    the component of stewardship over a collection.”<note n="2">Besser, p.
                    559.</note> Such stewardship carries with it important responsibilities,
                    especially in cases of archival materials. Thus, with the arrival of the first
                    shipment of Rushdie’s digital archive, consisting of three out of the five
                    computers, our library and archive staff faced both immediate preservation
                    demands and distant challenges for archival curation. We elected to produce a
                    workflow that is both staged and modular, which I will only summarize here. The
                    first task is to provide a secure and stable environment for the machines
                    themselves. As our archives had not previously included technological artifacts,
                    this first step required some intensive space and environment analysis. Once we
                    stabilized the physical objects, this born digital archive next challenged staff
                    with questions of data recovery, data preservation, and data duplication. Such
                    challenges prompted us to develop a partitioned data architecture that
                    duplicates and preserves all master data. The original is preserved, a master
                    duplicate is generated and stored darkly, a duplicate collection of the master
                    database is housed in a secure repository for in-house processing and staging,
                    and, finally, a fully-processed instance of the data is made available through a
                    production database. Such an approach provides for preservation of original
                    artifacts and master data, while ensuring a level of security for data while it
                    is being processed for embargoed material.</p><p>In addition to preservation and security, authenticity of the archived data is of
                    particular importance to archivists, digital librarians, and humanities
                    researchers. Graham Barwell’s discussions about originality and authenticity
                    within the fields of textual studies and electronic textuality resonate with
                    archives such as Rushdie’s born-digital materials.<note n="3">Graham Barwell,
                        “Original, Authentic, Copy: Conceptual Issues in Digital Texts” in <title level="j"> Literary &amp; Linguistic Computing</title> 20.4 (1995)
                        see pages 416, 418, and 419.</note> How can we most authentically represent
                    the digital archives included in the Rushdie collection? Is the data the only
                    component of real research value or is the context that holds this data, the
                    paratextual elements, if you will, of equal importance to researchers? I will
                    explore these questions and provide illustrations from our processing of the
                    Rushdie archive to offer some preliminary insights. </p></div0></body></text></TEI.2>
