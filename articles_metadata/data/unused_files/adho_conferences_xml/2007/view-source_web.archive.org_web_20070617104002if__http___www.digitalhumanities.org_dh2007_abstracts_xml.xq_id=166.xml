                regularly and/or formally using internet technologies. Such communities are becoming
                increasingly important in arts and humanities research. They include blogs, wikis,
                mailing lists and other such fora. The Jiscmail and Listserv services (<xptr to="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk; http://www.lsoft.com" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), and the availability of well-known open source wiki and blog software (e.g.
                    <xptr to="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>
                and <xptr to="http://twiki.org" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>) have made it so easy to
                establish online communities that most projects in the digital and humanities now
                have one of some kind or another. However such fora are founded on relatively basic
                technologies. The various arts and humanities e-science and cyberinfrastructure
                programmes underway in many countries offer huge opportunities to enable online
                communities in ways that go far beyond what is generally available now. These
                approaches will be based on incomparably more complex tools, methods and
                technologies such as Virtual Organizations (VOs), Virtual Research Environments (see
                    <xptr to="http://www.ahessc.ac.uk/briefing-paper" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>)
                collaborative virtual workspaces, and Semantic Web. If these tools, methods and
                technologies are to be exploited by practice-led arts researchers and humanists to
                the greatest effect, they will need to be grounded in a strategic, rigorous and
                systematic understanding of the behaviours of current online communities, as complex
                online systems will clearly evolve from collaboration tools currently in use. The
                proposed paper will offer an overview of current usage of various online fora, and
                propose a high-level mapping from that overview onto the capabilities of the
                e-science-based collaborative systems of the future, such as MyVocs (<xptr to="http://www.myvocs.org/" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>).</p><p> Of immediate importance to the humanities are VREs, as they help geographically
                dispersed research groups to come together in virtual laboratories that allow
                modelling and experimentation as much as discussion of research results. The
                e-Science concept of a Virtual Organisation on the other hand is seen as a set of
                institutions and/or individuals defined by resource sharing policies. <note n="1">Foster and C. Kesselman, <title level="m"> The Grid 2: Blueprint for a new
                        computing infrastructure</title>, (Morgan-Kaufmann, 2004).</note> A VO is a
                community with the will to share resources and information across the internet,
                while VREs enable VOs by adding tools and methods that help the community to work
                together and share resources in a secure manner. VREs attempt to bring together
                researchers across disciplines and administrative boundaries. Many argue that
                humanities computing in general constitutes such an attempt, where the ‘glue’ is to
                find ‘methodological commons’<note n="2">See Willard McCarty <title level="m">
                        Humanities Computing</title>, (Basingstoke: Palgrave McMillan, 2005).</note>
                to present the disciplinary kinships among different disciplines in the humanities
                and in computing. A hi-tech VRE for arts and humanities computing could therefore
                make these computational methods the subject of online discussions enabled by
                advanced information discovery technologies. As a case study, this paper will report
                on our efforts to set up such a VRE. </p><p>The Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre (AHESSC) is in regular and direct
                contact with many online communities, and is in an excellent position to offer an
                overview. We will present findings from detailed research on the recent history of a
                range of existing discussion fora. These will include both moderated and unmoderated
                groups critically and qualitatively assessing the difference this makes, and
                extrapolate an agenda for the management systems needed for VREs. We will examine
                both direct and indirect links between messages, semantic commonalities,
                disciplinary vocabularies and threading patterns, and hyperlinking behaviour. We
                will also examine other well-established wiki and blog communities of relevance to
                the humanities in much the same way. The paper will draw out commonalities, identify
                points of conflict and the reasons underlying them, the implementation and practice
                of “netiquette’ codes, and the importance of sustaining archives and maintaining
                access to them. We argue that regardless of the technology, these are essential
                questions if the adoption of advanced collaborative tools is to be a success. A key
                remit of AHeSSC itself is to help develop a community of e-science ‘early adopters’,
                and the research presented forms a central part of this mission. We believe that
                more complex collaborative technologies will not only enable the transmission of
                ‘traditional’ scholarly communication in the form of text and images as in the
                current basic systems; but also they will facilitate access to large scale, complex
                and fuzzy data, and allow scholars to work together in real time with that data. For
                example, instead of sending a complex dataset as an email attachment to a group
                whose members then manipulate it according to their expertise and locally available
                software, and then send it back to the originator, the new architectures will allow
                two or (many) more to work on it in real time, to discuss it, expose it to
                analytical tools, and to annotate it online, whilst preserving a complete record of
                the workflow. We will show how close critical analysis of the existing lo-tech
                systems should inform the design of such architectures.</p><p>This will be illustrated by considering a VRE for arts and humanities computing
                methodologies for which funding is currently being sought. This project will
                continue the community building efforts of the UK’s AHRC ICT Methods Network (see
                    <xptr to="http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>), with a
                taxonomy of computational methods developed by the Arts and Humanities Data Service
                (see <xptr to="http://ahds.ac.uk/about/projects/documents/pmdb_taxonomy_v1_3_1.pdf" from="ROOT" targOrder="U"/>). This is seen as a first step to build a
                semantically enriched VRE, using the taxonomy as the foundation of an ontology. The
                taxonomy will be verified against papers from online databases or websites
                presenting tools and methods. Ontological approaches are used that allow not only
                the semantic integration of different text and multimedia resources, but also the
                tracking of exchanged arguments that help users better understand decisions about
                methodologies. Our paper will illustrate the evolutionary relationship between an
                advanced environment such as this, and the basic environments with which we are all
                familiar. </p></body></text></TEI.2>
