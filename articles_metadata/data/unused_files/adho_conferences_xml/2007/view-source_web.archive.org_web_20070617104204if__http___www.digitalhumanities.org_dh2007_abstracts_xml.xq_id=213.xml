                    standard tool for representing large art collections. A typical <emph>catalogue
                        raisonné</emph> includes images of artworks along with descriptive metadata,
                    commentary, and background information (often a biography of the artist) about
                    the collection. More recently, technological and infrastructural advances (in
                    particular, cheaper secondary memory, increased network bandwidth, computational
                    power, and digitization technology) have enabled development of the digital
                        <emph>catalogue raisonné</emph>. Some of these catalogues have been
                    developed primarily to support the construction of print-based catalogues
                    (Lanzelotte, et al., 1993; Gladney, et al. 1998), while others are intended for
                    online use (for example, The Vincent van Gogh Gallery and Gemini G.E.L.). The
                        <emph>Picasso Project</emph> (Mallen, 2006) has developed a digital
                    catalogue raisonné containing 11,000 of Picasso's artworks, along with 7,000
                    biographical entries. It is the most complete and up-to-date collection of
                    Picasso's prodigious body of work.</p><p>Building on the premise that the logical structures of the book do not support
                    scholarly inquiry adequately (McGann, 1997), we are using the Picasso digital
                    catalogue to facilitate scholarly work with art collections. Researchers,
                    students, and teachers in disciplines such as art history, painting, drawing,
                    history of art, and art appreciation deal with art collections. They analyze and
                    critique individual works and compare and contrast these with other works. They
                    identify similarities between pieces of art and trace threads of influence
                    between artworks, artists, styles, materials, themes, and social, geo-political,
                    or personal events. These scholars interpret artworks, identify missing links,
                    and communicate their findings. In the context of the Picasso collection, we
                    support scholars in expressing and visualizing the complex, multifarious
                    relationships between artworks via a Web-accessible software interface.</p></div0><div0><head>Approach</head><p>In a series of informal interviews with faculty members from art education,
                    history, Hispanic studies, art history, and with local K-12 art teachers we
                    found a diverse set of needs, interests, and approaches to working with artworks
                    in both education and research settings. One key theme running through each of
                    these areas is the need to discover and present relationships between artworks,
                    although the specific relationships of interest varied by discipline. The art
                    history scholar wishes to investigate relationships between artworks displayed
                    together in an exhibition or to study works composed when an artist was with a
                    particular lover. The historian wishes to view art in the context of significant
                    historical events, for example, artworks created while Europe was anticipating
                    World War I. K-12 teachers are interested in identifying artworks that provide
                    good examples of specific drawing or painting techniques, such as the two-point
                    perspective or the use of complementary color schemes.</p><p>In addition to the interviews, we also attended sessions of two college-level art
                    history survey courses. We observed that instructors typically showed one or two
                    examples of artworks from different artists or art movements, discussing each
                    for a few minutes. In subsequent interviews, the instructors explained that lack
                    of time constrains their ability to include additional works. Creating thematic
                    sub-collections based on the relationships discussed in class could alleviate
                    this problem, enabling students to study additional examples of materials
                    covered in the classroom. These observations of classroom interaction and
                    feedback from educators and researchers have informed our enhancements for
                    supporting the representation and visualization of diverse relationships over
                    the Picasso project’s artwork catalogue.</p><p>Picasso’s works cover a broad range of themes, topics, and materials, thus
                    presenting a rich substrate of artworks for building a network of semantically
                    diverse, meaningful relationships. In addition to the image collection, the
                    Picasso project includes extensive metadata related to these works, such as its
                    place and date of creation, medium, dimensions, current location, as well as
                    exhibitions and books in which it has appeared. We leverage much of this
                    metadata to express relationships based on ownership, materials, patronage, or
                    chronology.</p></div0><div0><head>Interactive Relationship Visualizer</head><p>The Interactive Relationship Visualizer (IRV), an interactive, Web-based
                    application, enables visualization of relationships that exist between artworks
                    in the archive. The IRV interface displays image sub-collections connected by
                    the relationship of the viewer’s focus. In addition, it presents connections
                    that exist within artworks in the sub-collection as well as those with others in
                    the archive, enabling users to navigate the intricately interconnected
                    hypertextual web defined by these relationships. While browsing, the the display
                    changes to reflect the dominant relationship being displayed. In order to
                    express a rich set of relationships, we are augmenting existing metadata to
                    include type (such as still life or portrait), art movement (cubism, fauvism,
                    surrealism), and content (woman, nude, vase, mirror).</p><p>The IRV distinguishes two broad categories of relationships, "inferred" and
                    "specified." Inferred relationships are those which can be expressed in terms of
                    the metadata elements provided for each artwork. Some inferred relationships can
                    be expressed in terms of a single metadata value, such as "artworks created with
                    oil on canvas." Others require mapping a range of metadata values onto a
                    higher-level concept and require definitions involving multiple metadata fields.
                    For example, identifying "paintings created in Paris around the time of World
                    War II" is a two-step process. The system must map the timeframe of World War II
                    to a portion of the traditional calendar and locate paintings created during
                    this time. It then selects from this set, those that were created in Paris
                    Finally, relationships such as "expensive paintings" involve subjective,
                    theory-driven, and potentially variable definitions. A price that would be
                    expensive in one art market might be comparatively inexpensive in another.
                    Inferred relationships provide a powerful mechanism for exploring, discovering,
                    and expressing relationships between artworks that leverages existing metadata.</p><figure rend="ImageLink"><head/><p><xref to="DITTO" from="ROOT" targOrder="U">paper_213_furuta_1.jpg</xref></p><figDesc>Figure 1: Interactive Relationship Visualizer system design.</figDesc></figure><p>In contrast to relationships inferred directly from existing metadata, other
                    types of relationships must explicitly be stated. We refer to these as
                    "specified" relationships. For example, Picasso sketched several rough drafts of
                    large works, interspersed with smaller works. Thus, a chronological view of
                    artwork around the time the <emph>Guernica</emph> was painted results in a
                    sub-collection that includes these preparatory works as well as other, unrelated
                    works. Hence, this "preparatory work" relationship must be expressed between
                    early sketches of the <emph>Guernica</emph> and the final masterpiece. Another
                    specified relationship is images based on a shared subject, for example,
                    Picasso’s interpretive series of works of Diego Velásquez’s <emph>Las
                    Meninas</emph>. Specified relationships afford us the ability to define and
                    represent relationships between artworks that are difficult to derive from the
                    descriptive metadata associated with each work. This category of relationships
                    is critical for the expression of concepts based in established and novel
                    analytical approaches to Picasso's work—allowing relationships based on
                    information beyond that which is encoded in the collection. The drawback is that
                    participation in specified relationships must be manually encoded.</p><p>Figure 1 displays the IRV system design. The Web interface employs specific
                    visualizations for displaying different kinds of relationships. For example, the
                    display of <emph>Guernica</emph> and its preparatory images uses a visualization
                    that illustrates the centrality of <emph>Guernica</emph> relative to the other
                    images displayed. In contrast, the display of all artworks in the <emph>Las
                        Meninas</emph> series uses a table-like view, since no image is clearly
                    central to this sub-collection. We employ artwork images from the Picasso
                    project, reinterpret and extend existing metadata to express myriad connections
                    between these artworks, and facilitate visualization of these relationships to
                    support art scholars from various disciplines.</p></div0><div0><head>Future Work</head><p>We continue to add new metadata to enrich the relationships expressed in our
                    archive. While new attributes enable us to express additional relationships, the
                    growing number of relationships gets increasingly difficult to represent
                    visually. We are investigating mechanisms to display secondary visualizations
                    without overwhelming the presentation of the primary relationship views. As
                    scholars analyze Picasso’s works and life, the relationships of their interest
                    are likely to increase in complexity as well as variety. It is not possible to
                    express all imaginable relationships among these artworks a priori, nor is it
                    possible to have all the necessary metadata. Enabling scholars to define useful
                    metadata as well as supporting them in forming new relationships will engage
                    them as partners in this project rather than as mere users.</p><p>The IRV has potential for exploration of artwork relationships in the classroom
                    as well as for evaluating student performance via homework and papers. For
                    example, students could explore a relationship and write a short paper about the
                    artworks it encompasses. An instructor could create a relationship and ask
                    students to identify the relationship embodied by the included artworks.
                    Educators need assistance in the form of targeted features for successful use of
                    the IRV in the classroom setting. We continue our dialog with instructors to
                    channel the IRV’s expressive power for enriching education.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Gladney, H.
