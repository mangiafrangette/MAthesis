                    by the Department of English and the MediaTeam research group (Dept. of
                    Electrical and Information Engineering, MediaTeam 2006) at the University of
                    Oulu and the SCOTS corpus project at the University of Glasgow (Scottish Corpus
                    of Texts and Speech, 2006), focuses on the languages and cultures of the
                    northern circumpolar region. Its underlying assumption is that language and
                    culture are as important to the survival and well-being of populations as more
                    obvious ecological, social and health issues and thus it is also a member of the
                    Circumpolar Health and Wellbeing research programme run by the Centre for Arctic
                    Medicine, University of Oulu (Thule Institute 2006).</p><p>The aim of the project is two-fold: firstly, the project aims to collect,
                    preserve and disseminate information about the languages spoken in the
                    circumpolar region, thus also enabling research on them. This will also help to
                    promote the linguistic confidence and self-image of the speakers of these
                    languages, strengthening their cultural awareness and facilitating
                    cross-cultural communication between these peoples in an age of rapid global
                    change (Winsa 1998).</p><p>Secondly, and more importantly, the project aims to create an electronic
                    framework for the collection, management, online display, and exploitation of
                    existing corpora of the languages of the circumpolar regions, which is also
                    applicable to other corpora that represent regional, social and other varieties
                    of languages. Humanities computing researchers, in particular, have long
                    recognized the need for new, more sophisticated tools to aid scholarly research
                    of textual data, not to mention tools that would be able to handle multimodal
                    data. Although a number of tools have been developed, they suffer from various
                    restrictions, e.g. they are only applicable to the data they were developed for,
                    importing data is laborious, user interfaces and encoding standards are
                    outdated, considerable expertise in programming is assumed, no support for
                    multilinguality is included, or they promise more than they offer. While there
                    have been some very promising advances made in this direction (e.g. TAPOR Tools
                    2006), it is clear that more tools are needed.</p><p>The framework being developed in this project is intended to be the equivalent of
                    an extendable toolbox for corpus linguists. It will attempt to offer much-needed
                    functionality in an easy-to-use package, which is shaped and built-on according
                    to real user needs. Initially emphasis will be given to the implementation of
                    the text capabilities of the system, but other modalities (such as audio and
                    video) are also taken into account. The idea is to facilitate queries into a
                    multimodal database using both proven and novel ways of finding and displaying
                    information (Seppänen 2006). Metadata and metadata visualisation, particularly
                    in conjunction with the new modalities, will be essential in achieving this.
                    While we support the use of best practices for the collection, preservation and
                    presentation of corpus data, we also recognize that some data, particularly
                    legacy data, may not be in a position to do so and the shell must also support
                    such data (Kretzschmar et al. 2006).</p><p>The system will also make migration to and from other tools straightforward by
                    offering import and export features for commonly used programs. It will enable
                    users to bring in their own data, which they can keep private or make public
                    using the built-in web functionality. The database will also be capable of
                    handling several different versions of any document (for example, revisions,
                    interpretations or translations); these are linked, a feature that can be made
                    use of in queries. Queries can be made using regular expressions, which may
                    combine free-form text (words, phrases) and part-of-speech tags, for example.</p><p>The system is implemented in Java making it platform independent and taking
                    advantage of the many technological components developed for that language. The
                    ultimate goal of the development of the computing tools is a shell which can be
                    adapted to any language. Therefore, support for multiple languages and a variety
                    of character encoding schemes are important.</p><p>The main focus of the project is on Meänkieli and Kven, two Finnic minority
                    languages spoken in Sweden and Norway, respectively, and Scots and Scottish
                    English. At present we have about 150 hours of tapes in Meänkieli and 100 hours
                    of tapes in Kven. More Kven material is currently being collected. We also have
                    access to both the structure and contents of the Scottish Corpus of Texts and
                    Speech (SCOTS) at the University of Glasgow, currently totalling 3.5 million
                    words of spoken and written Scots and Scottish English.</p><p>The project began in 2004 and a prototype of the shell has now been constructed.
                    We will demonstrate this shell, showing some of the basic functionality of the
                    system while looking into concrete research questions focusing on the image of
                    Scottishness as presented in Irvine Welsh’s <title level="m">Trainspotting</title> (1996). Since the
                    story is found in novel, play and movie versions, it affords an excellent
                    testbed for a toolbox that can handle multimodal data. Using a few key scenes as
                    examples, our research focuses on the questioning of national stereotypes in
                    terms of landscape, language and culture. We are thus interested in the
                    comparison of the images presented in the three versions, which will also
                    demonstrate the ability of the toolbox to support versioning. While we
                    concentrate on linguistic features of Scottish English, we also demonstrate how
                    easy-to-use access to sound and images linked to the transcription of the movie
                    and the linking between the three versions of the text greatly facilitate
                    research such as ours that must take into consideration images created both on
                    all levels of a text and across texts. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility
                    of making use of online dictionaries as an added tool in the analysis of data
                    from within the toolbox.</p><p>Since the shell is still in prototype form, we would welcome this opportunity to
                    discuss our needs and goals at DH2007, thus drawing on the considerable
                    expertise of the conference participants in order to ensure that our tools
                    benefit as wide a range of users as possible.</p></div0></body><back><div type="Bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><listBibl><biblStruct><analytic><author><name reg="Kretzschmar, W.
