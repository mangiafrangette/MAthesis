        <note type="abstract">Based on work done by Huitfeldt, Sperberg-McQueen, and Marcoux to develop a formal model of transcription, and by Caton as a result of this, the present paper elucidates six fundamental terms. The discussion aims both to clarify the existing work (and provide semantic constraints where none have been offered before) and to establish terms of reference for future work on the model of transcription (and related models).</note>

</p>
        <p>Work begun by Huitfeldt and Sperberg-McQueen (2008)
and continued jointly with Marcoux (2009, 2010) has given us a powerful and
intuitive model of the abstract object T
that counts as a successful transcription of an exemplar E.[1] (For convenience I will
hereafter refer to these authors collectively as 'HSM' and their work as 'the
HSM model'.)[2] Work on the HSM model is ongoing and a
comprehensive formal account of the activity of transcription remains some way
off, but extrapolating from what HSM have done so far we can begin to determine
what is proper to a model of transcription per
se, what is complementary to it, and what intra- and inter-model
dependencies exist between entities. We can project, as it were, from the existing
HSM model a bigger picture; but we stay always within the terms of the HSM model
because it is the terms themselves we use for our projection. We thereby also
clarify the terms themselves <hi rend="italic">as they are
used in the context of the model.</hi></p>
        <p>Here I focus on six terms fundamental to the 'bigger
picture' and by elucidating these terms in relation to the model I sketch out
the scope and composition of that picture: a necessary preliminary to any more
detailed modelling to follow. The terms are: SURFACE, MARK, READING,
TOKEN-SEQUENCE, EXEMPLAR, and DOCUMENT.</p>
        <p>Consider the following
scenario. A cave explorer discovers a new chamber and finds inside it three
rock faces. One has complex patterns of scratches on it, each of the other two
has painted lines on it. In all three cases what the explorer sees looks like writing, but she recognizes
none of it. She takes a photograph of the rock face with the scratches and of
one face with painted lines, then her camera fails. She pulls out a sketch pad
and makes a faithful drawing of the other rock face with paint on it. Later she
takes the photographs and drawing to an archeologist, who recognizes that the painted
lines are indeed writing, in a language he knows, but that the forms of the
characters are older and in many cases different from those in the current
orthography of that language. He then makes written copies of the characters he
sees in the photograph and drawing, this time using the current character forms
to make them easier for other scholars to read. Doubtful about the scratched
lines he informs a naturalist friend who visits the cave and confirms that all
the scratches have been made by animals sharpening their claws on the rock
face.</p>
        <p>Now we retrace the conceptual
movement of that narrative, introducing the fundamental terms in the
appropriate places and using the context to clarify their relation to the HSM
model and define them within that scope.</p>
        <p>Each rock face is a SURFACE.
A SURFACE is a thing: it is perceptible and measurable, and in its normal
manner of existence can be returned to. The normal manner of existence of an
electronic display, for example, is for a machine that generates it to be
switched on and working properly: and while this is the case, we can return to
the display.[3] A SURFACE is necessary for transcription; a SURFACE itself
depends on nothing within the scope of this discussion. Of all things I
describe here, a SURFACE is the closest to being a primitive entity.</p>
        <p>Each scratch and painted line
on the rock faces is a MARK. A MARK is a thing made upon a SURFACE by some
agent. It is perceptible and measurable by
contrast to the SURFACE, and therefore dependent upon the prior existence
of the SURFACE.</p>
        <p>The most complex of all the model-related entities is
a READING. I will say it is normative - though not necessary - that READING is motivated. We are a communicative
species and we actively look for instances of communication, willing to give
the benefit of the doubt in many cases. MARKS are necessary for orthography,
therefore the presence of MARKS implies the possible presence of writing.
Consequently the presence of MARKS also implies the possible presence of text (here and throughout intended in
the sense described in Caton 2013a), and text is written communication. Hence,
in the normative case, an understanding of the possible presence of text
motivates READING by an agent. In terms specific to the HSM model, READING is
the process by which an agent attempts to discover and establish at least one
TYPE-SEQUENCE in MARKS on a SURFACE by recognising certain MARKS to be certain
TOKENS.</p>
        <p>Because (in the normative case) READING is motivated,
we must also grant that it may be
entirely speculative. That is, it is acceptable that READING commences solely
on the basis that MARKS are present on a SURFACE: there does not have to be
certainty that at least one of those MARKS has token status.</p>
        <p>Recall that our cave explorer could not assign token
status to any of the marks she saw. Aware of her ignorance, she took steps
(taking photographs and making a drawing) that have an interesting status in
the overall picture because they seem to perform transcription without READING and therefore to deny
that READING is  necessary  to transcription.
But this is illusory. The goal of READING is to establish a
TOKEN-SEQUENCE/TYPE-SEQUENCE, and the act of READING attempts this, assigning
token status to MARKS where possible. There is no criterion of success for the
activity: simply performing it is enough.[4] There doesn't have to be a
specific TOKEN-SEQUENCE/TYPE-SEQUENCE at the end of it. </p>
        <p>Instead of 'success', we distinguish three
result-states of READING: <hi rend="bold">positive</hi>, <hi rend="bold">negative</hi>, and <hi rend="bold">zero</hi>. A positive result-state means the agent assigns, with a
greater-than-zero degree of certainty, token status to at least one MARK. A
negative result-state means that the agent, with a greater-than-zero degree of
certainty, decides no MARK has token status. A zero result-state means that for
every MARK present the agent has zero certainty that it is or is not a token.
We shall return to this important point shortly. </p>
        <p>An agent READS at least MARK by MARK (though more
usually by groups of MARKS at a time), assigns token status where possible, and
thereby constructs a TOKEN-SEQUENCE. A TOKEN-SEQUENCE cannot be empty: it must
contain at least one TOKEN. Under any one READING R a TOKEN-SEQUENCE is neither 'right' nor 'wrong': it simply is the sequence under that READING,
irrespective of the degree to which it corresponds to any text present on the
SURFACE.</p>
        <p>The dependence relation here is strictly one way and
is of transcription upon the TOKEN-SEQUENCE produced by the READING. If no
READING (minimal or informed) takes place,  
If there is a TOKEN-SEQUENCE, and if an agent desires to preserve its
corresponding TYPE-SEQUENCE in another place by the activity of transcription,
then that TOKEN-SEQUENCE assumes the role of EXEMPLAR with respect to the
transcription, and in that respect we refer to it as the E-TOKEN-SEQUENCE. The
manifestation in another place of the preserved TYPE-SEQUENCE as a
TOKEN-SEQUENCE produces a TRANSCRIPTION (as result) and we refer to that
sequence as the T-TOKEN-SEQUENCE.[5] Should an agent wish to transcribe this
T-TOKEN-SEQUENCE, the sequence would then assume the role of EXEMPLAR with
respect to this second transcription. </p>
        <p>The essential insight of the HSM model is <hi rend="italic">that
transcription is that the
T-TOKEN-SEQUENCE represents and preserves the E-TYPE-SEQUENCE</hi>. It should be
clear then that with respect to the painted rock faces the cave explorer does perform transcription, despite her
inability to consciously assign token status to any of the MARKS. By means of
the photograph and the drawing, each E-TYPE-SEQUENCE of the painted MARKS is
preserved and manifested in another place as a T-TOKEN-SEQUENCE, perceptible as
MARKS on a SURFACE. Transcription is always <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>
when the READING result-state is either positive or zero. It does not have to
happen deliberately, consciously - a transcription can be produced quite by
accident. The archaeologist's transcription, unlike the
explorer's, comes from positive result-state READING and he produces different
T-TOKEN-SEQUENCES from the explorer, but they all represent the same
E-TYPE-SEQUENCE.</p>
        <p>Transcription is possible from a zero result-state
          READING, but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> possible. The cave
explorer's photograph of the scratches, for example, is not a transcription
because no TOKEN-SEQUENCE is present on the scratched rock SURFACE and thus
there is no E-TYPE-SEQUENCE to preserve.[6]</p>
        <p>An act of transcription necessarily involves an
EXEMPLAR, but does not necessarily involve a DOCUMENT. In relation to a model
of transcription, and the model of READING which is necessary for it, we say
that when there is at least one TOKEN-SEQUENCE / TYPE-SEQUENCE on a SURFACE,
and the same READING that assigned token status to the MARKS <hi rend="italic">also</hi> assigns TEXT status to the
TOKEN-SEQUENCE / TYPE-SEQUENCE, then the SURFACE + TEXT combination acquires
DOCUMENT status.[7] In a majority of cases an agent READS a SURFACE either <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> it is a DOCUMENT or at least
believing that highly likely. Hence DOCUMENT is a term frequently used in
discussions of transcription, but transcription can take place without any
DOCUMENT being present.</p>
        <head>Notes</head>
        <p>[1] For work responding to
and building on the HSM model, see Caton 2009, 2013b.</p>
        <p>[2] I must assume the
reader's familiarity with the basics of the HSM model, in particular with their
use of Peirce's concepts of token and type. Huitfeldt and
Sperberg-McQueen 2008 gives the initial exposition; Caton 2013 provides a
summary.</p>
        <p>[3] I am avoiding the
words  'material' and 'persistent'
because (for the purposes of this discussion) those adjectives are not yet well
enough defined with respect to the digital domain. Despite my expressive
clumsiness I hope the reader understands that I am opposing the nature of
SURFACE and MARK to the essentially transitory, of-the-moment nature of a
phenomenon such as speech.</p>
        <p>[4] Obviously this differs
from the normal usage, where we expect someone performing the activity of
reading to recognize a specific token sequence and consider their reading incorrect if they don't.</p>
        <p>[5] Strictly speaking there
is no T-TYPE-SEQUENCE prior to the existence of the T-TOKEN-SEQUENCE, only the
E-TYPE-SEQUENCE. The T-TYPE-SEQUENCE is a product of the T-TOKEN-SEQUENCE.</p>
        <p>[6] Because a negative
result-state involves conscious judgement, it is entirely possible for one
agent to perform two different READINGS with different result-states: one
negative (by looking at MARKS on a SURFACE and deciding that none has token
status) and one zero (by also taking a photograph of the MARKS).</p>
        <p>[7] Because this ties
DOCUMENT to a particular SURFACE it means every DOCUMENT is a unique object and
not a 'repeatable symbolic expression' as discussed in Renear and Wickett
2009.  I consider this uncontroversial as
a constraint for the purposes of modelling, but I believe it also reflects a
core sense of the common usage. Certainly 'document' is often used in an
abstract sense, as in 'Magna Carta is an important document', but the
signification is strongly tied to the idea of a particular piece of paper (or
stone tablet, parchment scroll, email, etc.). </p>
