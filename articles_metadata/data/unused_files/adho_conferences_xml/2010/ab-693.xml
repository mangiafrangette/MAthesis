                <p>Thomas Sonnet de Courval's satirical work, the <hi rend="italic">Satyre Menippée
                        du mariage</hi>, was initially published in 1608. In 1609, an expanded
                    version appeared, with the addition of a second satire, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Timethélie, ou Censure des Femmes</hi>. In 1621, the first satire appeared
                    in a new edition titled <hi rend="italic">Satyre sur les Traverses du
                        Mariage</hi>, then in the following year, Sonnet de Courval published his<hi
                        rend="italic"> Œvres Satyriques</hi>. The<hi rend="italic"> Œvres</hi>
                    includes 12 satires, with the final six consisting of fragmented, re-organized
                    and re-edited versions of the <hi rend="italic">Satyre Menippée</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Timethélie</hi>. A new edition of the 1609 text was published
                    in 1623, edited by the publisher and probably without Courval's consent. In
                    1627, two more editions of the Œvres <hi rend="italic">Satyriques</hi> appeared.
                    (Coste 340-341). </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mariage sous L'ancien Régime</hi> project has already
                    digitized the 1609 text and most of the 1621, and will be working on other
                    editions in the future. Our objective is to produce a genetic edition of those
                    parts of Courval's work which bear on marriage; in particular, we would like to
                    map the process by which the original two satires (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Menippée</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timethélie</hi>) were re-constituted as
                    six satires in the <hi rend="italic">Œvres Satyriques</hi>. Since the texts are
                    lengthy (the 1609 text runs to nearly 3,000 lines), we have begun to investigate
                    ways to automate this mapping to some degree, and in particular, methods of
                    measuring similarity between two pieces of text. In particular, we needed to
                    find a way to detect corresponding lines between two witnesses, even when those
                    lines might have been both relocated and altered.</p>
                <p>The Universal Similarity Metric is a method of measuring the similarity of two
                    sets of data based on Kolmogorov complexity. It is described in Vitanyi (2005)
                    as &quot;so general that it works in every domain: music, text, literature,
                    programs, genomes, executables, natural language determination, equally and
                    simultaneously&quot; (1). A practical implementation of this metric can be
                    achieved using data compression, according to the following formula, where x and
                    y are the two pieces of data being compared:
                    <code xml:space="preserve">
  NCD(x,y) = C(xy) - min(C(x), C(y)) 
             ___________________
                    
                 max(C(x), C(y)) 
                    
(Vitanyi 2) </code>
                </p>
                <p> NCD is &quot;Normalized Compression Distance&quot;, an expression of the
                    similarity of x and y; C(x) and C(y) are the respective lengths of the two
                    compressed inputs; and C(xy) is the length of the compressed concatenation of x
                    and y. The resulting NCD is a value between 0 and 1, where proximity to zero
                    indicates greater similarity. This metric has been widely used in the sciences;
                    for instance, Krasnogor and Pelta (2004) describes its use to measure the
                    similarity of protein structures, and Li et al. (2004) apply it to evolutionary
                    trees and to building language trees based on text corpora. Its universality and
                    simplicity suggested that it might be the ideal tool to discover correspondences
                    between lines and line-groups at different points in two of Courval's texts. To
                    test it, I have created a prototype application using Borland Delphi. These are
                    some example values generated with the prototype (Figure 1): <table>

                </p>
                <p>Scores below 0.5 appear to be strongly indicative of similarity, while those over
                    0.6 usually signify disparity; it is actually quite difficult to generate any
                    score above 0.84, as shown by the final example, in which there are no points of
                    similarity at all.</p>
                <p>The prototype application takes two XML files as input, and performs the
                    following steps: <xmt:oList rend="arabic">
                        <item>Identifies the target elements to be compared (this is currently
                            hard-coded, but would ideally be based on user-specified XPath).</item>
                        <item>Adds @id attributes to any of those elements which don't yet have
                            them.</item>
                        <item>Extracts the text of all the target elements, and normalizes it in a
                            variety of ways (specified by the user).</item>
                        <item>Compares each single text item with each other text item, and
                            generates a comparison score for it.</item>
                        <item>(Optional) Runs an additional contextualizing algorithm which modifies
                            the original scores based on the scores of surrounding elements in the
                            document (see below).</item>
                        <item>Sorts the matches in ascending order of similarity score (best matches
                            first).</item>
                        <item>Presents each of these matches to the user for categorization as one
                            of: <xmt:uList>
                                <item>Corresponding (equivalent) items</item>
                                <item>Not corresponding, but an interesting relationship</item>
                                <item>No relationship at all</item>
                            </xmt:uList>
                        </item>
                        <item>Saves an XML file containing the scores for all matches, along with
                            any categorization values chosen by the user.</item>
                        <item>Saves copies of the input files with the added @id attributes, and
                            also a CSV version of the score data for use in a spreadsheet
                            program.</item>
                    </xmt:oList>
                </p>
                <p>This correspondence data can be used to provide a component of a critical
                    apparatus attached to a witness, linking it to corresponding lines in other
                    witnesses.</p>
                <p>Step 5 is an attempt to detect correspondences between lines in situations where
                    a line has changed significantly, or perhaps even been replaced completely, but
                    the lines around it still match closely. Normally, where lines differ, a high
                    score will be generated; if the user chooses only to examine the lower scores in
                    the search for correspondences, the link between these two lines may not be
                    detected. The contextualizing algorithm massages the score of each match such
                    that it is affected by the score of the lines around it; if the preceding and
                    following lines have low scores, the score of the line is lowered so that it too
                    may be detected more easily as &quot;corresponding&quot;, even though it has
                    been substantially changed. The contextualizing algorithm can be run many times
                    if required, massaging the scores each time. We are still investigating the
                    outcomes and value of this process.</p>

                <p>This application is in many ways similar to the TEI-Comparator project created as
                    part of the Holinshed Project. This is described in some detail in Cummings
                    (2009). When writing our <hi rend="italic">Mariage</hi> prototype at the
                    beginning of 2009, I was unaware of the TEI-Comparator project; in addressing
                    similar problems, we have arrived at remarkably similar solutions, especially in
                    terms of process. The comparison algorithm used by TEI-Comparator, which is
                    called Shingle Cloud, was developed by Arno Mittelbach, and uses a completely
                    different process of comparison based on n-grams. Documentation for
                    TEI-Comparator will be available soon; when it appears, I am looking forward to
                    running tests to compare results between Shingle Cloud and the Universal
                    Similarity Metric, and I will report the results in this paper.</p>
                <p>The prototype application will probably now be ported to C++, to create a
                    cross-platform application, and I also intend to create a standalone Java
                    library that can be called from the command line or from another Java
                    application; perhaps it might be integrated into TEI-Comparator as an
                    alternative comparison metric.</p>
