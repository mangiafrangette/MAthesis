                <p>This paper examines the spatiality of three contemporary literary narratives
                    using a digital humanities approach. By this I mean a few things: firstly, I
                    regard spatiality as a complex and dynamic historical dimension on par with
                    temporality, and not just as a static, passive container in which events
                    independently transpire. Secondly, I am interested in examining not only space
                    and place as represented in texts, but also the spatiality of the texts
                    themselves, i.e., the materiality of language. Thirdly, I have built the <hi
                        rend="italic">Litmap</hi> digital mapping platform (<ref
                        target="http://barbarahui.net/litmap" rend="newWindow" type="external"
                        >http://barbarahui.net/litmap</ref>) for the purpose of visualizing space
                    and place in/of texts, which I use in conjunction with traditional close reading
                    methods in order to carry out my scholarship.</p>
                <p>The definition of spatiality I employ follows from arguments made by spatial
                    theorists including Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, Doreen Massey, Edward Said and
                    Edward Soja, who push for an understanding of space and place as
                    socio-historically produced rather than somehow existing <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi>. I argue further that networked spatiality is a prevalent trope,
                    organizing principle, and way of understanding the world in contemporary texts.
                    I show how this presents itself in the narratives I examine (in quite a
                    different way in all three) and is a particularly useful, even crucial inroad
                    into understanding them. My assertion is that the three texts at hand can be
                    characterized as displaying three kinds of topographical networks: <xmt:uList>
                        <item> In W.G. Sebald’s <hi rend="italic">Rings of Saturn</hi> (1997),
                            geographical places are connected to each other via a historical network
                            of events, and the nodes of the network are primarily man-made
                            architectural structures.</item>
                        <item> In Emine Sevgi Özdamar’s <hi rend="italic">Seltsame Sterne starren
                                zur Erde</hi> (2008), geographical places are connected to one
                            another via the transnational migrations of people, and the nodes of the
                            network are these moving embodied subjects themselves. </item>
                        <item> In Steven Hall’s <hi rend="italic">Raw Shark Texts</hi> (2007),
                            language, thought, and memory are material and have spatial dimensions.
                            Places are connected to each other via these material traces, and the
                            nodes of the network, which are constituted by human subjects and their
                            linguistic traces, are ephemeral and unstable, with “un-space” figuring
                            as an otherworldly yet very real dimension in the narrative’s spatial
                            imaginary. In addition, the text of Raw Shark Texts itself is figured as
                            a material body of language and textual image, with patterned
                            connections running throughout the book.</item>
                    </xmt:uList>
                </p>
                <p> Both the core observations listed above and the sub-arguments presented in the
                    thesis were arrived at via a combination of <hi rend="italic">Litmap</hi>-based
                    and traditional print-based research methodologies. The current <hi
                        rend="italic">Litmap</hi> interface displays a map image of the Earth, with
                    place names and corresponding information from each text keyed to that
                    location’s coordinates on the map. In the case of <hi rend="italic">Rings of
                        Saturn</hi>, this allows for a fairly complex mapping since the nodes of the
                    network in that narrative correspond to unambiguous geographical place names and
                    locations. In the case of Özdamar’s and Hall’s texts, however, this becomes
                    increasingly challenging as space and place become more subjective and fluid,
                    requiring new and creative ways of visualizing data. The use of digital media to
                    map literature is thus useful both for revealing what it can and can’t do, and I
                    argue it is important to recognize both the strengths and constraints of the
                    medium as we continue exploring this new area of research.</p>
                <p> Moving forward, I plan to develop and extend the <hi rend="italic">Litmap</hi>
                    platform both in order to better address the crucial issues of how to visualize
                    ambiguous data, and also to improve upon the existing functionality for
                    searching, filtering, and browsing. The database underlying the current system
                    is flexible and extensible enough to accommodate information from far more
                    narratives, and I intend to enable users to upload other books for teaching and
                    research. Once a large corpora of texts is uploaded, this will open up the
                    ability to search across time and space and do other macro analyses of
                    literature. Perhaps most of all, however, I look forward to making <hi
                        rend="italic">Litmap</hi> a truly collaborative project. My hope is to
                    assemble a team of colleagues who will be invested in working together on
                    creative technical and design solutions for the platform.</p>
