                <p>Digital humanities scholarship often integrates humanities scholarship (literary
                    studies, historical studies, and so on) with technological research and
                    development. Some of this technological work takes the form of standards
                    development. The most noteworthy example of such standards development in the
                    digital humanities community is the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The TEI
                    provides Guidelines for encoding texts for scholarly and general use. The TEI is
                    pervasive in digital humanities and digital library contexts. It is a de facto
                    standard developed and evolved over the past twenty some years through the
                    efforts of a number of dedicated scholars, librarians, and technologists, and
                    with input from the larger community of TEI users.</p>
                <p>Another standard of significance to the digital humanities community is Unicode.
                    Our paper presents a case-study of a successful effort to have included in the
                    Unicode standard dozens of characters required by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chymistry of Isaac Newton</hi>, an ongoing digital humanities project to
                    digitize and edit, study and analyze the alchemical works of Isaac Newton and to
                    develop various scholarly tools around the collection. Unicode has become the
                    universal character encoding standard. Unicode is nothing more, as it is
                    certainly nothing less, than a massive mapping of characters to numbers, a
                    mapping that seeks to accommodate all the world’s languages and writing systems,
                    including symbols of all sorts—mathematical symbols and operators, astronomical
                    and astrological symbols, Zapf Dingbats, and many more. Operating systems, and
                    the applications built upon them—databases, word processors and text editors,
                    browsers, graphics software, and games—depend on such mappings, or encodings, to
                    reliably reference, store, input, output, and display textual data. The Unicode
                    Consortium’s “What is Unicode” page <ref type="external"
                        target="http://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html"
                        >http://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html</ref> accurately reports the
                    standard’s significance: <q>Unicode is required by modern standards such as XML,
                        Java, ECMAScript (JavaScript), LDAP, CORBA 3.0, WML, etc., and is the
                        official way to implement ISO/IEC 10646. It is supported in many operating
                        systems, all modern browsers, and many other products. The emergence of the
                        Unicode Standard, and the availability of tools supporting it, are among the
                        most significant recent global software technology trends.</q>
                </p>
                <p>In spite of Unicode’s impressive comprehensiveness, it does not include every
                    character ever used. It does not at present, for instance, include many of the
                    alchemical symbols found in Isaac Newton’s alchemical writings. Unicode provides
                    a “private use area,” a series of reserved <hi rend="italic">code points</hi>
                    (the numbers assigned to characters) for projects and products to use
                    “privately” for mapping to characters not represented in Unicode. A project like
                    the <hi rend="italic">Chymistry of Isaac Newton</hi> can make use of this
                    private use area to map to characters that are not already described in the
                    standard. A pitfall of the Private Use Area is that it is meant to be used
                    privately; it is not suitable for easily interchangeable or interoperable data.
                    One project’s implementation of the Private Use Area could conflict with another
                    project’s. And fonts would not typically include characters for Private Use Area
                    code points, since by their nature these codepoints are not assigned permanently
                    to any one character but are perpetually open for <hi rend="italic">private</hi>
                    assignment, not as part of the public standard.</p>
                <p>So when a project stumbles upon a rich collection of important characters and
                    symbols that are relevant and useful beyond the interior confines of one’s own
                    project, one can make a significant scholarly contribution by documenting and
                    describing these characters and proposing them for inclusion in the Unicode
                    encoding standard. The alchemical symbols so common in Isaac Newton’s chymical
                    manuscripts, are common also throughout manuscript and print alchemical
                    literature. The graphically and semantically rich symbols also have potential
                    utility in design, computer art, and even gaming applications. Even the few
                    symbols that are potentially unique to Newton are worthy of consideration in the
                    Unicode standard, given Newton’s stature as one of the giants of science and the
                    vast wealth of scientific, historical, biographical, and popular literature
                    related to Newton.</p>

                <p>The process by which one moves a Unicode proposal through the development,
                    review, and approval process is formal and rigorous. It is very rewarding in
                    fostering a better understanding of one’s source material and in pointing the
                    way to undiscovered or avoided basic research questions. To encode and identify
                    characters and symbols, one must name the things, and naming is indeed a very
                    difficult and powerful task, a task often challenged and enriched by puzzling
                    ambiguity and obscurity. The process is very rewarding also because it is very
                    much peer-reviewed. Our proposal greatly benefited from an iterative review and
                    excellent advice, challenging questions, and constructive criticism from a
                    number of very smart, helpful, interested experts serving on the Unicode
                    Technical Committee (UTC).</p>
                <p>Our paper provides a case-study of one project’s navigation through the Unicode
                    proposal, review, and approval process. We also provide a more theoretical
                    discussion, illustration, and examination of the mutually beneficial
                    relationship between technical standards development and basic humanities
                    research.</p>
