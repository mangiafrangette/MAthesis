        <body>
            <p>Digital libraries are a key technology for hosting large-scale collections of
                electronic literature. Since the first digital library (DL) systems in the early
                1990s, the sophistication of DL software has continually developed. Today, systems
                such as DSpace and Greenstone are in use by institutions both large and small,
                providing thousands of collections of online material. However, there are
                limitations even to “state-of-the-art” DLs when considering digital humanities.</p>
            <p>Contemporaneously with the growth of DL technology, digital scholarly editions of
                significant texts and archival material have emerged. In contrast to digital
                libraries, where there are a number of readily available generic software systems,
                critical editions are largely reliant on bespoke systems, which emphasise internal
                connections between multiple versions. Whilst useful editions are online, and are
                increasingly used in scholarly endeavour, digital scholarly editions suffer from
                “siloing”: each work becoming an island in the ocean of the web.</p>
            <p>Like ‘physical’ libraries, digital libraries provide consistent support for
                discovering, reading and conserving documents in large collections. For scholarly
                editions, these features present a potential solution to “siloing”. Without trusted
                digital repositories, preservation and maintenance are endemic problems, and
                providing consistent experiences and unified workspaces across many sites (i.e.
                individual texts) is proving highly challenging. However, current DL systems lack
                critical features: they have too simple a model of documents, and lack scholarly
                apparatus.</p>
            <p>Digital library systems can readily contain electronic forms of “traditional”
                critical editions in static forms where each work is a separate and indivisible
                document. However, search facilities cannot then reliably distinguish between
                commentary and the primary content. Using XML formats such as TEI can permit this
                distinction to be made, but only with extensive configuration. Furthermore, the
                reading experience in such a DL is likely to fall far below scholars’ requirements
                of digital editions.</p>
            <p>European initiatives, such as DARIAH, focus on facilitating access to existing
                scholarly editions, with longer-term aims of fostering standards and
                interoperability of data. This approach presumes that each existing site (and hence,
                typically, edition) remains autonomous, and remains a discrete entity, which is then
                aggregated through a centralised service. It also admits the absence of
                standardised, highly functional storage and publication systems. Furthermore, this
                approach has been attempted in “federated” DLs, with only limited success. In
                federated DLs, unless every member uses the same software configured in the same
                manner, the appearance of each library differs and – worse – preservation remains in
                the hands of individual sites, and cross-site services (e.g. search) can only
                operate at a very rudimentary level.</p>
            <p>There have been projects to develop generic scholarly edition software, but success
                has been limited. Shillingsburg [<ref cRef="#Bib.1">Buchanan 2006</ref>] highlights
                a number of such systems up to the mid-2000s. Few of these initiatives engaged with
                computer science, and the software systems have proved hard to maintain.</p>
            <p>Digital library systems provide a potential route for providing collections of
                digital scholarly editions. However, they are not yet an answer. When a digital
                edition supports discussion between scholars, grounded on and linked to the text,
                the standard DL infrastructure requires extensive modification. Data structures are
                required to capture and store scholarly discourse, relate each item of discourse in
                detail to part of a complex document structure, and provide this through a seamless
                and consistent user interface. Multiple structures and complex document
                relationships fit uneasily within current DL software [<ref cRef="#Bib.2">Buchanan
                        <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 2007</ref>,<ref cRef="#Bib.3">Rimmer <hi
                        rend="italic">et al.</hi> 2008</ref>]. For instance, most DL software
                requires or assumes that any collection of documents is homogenous in terms of the
                interior structure of each document. This simply cannot be true of a collection
                including – say – diaries, journals, letters and novels. We need software that
                provides DL collection support with the ability to provide for complex document
                structure.</p>
            <div>
                <head>Current Work</head>
                <p>The goal of our research is to develop software that transcends the current
                    limitations of DL systems in supporting digital scholarly editions for the
                    humanities. Our intention is that in turn organisations and publishers who seek
                    to provide series of critical material can build upon software that is scalable,
                    systematically engineered and sustainable. This software will also support the
                    necessary complexity of critical editions and possess a rich apparatus to
                    support contemporary digital practices, not simply digitised forms of practice
                    from the print era. Whilst no single system is likely to provide all the
                    requirements of all possible circumstances, our aim is to create software that
                    can provide the technical core of any collection of critical editions, with a
                    minimum of effort. Adapting the system for a specific need may require extensive
                    work, but only for more unusual circumstances. This would bring us to a point
                    comparable to the support that current DLs give for simpler texts and scholarly
                    practices. For users of scholarly editions – i.e. the research community – the
                    presence of a common infrastructure and the increased ease of working across
                    sites will very likely increase research activity across multiple
                    ‘editions’.</p>

                <head>Context and Motivation</head>
                <p>This project has identified Wales as presenting an interesting case study. It is
                    a distinct cultural entity with an abundance of valuable written cultural
                    material and a sizable scholarly community researching the cultural life and
                    output of the nation. Reflecting the bilingual linguistic identity of the
                    nation, there are extensive archives and printed matter in national, university,
                    local government and private hands in both Welsh and English (as well as other
                    languages). Wales suffers from a poor physical infrastructure, and this has
                    motivated the provision of digital access to cultural material, from the early
                    days of the National Library of Wales’s digitisation projects (e.g. ‘Campaign’
                    1999) to the present.</p>
                <p>While the National Library of Wales has done outstanding pioneering work in
                    digitisation of its collections and remains an asset in our selection of Wales
                    as a ‘case study’, their remit does not extend to the interpretation of their
                    collections. Despite considerable demand from scholars in Wales and beyond for
                    digital critical editions of Welsh material (in both languages) no one project
                    has access to the technical expertise to create software that embodies the
                    requirements of the scholarly community. The motivation of our project is to
                    build a common infrastructure that both enables each project to produce
                    high-quality scholarly work, and provides for consistent access and preservation
                    of that work.</p>

                <head>Understanding User Needs</head>
                <p>To undertake this work requires not only technical expertise, but also a
                    systematic study of the requirements of scholarly practice in the digital age.
                    To date, we have reviewed the existing literature, and gained an initial set of
                    requirements from a retrospective analysis of data from the recent User Centred
                    Interactive Search (UCIS) project at University College London [<ref
                        cRef="#Bib.3">Rimmer <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 2008</ref>].</p>
                <p>The UCIS project revealed that many technical difficulties emerged when
                    configuring DL systems, even with relatively simple digital humanities material.
                    Humanists do not necessarily search for material that directly corresponds to
                    the “book” or “document” level of a particular library. Items may be sought that
                    constitute part of a single document (e.g. a poem in a collection of poetry),
                    and conversely larger works may be realised in several separate “documents”.
                    Search and browse facilities typically work only at one level, typically
                    consonant with either a book or article. However, collections are frequently
                    heterogeneous and multi-layered. In the case of critical editions, the
                    complexity of document structure and users’ tasks is even greater.</p>
                <p>A second problem is that humanists often require different variants of one work.
                    Though library infrastructures can relate these together, using standard
                    features alone is insufficient [<ref cRef="#Bib.4">Shillingsburg 2006</ref>].
                    Even the more developed features that of a few DL systems are simplistic when
                    compared to the complex relationship between different renditions and editions
                    of a work that critical scholarship requires. Current methods relate entire
                    separate items together – e.g. a chapter to a chapter – but scholarly criticism
                    and annotation do not neatly conform to the clean structural boundaries favoured
                    in computer or library science.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, whilst some specific digital library installations do permit individual
                    works to be linked to their author, or even specific words in a text to related
                    material, this is not a standard part of DL software, and in contrast to the
                    advanced facilities available in the best hypertext systems, the current
                    technologies are primitive [<ref cRef="#Bib.5">Goose <hi rend="italic">et
                            al.</hi> 2000</ref>].</p>
                <p>These shortcomings represent only a few of the problems already identified, and
                    while we have developed partial solutions to parts of these, our technologies
                    are not yet comprehensive, and other challenges have yet to be answered at
                    all.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>This presentation will articulate the shortcomings and problems raised when
                    collections of critical materials are hosted through current digital library
                    systems, and the contrasting “siloing” problems faced in the field of digital
                    critical editions. We will demonstrate the requirements that will have to be
                    matched to provide a single software system that delivers the needs of critical
                    editions whilst also providing methods to develop collections of critical works.
                    We illustrate how some of these requirements can be met, and prioritise and
                    elucidate the remaining challenges in creating a unified system.</p>
