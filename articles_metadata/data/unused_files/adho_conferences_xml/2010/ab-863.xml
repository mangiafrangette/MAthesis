                <p>People often want to collect and utilize free, publicly available images on a
                    given subject. Image sharing systems such as Flickr store billions of
                    user-contributed images. While such systems are designed to encourage user
                    contributions and sharing, they are not well-organized collections on any given
                    subject. We propose an approach that systematically harvest images from Internet
                    and organize the images into an evolving faceted classification. We implemented
                    a prototype to continuously harvest the most popular images on Flickr related to
                    African American history, and organize them into an evolving faceted
                    classification collaboratively maintained by users. The same approach can be
                    applied to other digital humanities resources on the Internet. The talk will
                    elaborate the details of technical design and prototype implementation, and
                    discuss evaluation results.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Flickr hosted over 4 billion images as of October 2009 and is growing by about 4
                    million pictures a day. Facebook hosted 15 billion photos and Imageshack hosted
                    20 billion images as of April 2009. Other photo sharing sites such as Picasa,
                    Multiply and PhotoBucket also host billions of images [Schonfeld, 2009]. In
                    contrast, organized public domain image collections are relatively scarce
                    [Wikipedia: 'Public domain image resources']. The largest public domain image
                    repository, Wikimedia Commons, reached 5 million images as of September
                    2009.</p>
                <p>It would greatly benefit the humanities community if images in those image
                    sharing sites can be organized and utilized. We propose an approach that
                    systematically searches and harvests images (actually the link to the image and
                    metadata, but not image itself) from image sharing sites, and organizes the
                    images into a multi-faceted classification. The data harvesting is performed on
                    a continual basis, and the classification evolves over time. Besides automated
                    programs, the approach utilizes collaborative human efforts to improve the
                    quality of collection. We implemented a prototype that builds a dynamic image
                    collection on African American History from the most popular images on this
                    subject on Flickr.com. Our fundamental belief is that a large, diverse group of
                    people (students, teachers, etc.) can do better than a small team of librarians
                    or editors in constructing a multimedia collection at virtually no cost.</p>
                <p>Note that not all the images on those sharing sites are copyright-free or have a
                    creative commons license. However, most of the sites allow other websites to
                    directly link to their images if the images are marked as public access by their
                    contributors, and if credits are properly given. Our approach displays images
                    through embedded image URLs but does not download the images from their original
                    sources.</p>

                <head>Related Work</head>
                <p>Many are trying to utilize the images in fast-growing photo sharing and social
                    networking sites. For example Getty Images, the leader in stock photography,
                    hires image editors to select most popular Flickr images and obtain copyright
                    from individual contributors, then sells the images for $5 per image (<ref
                        target="http://www.gettyimages.com" rend="newWindow" type="external"
                        >http://www.gettyimages.com/</ref>). Computer-graphics researchers at the
                    University of Washington have utilized Web images to digitally reconstruct
                    buildings in 3-D. For example, based on 150,000 publicly accessible Flickr
                    pictures of Rome, the program automatically re-created the Colosseum, Trevi
                    Fountain, and the outside and inside of St. Peter's Basilica, among other Roman
                    icons. The technique can be used to make virtual-reality experiences for
                    tourism, auto-build cities for video games and movies, or help digitally
                    preserve and study historic cities that are being destroyed by human-caused or
                    environmental factors [Jaggard 2009].</p>
                <p>Researchers have argued for building an academic Flickr, or an academic photo
                    sharing site in general: a net-based service that would enable faculty and
                    researchers to post and share images with scholarly value, either with the
                    general community, or pursuant to any associated rights, to restricted-use
                    populations [P. Brantley's blog]. For example, a group at Lewis &amp; Clark
                    College in Portland is in the process of developing an educational collection of
                    contemporary ceramics images using the photo sharing site Flickr [McWilliams
                    2008].</p>
                <p>Our project attempts to build free, well-organized topical images collections
                    from the images contributed by Internet users, to support education or research
                    objectives. While most photo sharing systems support keyword-based search
                    utilizing user-contributed metadata, none of them support browsable hierarchies
                    that allow users to explore a given subject in depth. Using librarians or images
                    editors to manually construct a topical collection is cost prohibitive, and
                    unfeasible if the collection needs to keep up with rapidly growing data sources.
                    Our collection-construction approach combines the collaborative concepts of wiki
                    and social tagging systems with automated classification techniques. Our system
                    allows users to collaboratively build a classification schema with multi-faceted
                    categories, and to classify documents into this schema. Utilizing users’ manual
                    efforts as training data, the system’s automated techniques build a faceted
                    classification that evolves with the growing collection, the expanding user
                    base, and the shifting user interests.</p>

                <head>Architecture and Prototype Implementation</head>
                <p>Our collection construction approach is summarized in Figure 1. The system first
                    collects images (links and metadata such as tags) on a given topic using keyword
                    search, utilizing the APIs (Application Programming Interface) provided by image
                    sharing sites or search engines. For the initial collection, a group of experts
                    or administrators create the initial classification schema and classify a set of
                    images into the initial schema. Utilizing experts’ classifications as training
                    data, and also Wordnet and Wikipedia as knowledge bases, the system employs
                    automated techniques (heuristic matching rules and support vector machine-based
                    classifiers) to classify images into the classification schema. In a wiki
                    fashion, users of the image collection can modify and improve the classification
                    schema, and manually classify items into the schema. Users can also assign
                    additional tag or annotations to image objects. Utilizing the additional
                    metadata from users’ tagging and annotation efforts and by analyzing users’
                    classification/usage history, the system refines both the classification schema
                    and the item-category associations. The system continues to collect and classify
                    images to stay up-to-date with external image sources.</p>

                <p>We built a prototype to construct an image collection on African American History
                    from Flickr. By querying “African American History” in the search field, we
                    extracted metadata for all the images in the result pages: title, url,
                    description, tags, and the contributor. The initial collection contained about
                    11,000 Flickr images on African American History. Over 3 months the collection
                    has grown to contain about 13,000 images. During the conference we will
                    elaborate the details of technical design, prototype implementation, and the
                    evaluation results. Figure 2 shows the browsing and classification interfaces of
                    our prototype.</p>

                <head>Discussion</head>
                <p>Evaluation of the prototype in a classroom environment shows promise. Measured by
                    metrics such as precision, recall and image quality (popularity), the prototype
                    is more effective than Flickr in supporting several image retrieval tasks. The
                    evolution of classification shows improvements, based on user ratings of
                    categories and category-item associations. We conducted interviews and usage
                    observations, which help understand the level of efforts that users spend on
                    tagging and classification. For future research, we are interested in whether
                    social tagging and tag convergence [<ref cRef="#Bib.6">Muller <hi rend="italic"
                            >et al.</hi> 2008</ref>] can be utilized to assist or substitute
                    classification efforts.</p>
                <p>Our approach can be applied to other digital humanity resources. For example, we
                    have developed another prototype to construct a dynamic collection of news items
                    on a given topic based on Google News. We believe that a combination of
                    collaborative and automated classification techniques can construct valuable
                    digital humanities collections at low costs.</p>
                <p>As far as we know, no one has combined user efforts and automated techniques to
                    build a faceted classification. Several research projects are related to social
                    tagging and classification, however. Several projects attempt to construct tag
                    hierarchies or ontologies, or otherwise harvest the intelligence stored in tags
                        [<ref cRef="#Bib.7">Heymann and Garcai-Molina 2006</ref>, <ref cRef="#Bib.8"
