<h3>Testing Burrows's 'Delta'</h3>
<p>
﻿In his Busa Award presentation and two recent
articles, John F. Burrows has presented a new measure
of stylistic difference that seems quite promising in
authorship attribution, and possibly also in stylistic
studies (2001, 2002, 2003). This unitary measure,
which he calls 'Delta,' like many other techniques, is
based on the differences in the frequencies of the most
frequent words in a group of texts"in this case, "verse
by twenty-five poets of the English Restoration
period" (2003: 10). Burrows uses the frequencies of
the 150 most frequent words of the entire set of texts in
his exposition of the method, comparing the mean
frequency of each word in the whole set with its
frequency in the texts of each of the authors
sequentially. His technique uses z-scores, which are
calculated by subtracting the mean frequency of each
word in the entire set from its frequency in the test
text, and dividing this difference by the standard
deviation of the word in the entire set. This method
allows all of the 150 words in his set to have equal
weight, in spite of their very different frequencies.
Burrows then eliminates the sign of the difference
(which indicates whether the word is less frequent or
more frequent than the mean for the whole set), adds
the z-scores together, and calculates the mean. This
mean is Delta,  "the mean of the absolute differences
between the z-scores for a set of word-variables in a
given text-group and the z-scores for the same set of
word-variables in a target text" (2002: 271).
     </p>
<p>Delta proves remarkably effective in
identifying authors in a difficult "open" test. When
texts of sixteen authors who are included in the
original set and sixteen authors who are not are tested
with Delta to determine likely authorship, "Of thirty-
two long poems, . . . fifteen are correctly identified and
another fifteen yield scores that correctly place them
outside the main set" (Burrows, 2003: 15). Although
this result is not completely accurate, is very
encouraging, and it suggests that delta may be a very
useful tool in the early stages of an authorship study in
which there are large numbers of possible authors.
     </p>
<p>Because of its great potential, delta deserves
further investigation, and I have begun a series of tests
on novels published about 1900, to see if Burrows's
success with poetry can be duplicated with prose. The
choice of 1900 as a central date ensures a large
selection of texts for testing without scanning: many
such novels, now out of copyright, are already
available as e-texts. After cleaning up the e-texts to
correct for problems of hyphenation, apostrophes, and
single quotation marks, I have extracted samples of
approximately 25,000 words of pure authorial
narration from more than 100 novels. Using a
combination of text-analysis tools, and custom
programming, I have collected the most frequent
words from each of the samples for comparison. 
     </p>
<p>Burrows's analysis (2002) shows that the
accuracy of Delta decreases as he reduces the
frequency list from the 150 to the 40 most frequent
words, and Hoover (2002, 2003) has shown that
cluster analyses based on as many as the 800 most
frequent words are often more accurate than those
based on the traditionally-used smaller lists. Therefore,
I have collected the 800 most frequent words of each
text, and have set up a complex Excel spreadsheet that
accepts as input sets of columns of the most frequent
words from up to 80 primary and 80 secondary texts
for analysis. A macro calculates Delta for each of the
primary texts and then for each of the secondary texts
in turn, beginning with the 800 most frequent words,
and continuing with the 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200,
150, 100, 70, 50, 30, and 20 most frequent. Another
macro then moves through the results, calculating the
rank of the actual author for texts by authors in the
main set and extracting the information in an format
for easy graphing. This automation assures the
accuracy of the analysis, saves countless hours of
tedious and painstaking drudgery, and allows for the
testing of many differently selected sets of frequent
words. For example, I have tested the following eight
different kinds of sets:

          </p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The most frequent words.
          </li>
<li>Contractions removed.
          </li>
<li>Personal pronouns removed.
          </li>
<li>Contractions and personal pronouns
              removed.
          </li>
<li>Words for which a single text supplies more
              than 70% of the occurrences removed.
          </li>
<li>Contractions and words for which a single
              text supplies more than 70% of the occurrences
              removed.
          </li>
<li>Personal pronouns and words for which a
              single text supplies more than 70% of the
              occurrences removed.
          </li>
<li>Contractions, personal pronouns, and words
              for which a single text supplies more than 70%
              of the occurrences removed.

     </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Research is still in progress, but preliminary
results are available for a primary set of 22 American
authors (represented by one third-person novel each)
that have been tested against 20 third-person American
novels from authors in the primary set. As Figure 1
shows, Delta is quite effective, in two cases attributing
19 of the 20 novels to the correct author. (The 20th,
which  surprisingly ranks 5th, is one of two novels by
Ellen Glasgow in the secondary set. The other is
consistently identified correctly. This case invites
further investigation, because the novel that is not
correctly identified was written about 10 years later
than the other two, and is sometimes considered to be
Glasgow's first novel in her mature style. The
preliminary research also shows that removing
contractions reduces the accuracy of the analyses, but
removing personal pronouns improves it (for similar
results, see Hoover, 2002). Finally, removing words
for which a single text supplies more than 70% of the
occurrences improves the accuracy quite dramatically,
producing the only results with 19 of the 20 texts
correctly attributed.
     </p>
<p>Although Burrows showed that texts by authors
from the main set usually produce Deltas significantly
lower than those by authors from outside the main set,
as one would expect, my initial tests on prose show
somewhat weaker results: the Deltas of texts by
authors from the main set are generally lower, but
some show Deltas higher than some of the texts by
authors from outside the main set. For this set of prose
texts, Delta is more effective in suggesting correct
authors than in eliminating incorrect potential
claimants. More testing is necessary to determine
whether the use of a single novel for each author in the
main set may result in less accurate results than those
Burrows achieved when most of his authors were
represented by a group of poems, and whether work on
attribution should be limited to texts with the same
point of view or nationality. Nevertheless, Burrows
Delta seems poised to become a valuable addition to
the authorship attribution toolbox.
