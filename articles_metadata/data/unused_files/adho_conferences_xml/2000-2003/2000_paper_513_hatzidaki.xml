            <div>
                <p>This paper presents the results of a large-scale corpus-based study (Hatzidaki
                    1999) of an important feature of English phraseology, namely binomial pairs
                        (e.g.<emph rend="italics"> chalk and cheese</emph>, <emph rend="italics">up
                        and down</emph>, <emph rend="italics">prim and proper</emph>, <emph
                        rend="italics">through and through</emph>, <emph rend="italics">Laurel and
                        Hardy</emph>). The purpose of the research was two-fold, firstly, to
                    conduct, on the basis of a large and varied corpus of English textual data, a
                    thorough and in-depth structural and functional analysis of a much-studied and
                    yet not fully explored phraseological phenomenon; and secondly, to examine the
                    hypothesis that the use of systematically collected samples of authentic
                    language data results in more accurate and comprehensive descriptions of the
                    form and function of linguistic phenomena than does the sole reliance on
                    introspection. The analysis yielded an extensive and rigorous taxonomy of the
                    various structural variations of binomials, as well as significant new
                    information on their function in the communicative process.</p>
                <p>Binomials, namely sequences of "two or more words or phrases belonging to the
                    same grammatical category, having some semantic relationship and joined by some
                    syntactic device such as 'and' or 'or'" (Bhatia 1994:143), have long been
                    objects of interest for idiomatologists and stylisticians. The several existing
                    studies of this phenomenon have mainly focussed on its marked occurrence in the
                    works of certain literary authors such as Chaucer, Lydgate, Shakespeare, Swift,
                    Shaw, etc. (see, respectively, Héraucourt 1939 and Potter 1972, Tilgner 1936,
                    Nash 1958 and Gerritsen 1958, Milic 1967, and Ohmann 1962), as well as in
                    English legal texts; the semantic and syntactic characteristics and
                    idiosyncrasies of the various paired forms, especially the semantic relationship
                    between the linked members of a binomial (synonymy, <emph rend="italics">able
                        and talented</emph>; antonymy, <emph rend="italics">boys and girls</emph>;
                    complementarity, <emph rend="italics">bow and arrow</emph>; Malkiel 1959), or
                    the notion of <emph rend="italics">irreversibility</emph>, i.e. the tendency of
                    binomials to occur in only one sequence, as in <emph rend="italics">here and
                        there</emph> and not *<emph rend="italics">there and here</emph>, and the
                    possible causes of this phenomenon (e.g. 'proximal before distal'; Cooper and
                    Ross 1975); and the incidence of binomials in languages other than English (e.g.
                    Fix 1985 for German; Abraham 1950 for French and Italian; Malkiel 1959 for
                    Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Ancient Greek and Latin; Gold 1991 for Yiddish;
                    Koch 1983 for Arabic; Szpyra 1983 for Polish; etc.).</p>
                <p>As opposed to literary studies, where binomials are treated as a flexible and
                    interesting stylistic device which serves as a powerful means of expressing the
                    authors' ideology and worldview, most studies of the occurrence of this feature
                    in general language implicitly or explicitly regard binomials as a small and
                    probably finite set of structurally and semantically idiosyncratic forms.
                    Moreover, although many studies of the formal characteristics of binomials are
                    available, there exists no comprehensive account of the full structural
                    variability of the binomial pairs used by the average speaker, no detailed
                    information on the distribution of the different patterns, and no organized
                    taxonomy of forms. Finally, with the notable exception of studies of binomials
                    as a distinctive feature of the language of the law which fulfils the
                    requirements of legal draftsmanship for precision, clarity, unambiguity and
                    all-inclusiveness (Mellinkoff 1963, Gustafsson 1984, Bhatia 1994), minimal
                    attention has been given to the functions of binomials in non-literary
                    language.</p>
                <p>Crucially, with very few exceptions (notably Gustafsson 1975), previous treatises
                    on binomials have been intuition-based. A glance at a general corpus, however,
                    instantly reveals a number of new and interesting facts concerning this feature.
                    Firstly, numerous paired forms emerge, which appear to have been modelled on an
                    abstract dualistic structure of the <emph rend="underscore">A + <emph
                            rend="italics">link</emph> + B type</emph>, very few of which, however,
                    represent familiar, idiomatic locutions such as the oft-quoted <emph
                        rend="italics">rough and ready</emph> and <emph rend="italics">out and
                        out</emph>: the majority of the couplets appearing in corpus data constitute
                    novel sequences such as <emph rend="italics">calm and united</emph>, <emph
                        rend="italics">gently and effectively</emph>, <emph rend="italics">inflation
                        and unemployment</emph>, etc., whose formation seems to be governed by the
                    specific lexicogrammatical, discoursal and pragmatic rules pertaining to the
                    production of the texts in which they are encountered. Secondly, although
                    couplets are extremely varied in their structural details, they all seem to fall
                    into a set of identifiable lexicogrammatical patterns. And thirdly, the
                    occurrence of the various dualistic patterns in textual sources with different
                    situational characteristics demonstrates substantial distributional
                    fluctuations.</p>
                <p>The above facts indicate that, in order to effectively account for the phenomenon
                    of binomial pairing as it is observed in a corpus of texts, a new and more
                    flexible data-driven framework needs to be devised. In the light of the data
                    used in the present research, rather than a list of structurally and
                    semantically peculiar couplets, binomials are analyzed as an abstract mechanism
                    which speakers have at their disposal for the generation of a very wide range of
                    paired types that serve a variety of important communicative purposes. As a
                    theoretical model for the identification and extraction of binomials from the
                    corpus and the classification of their various lexicogrammatical variants into a
                    set of categories, we exploit the notion of phraseological <emph rend="italics"
                        >frame</emph> or <emph rend="italics">formal idiom</emph>, as posited and
                    developed by Moon (1998:154f) and Fillmore, Kay &amp; O'Connor (1988:505f).
                    This, in very broad terms, represents an abstract structural formula which, as
                    Fillmore et al. put it, 'serves as host' (ibid.:506) to institutionalized
                    expressions as well as novel, spontaneously created forms.</p>
                <p>Binomials emerge as a major frame which can be represented by means of the
                    general formula <emph rend="italics">A link B</emph>. Our data analysis, which
                    results in the construction of a detailed and comprehensive data-driven taxonomy
                    of binomial patterns, involves, firstly, the identification and extraction of
                    the various binomial forms from our corpus of textual data; secondly, the
                    devising of a prototypical system of abstract representations to which each
                    extant pair is assigned on the basis of its lexicogrammatical attributes;
                    thirdly, the detailed recording of any interesting lexicosemantic preferences
                    displayed by the patterns (for instance their semantic prosodies; Louw 1993 and
                    Sinclair 1996); and, finally, the calculation of the frequency of occurrence of
                    each pattern in the corpus. </p>
                <p>We also discuss in detail the important but rarely addressed issue of the
                    function of binomials in the communicative process. Specifically, we examine the
                    incidence of the various binomial patterns in each of the six subcorpora
                    comprising our corpus (a set of written publications in book form, both fiction
                    and non-fiction; a broadcasting medium; a semi-specialized periodical
                    publication; two daily newspapers, a broadsheet and a tabloid; and a set of
                    spontaneous and semi-spontaneous spoken texts), and seek explanations for the
                    very substantial distributional perturbations. The main purpose of this exercise
                    is to establish the nature and extent of the correlation between the form and
                    structure of binomial patterns on the one side, and the extralinguistic and
                    situational factors pertaining to each subcorpus on the other, and, thus, to
                    determine the precise functions served by each binomial pattern in
                    communication.</p>
                <p>Our data strongly suggest that binomials constitute a phraseological device which
                    makes a highly significant contribution to the communicative process. Our
                    analysis demonstrates that, depending on their structure as well as the type of
                    text in which they are encountered, binomials serve a wide range of
                    communicative functions. For instance, it is shown that the abundant use of
                    informationally dense binomials (e.g. <emph rend="italics">government and
                        parliament</emph>, <emph rend="italics">political and monetary</emph>, <emph
                        rend="italics">commercial and investment banks</emph>) on the part of
                    journalists serves most effectively the institutional requirements of the mass
                    media for factuality, informativeness, precision, conciseness and stylistic
                    uniformity (Crystal &amp; Davy 1969, Tuchman 1978, van Dijk 1988, and
                    elsewhere), whilst simultaneously disguising the highly fragmented process of
                    production of news texts (Bell 1991).</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the frequent employment of repetitive, vague or
                    informationally sparse pairs in conversation (<emph rend="italics">ages and
                        ages</emph>, <emph rend="italics">here and there</emph>, <emph
                        rend="italics">try and get</emph>) reflects the efforts of
                    conversationalists in the face of the exigencies of real-time communication. In
                    the context of unplanned talk, binomials act as a lexicalized and, therefore,
                    elegant and well-integrated temporal space which speakers create automatically
                    and with the minimum of cognitive effort whilst coping with delays in the
                    formulation of thought and argument. Binomials in extemporaneous conversation
                    act as a crucial discourse-cohesive device, which helps keep speech 'glued
                    together' (Johnstone 1987), whilst minimizing the effect of fragmentation (Chafe
                    1982) created by phenomena such as false starts, random repetition (Norrick
                    1987), etc. At the same time, binomials may be used by speakers as a means of
                    expressing emphasis and emotional involvement and of creating rhetorical
                    presence (e.g. <emph rend="italics">faster and faster</emph>, <emph
                        rend="italics">ringing and ringing</emph>).</p>
                <p>On the whole, the corpus-based structural and situational analysis of binomials
                    not only offers new and significant information on a well-known linguistic
                    phenomenon, it also offers substantial empirical support for the hypothesis that
                    phraseology plays a major part in the accomplishment of the communicative goals
                    of speakers or writers (for a review of relevant studies, see Hatzidaki
                    1999).</p>
