                <p>Although statistical stylistics has never been a very popular area of study, it
                    is attractive because its powerful techniquesñwidely used in the sciences and
                    social sciencesñseem especially appropriate for the large amounts of information
                    that texts represent. I am working on a project that reexamines the statistical
                    techniques used by the most careful and respected of the practitioners of the
                    methodñspecifically, methods inspired by or derived from the work of John F.
                    Burrows (1987, 1989, 1992; Burrows and Hassall, 1988; Burrows and Craig, 1994;
                    Craig, 1999). Specifically, I am working with cluster analysis of the
                    frequencies of high frequency words. The high frequency and low semantic load of
                    the most frequent function words have led researchers to assume that their use
                    is likely to escape the conscious control of authors. If so, their frequencies
                    may reflect deeply ingrained linguistic habits and provide what might be called
                    ìwordprintsî for authors. If such wordprints exist, they may provide the kind of
                    objective measure of style that has been sought since the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The techniques pioneered by Burrows have been quite well received because they
                    are careful, reasonable, and compelling, and they have been extended to
                    examinations of the authorship of the Book of Mormon (Holmes, 1992), have been
                    tested on the Federalist Papers (Holmes and Forsyth, 1995), and have been
                    applied to the question of Miltonís authorship of De Doctrina Christiana
                    (Tweedie, Holmes, and Corns, 1998); see also Holmes (1994), Baayen, Van
                    Halteren, and Tweedie (1996), and Tweedie and Baayen (1998). This work tends to
                    confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of multivariate analysis in authorship
                    attribution, but in each case the field of claimants and the range of texts is
                    relatively limited. No one has taken up Burrows suggestion ìto match a natural
                    desire to work on celebrated cases like Henry VIII and The Revengerís Tragedy
                    with a more sober, though less immediately rewarding, concern for testing our
                    methods thoroughly on cases where the true answers are not in any doubtî
                    (Burrows, 1992, 174).</p>
                <p>I am interested mainly in the possible application of statistical techniques to
                    stylistic analysis, especially in the areas of character development, genre
                    definition, and stylistic variability within works or authors, but I would like
                    to demonstrate some of the work required for the task suggested by Burrows.
                    After all, only those statistical techniques that can effectively and reliably
                    distinguish known authors and known texts from each other seem likely to be
                    useful in characterizing and comparing the styles of those authors.</p>
                <p>My first experiment analyzed the first 3,000 words of opening chapters of a group
                    of 50 current novels by 27 authors, downloaded from <ptr
                        target="HTTP://WWW.CONTENTVILLE.COM"/>. My second experiment analyzed the
                    first 30,000 words of 46 novels by 31 authors, mainly taken from Hoover (1999).
                    Another experiment analyzed the 4,000-word sections of 25 pieces of current
                    literary criticism by 14 authors, downloaded from Project Muse (<ptr
                        target="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/"/>). Unfortunately, none of these
                    experiments showed the kind of results that one would hope. In fact, the best
                    result was less than 90% accurate in attributing texts to the correct authors.
                    This was true even when first and third person narration was separated and when
                    function word homographs were distinguished. Using the results of the analyses,
                    I then selected some of the most problematic texts in the second and third
                    groups for further analysis. When I analyzed the texts of only 2-4 authors,
                    cluster analysis still failed to group texts by the same author or distinguish
                    texts by different authors accurately. This lack of accuracy suggests that
                    further work is necessary before such techniques can be accepted as important
                    tools in authorship attribution or stylistic studies.</p>
                <p>In my presentation, I would like to show how the process of multivariate analysis
                    works, from the point when the texts have been collected to the production of
                    cluster graphs or PCA plots. Based on conversations with other humanities
                    computing people, I believe that there is a need for this kind of fairly
                    explicit and basic introduction to statistical analysis. At the same time, the
                    results of my experiments seem very interesting and significant in their own
                    right: although a proof of the accuracy of the techniques on large groups of
                    varied texts would have been more welcome, a demonstration of their inaccuracy
                    may, in the long run be just as useful.</p>
                <p>The main components of my own technique are TACT, used to analyze the word
                    frequencies of the individual texts and of a text that combines all of the
                    texts; FoxPro, a programmable database, used to import word frequency data, tag
                    it with author and text information, cull the data so that it includes only the
                    desired number of most frequent words (generally the 50-500 most frequent
                    words), and create zero- frequency records of frequent words that do not appear
                    in one or more of the individual texts (note: I am currently looking into the
                    feasibility of moving the techniques to Microsoft Access, with Visual Basic as
                    the programming language); and Minitab, a statistical analysis program, used to
                    perform the actual PCA and cluster analysis. The techniques I use allow for
                    quick and relatively painless analysis of many different groups of texts of many
                    different kinds, and so have the potential to provide a wide range of tests of
                    the techniques on extremely varied and extensive groups of textsñsomething that
                    has not, to my knowledge, been done before.</p>
                <p>For my poster presentation, I would need access to a PC running Windows 98 (NOT
                    2000 or MEñI need access to DOS, for running batch files), on which I could
                    install Foxpro (Access might be needed, if I get the conversion done in time),
                    Minitab, TACT, and a bunch of texts for possible analysis.</p>
