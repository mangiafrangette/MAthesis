                    <head>Introduction</head>
                    <p>The estimate of costs of a digitization project is a very difficult task, to
                        say the least. It is difficult to make exact estimates beforehand due to the
                        great quantity of unknown factors. However, the common practice when signing
                        digitization agreements is to set a firm commitment before beginning the
                        works so much concerning economic costs as in terms of time lapses and
                        deadlines. In the same way as for software development projects an incorrect
                        estimate of times and costs produce delays.</p>
                    <p>Based on methods used for cost prediction in Software Engineering like CoCoMo
                        (Constructive Cost Model; Boehm, 1981) and Function Points (Albrecht, 1981),
                        and using historical data gathered in almost three years of existence of our
                        digital library, we have developed a model for digitization cost estimates
                        (DiCoMo, Digitization Cost Model) for text digitization projects in general.</p>
                    <p>This method can be adapted to different production processes, like the
                        production of digital texts using scanning plus OCR and human proofreading,
                        or the production of digital facsimiles (scanning without OCR). The estimate
                        done a priori is improved as the project evolves by adjustments done with
                        real data obtained from previous stages. Each estimate is a refinement
                        obtained as a result of the work developed so far.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Factors that affect digitization costs</head>
                    <p>There are many factors that affect the cost of production of a digital
                        object. Both these factors and their effect on costs are difficult to be
                        determined and have to be carefully studied. Among them, we can highlight
                        the individual capacities of the persons assigned to the project and their
                        familiarity with the specific characteristics of the work to be digitally
                        published, its complexity, size, demanded level of quality, the technology
                        used and the familiarity with the computer tools to be used.</p>
                    <p>Main Factors that influence digitization costs: <list type="bulleted">
                            <item>Size of the material to publish</item>
                            <item>Complexity of the task</item>
                            <item>Individual capacity of editors, correctors and scanner-operators</item>
                            <item>Special quality requests</item>
                            <item>Technological level of the environment</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The assigned time impacts mainly in the quality of the product obtained which
                        is notably lowered when the times assigned are unreally short and they force
                        the technicians to work under excessive pressure. This is particularly true
                        for the correction and editing process, where text output from OCR has to be
                        carefully proofread and corrected. This is a delicate craft that takes time
                        and cannot be done under excessive pressure since when it is not properly
                        done obliges to further revision and corrections that have a very negative
                        impact on costs with a final result that turns out to be worse than the time
                        initially saved. Next each one of these factors is described.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Size of the material to publish</head>
                    <p>Digitization projects, compared to software design projects, have the
                        advantage that we know beforehand the size of the work to be done (namely
                        the number of pages or words to digitize).</p>
                    <p>The first and easiest way to determine the raw size of a text to be digitized
                        is to count the pages. But pages are not equally dense for all books. We can
                        have an approach to the density by counting the words that fit in a standard
                        page, or the words that fit in a fixed size window, and then assuming that
                        the rest of the pages are similar in this respect.</p>
                    <p>To count individual words would be more accurate, but not a practical
                        approach at all. Anyway, after the OCR process takes place we will obtain a
                        text file, with errors of course, but nevertheless a text file where we can
                        automatically count the number of words or the size in bytes to have a
                        better measure of the amount of proofread and correction work that comes
                        ahead. So this second measure of the size serves to adjust the initial
                        estimates for higher accuracy.</p>

                    <head>Complexity of the task</head>
                    <p>This is by far the most significant modifier concerning cost estimates. In
                        fact, there are many complexity factors that affect each stage of the
                        development process. In the case of the correction stage, which we consider
                        the most critical one, there are various factor to take into
                            consideration:<list type="bulleted">
                            <item>the type of text (prose, verse, drama written in prose, drama
                                written in verse, dictionary)</item>
                            <item>footnotes if the number is too high</item>
                            <item>quotations in foreign or classical languages (if too many)</item>
                            <item>the complexity of the author style and vocabulary</item>
                            <item>the quality of the OCR output (few or lots of errors) </item>
                            <item>the legibility of the paper copy used as original</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Concerning markup, complexity varies according to the number and difficulty
                        of the tags to added. Drama, for instance, with the need of a <emph
                            rend="italics">castlist</emph>, <emph rend="italics"> speaker</emph> and
                            <emph rend="italics">speeches</emph>, requires an additional tagging
                        effort. Verse with split lines is another case of added complexity since
                        special care needs to be taken to assign attribute values to declare which
                        part (initial, middle, or final) of the split line of verse is which.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the production of digital facsimiles from manuscripts, a case
                        of extra complexity is when we have to work on rare and valuable originals
                        that have to be handled with special care (wearing rubber gloves for
                        instance) and using a digital photographic camera instead of a flat bed
                        scanner. On the contrary, digitizing unbounded pages using a flat bed
                        scanner with automatic page feeder would be the easiest case.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Individual capacity of the technicians</head>
                    <p>In the computer programmers world, individual productivity has been measured
                        extensively. Harold Sackman and collaborators, carried out an experiment in
                        1968 where they made evident that performance differences registered in
                        individual programmers were much bigger that those attributed to the effect
                        of the working environment. The difference between the best and the worst
                        performance was very high, being the experience a decisive factor. In a
                        later experiment, Sackman observed a variation in the productivity of as
                        much as 16 to 1 (Sackman, 1968). DeMarco and Lister also discuss the effects
                        of a well integrated group to enhance productivity in their book Peopleware
                        (Demarco+Lister, 1987).</p>
                    <p>Now back in the field of electronic editing, the results that we have
                        measured comparing correctors performance in tasks of correction of texts
                        output from OCR show us differences in productivity of as much as three to
                        one, depending on the individual ability and speed of correctors. Variations
                        in productivity of this magnitude are significant for cost estimates, so
                        including a parameter to adjust the estimates according to individual skills
                        seemed to be necessary.</p>

                    <head>Special quality requests</head>
                    <p>Producing a modernized digital edition from an ancient text takes additional
                        time and effort compared to processing a modern text, since modernization is
                        a complex task that involves difficult decisions. Using Madison markup for
                        the transcription of a manuscript is another example of additional requested
                        complexity. So is the case of making high legible digital facsimiles of
                        ancient manuscripts, where special care and fine-tuning of the scanning
                        properties may be needed.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Technological level of the environment</head>
                    <p>This is a relevant issue when using different technologies or migrating from
                        old to new production tools. When the environment is stable and well known,
                        and the estimate equations are well adjusted for it, there is no need to
                        care of this issue. Changes in technology, however, will surely requiere
                        modifications to the equations.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Cost estimation models</head>
                    <p>According to R. Fairley (Fairley, 1985), inside most organizations, the
                        estimation of production costs is usually based on past experiences.
                        Historical data are used to identify the cost factors and to determine their
                        relative importance within the organization. The above-mentioned, is the
                        reason for current project's production costs data to be stored for later
                        use.</p>
                    <p>We can classify cost estimation methods in two broad categories depending on
                        whether the approach goes from the general to the specific (top-down) or the
                        other way around (bottom-up). Top-down models first consider the costs at
                        the most general level, being usually based on the exam of the costs of
                        previous similar projects. Bottom-up models first consider the development
                        cost of each module which are then added to obtain the total cost. This
                        technique concentrates on the costs associated with the independent
                        development of each module or individual component of the project and we
                        believe that it is the most appropriate for digitization projects of
                        literary works. It can lead to errors if the time spent in some parallel
                        tasks like version control, backup copies, digital preservation and quality
                        control is not taken into account. The bigger the project, the more
                        important these factors become.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Expert judgement</head>
                    <p>A top down technique frequently used to estimate costs is based on expert
                        judgement. Expert judgement is based on experience, on previous knowledge
                        and on the commercial sense of one or more individuals inside the
                        organization (Fairley, 1985). According to Fairley, the biggest advantage of
                        expert judgement which is experience, can end up being its weakness. The
                        expert can trust that a project is similar to a previous one, but it can
                        happen that he/she has forgotten some factors that make the new task
                        significantly different. To compensate for this, and for a possible lack of
                        experience in a particular project type, a group instead of individual
                        experts are used to try to arrive to a consent. The purpose is to minimize
                        individual flaws and the lack of familiarity with some kind of projects,
                        neutralizing personal tendencies.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>The DELFI method</head>
                    <p>The DELFI method is a group expert judgement method that tries to minimize
                        the interpersonal influences in a groups that may spoil the final
                        estimation. The DELFI technique was developed at the Rand corporation in
                        1948, with the purpose of obtaining the consent of a group of experts
                        without having the negative effects of group meetings (Helmer, 1966). This
                        technique has been adapted to estimate costs in the following way (see
                        Fairley, 1985):<list>
                            <item>1. A coordinator gives the documentation with the description of
                                the project to each expert and a form to write his/her estimate.</item>
                            <item>2. Each expert studies the definition and anonymously determines
                                his/her estimation. The experts can consult the coordinator, but not
                                another expert.</item>
                            <item>3. The coordinator prepares and distributes a summary of the
                                estimates done so far.</item>
                            <item>4. The experts carry out a second round of anonymous estimates,
                                using the results of the previous one. In the case that an estimate
                                differs much from the others, an anonymous justification by the
                                expert that made it may be requested.</item>
                            <item>5. The process is repeated as many times as it is considered
                                necessary, avoiding group discussions.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>It is possible that after several rounds of estimates there is no consent. In
                        this case, the coordinator will study the causes of such disagreements and
                        try to solve the differences, sometimes by adding new information.</p>
                    <p>In our case we have preferred not to use this type of expertise based
                        estimation methods, but to take advantage of the expert knowledge to
                        determine the factors that have a significant influence on production times.
                        For digitization costs estimation we preferred to use bottom-up methods,
                        preferably algorithm-based ones, as we explain below.</p>

                    <p>Work breakdown structure or WBS, is a top-down method that helps to plan a
                        project. A work breakdown structure is a hierarchical flowchart where the
                        different parts of a project are established reflecting a hierarchy of
                        products and processes. A WBS flowchart of processes identifies the work
                        activities and their interrelations. Using the WBS technique, the total cost
                        of the project is calculated by adding the costs of the individual
                        components in the flowchart.</p>

                    <p>With algorithm-based cost models the costs are calculated by adding the costs
                        of each of the modules or subparts of the project in a bottom-up fashion.
                        The constructive cost model or COCOMO is a cost model based on algorithms
                        described by B. Boehm (Boehm, 1981).</p>
                    <p>According to Pressman (Pressman, 1988), the equations for Basic-COCOMO are
                        the following:<lb/><emph rend="bold">
                            <formula>E = a KLOC^^b</formula>
                        </emph><lb/><emph rend="bold">
                            <formula>M = c E^^d</formula>
                        </emph><lb/>where <emph rend="bold">E</emph> is the effort applied in
                        persons-month, <emph rend="bold">M</emph> is the development time in
                        chronological months, and <emph rend="bold">KLOC</emph> are the estimated
                        number of lines of code (in thousands). The factors <emph rend="bold"
                        >a</emph>, <emph rend="bold">b</emph>, <emph rend="bold">c</emph> and <emph
                            rend="bold">d</emph> are from a table given by B. Boehm. This values are
                        for estimating software production costs, and are irrelevant for our
                        purpose. We will only take the spirit of COCOMO and adapt it to estimate
                        digitization costs.</p>
                    <p>Intermediate-COCOMO takes the following form:<lb/><emph rend="bold">
                            <formula>E = a KLOC^^b EAF</formula>
                        </emph><lb/>where a new <emph rend="italics">effort adjusting factor</emph>
                        is added. This factor is obtained by first evaluating a set of complexity
                        factors and then extracting the value EAF from a table. Basically, EAF is a
                        value close to 1 that adjust the resulting effort calculation according to
                        the overall complexity determined by various features of the project. Is
                        usually a value between 0.70 and 1.65.</p>
                    <p>In our digitization cost model (DiCoMo), we use a basic equation similar to
                        Basic-COCOMO, but with an added fixed value <emph rend="bold">f</emph>:<lb/>
                        <emph rend="bold">
                            <formula>H = a P^^b + f</formula>
                        </emph></p>
                    <p>We do not have to estimate the size (in pages) <emph rend="bold">P</emph>
                        which is known beforehand. We directly calculate the number of hours <emph
                            rend="bold">H</emph>. We add a fixed value <emph rend="bold">f</emph>
                        which stands for the fixed time necessary for the type of task considered,
                        independent of the size of the task. An example of this is the time needed
                        to adjust the scanning software parameters, which is a fixed time which does
                        not depend on the number of pages to be scanned later.</p>
                    <p>For an example of this Basic-DiCoMo approach, see figure 1, where an
                        estimation curve (thick line) approaches real data spots (black squares)
                        that represent real measures from the correction stage. The thin straight
                        line represent a linear approach to the spots, while the curve represents
                        the following estimation equation which gives us the estimated number of
                        hours to correct a text given the number of pages:<lb/><emph rend="bold">
                            <formula>H = 0.0653 P^^2,091 + 8</formula>

                    <p>This simplistic approach doesn't take into account the fact that different

                        proofreading. This differences in complexity is due to several facts. We
                        have detected the most important ones and added a complexity adjustment

                    <p>Many studies have attempted to relate size oriented methods like COCOMO and

                        (Albrecht, 1981), the idea of modularization according to functions. In our
                        case we consider each production step a functional unit, for which the
                        estimation equation is applied.</p>

                    <head>Conclusions</head>
                    <p>We have designed a cost estimation model for digitization projects based on
                        known software engineering cost models. These methods allowed us to predict
                        the overall time a digitization project would take within a 20% error range.</p>
                    <p>Digitization projects, compared to software design projects, have the
                        advantage that we know beforehand the size of the work to be done (namely
                        the number of pages or words to digitize). In software engineering we can
                        only guess the total number of lines of code or function points a project
                        will take, and the certainty of the cost estimates will depend largely on
                        this preliminary size estimate.</p>
                    <p>We verified that the model we propose works well in practice, and can be
                        easily applied to different digital production processes, but the cost
                        equation needs to be fine-tuned in advance for the model to be applied. This
                        requires two things to be done first: on one hand the main objective factors
                        that affect the time required to do the work must be determined and weighed,
                        and on the other hand sufficient historical data must be gathered to
                        fine-tune the parameters of the cost equation. Having this information a
                        cost-equation for the specific production process is easily obtained.</p>
                    <p>Good expert knowledge of the process facilitates the fine-tuning task and
                        allows for better estimation equations. Nevertheless, the cost-equations can
                        be dynamically improved by re-adjusting the parameters with the new data
                        fed-back from new projects. In this way the estimation model can be
                        incrementally improved.</p>
