                <p>Markup is inserted into textual material not at random, but to convey some
                    meaning. An author may supply markup as part of the act of composing a text; in
                    this case the markup expresses the author's intentions. The author creates
                    certain textual structures simply by tagging them; the markup has performative
                    significance. In other cases, markup is supplied as part of the transcription in
                    electronic form of pre-existing material. In such cases, markup reflects the
                    understanding of the text held by the transcriber; we say that the markup
                    expresses a claim about the text.</p>
                <p>In the one case, markup is constitutive of the meaning; in the other, it is
                    interpretive. In each case, the reader (for all practical purposes, readers
                    include software which processes marked up documents) may legitimately use the
                    markup to make inferences about the structure and properties of the text. For
                    this reason, we say that markup licenses certain inferences about the text.</p>
                <p>If markup has meaning, it seems fair to ask how to identify the meaning of the
                    markup used in a document, and how to document the meaning assigned to
                    particular markup constructs by specifications of markup languages (e.g. by DTDs
                    and their documentation).</p>
                <p>In this paper, we propose an account of how markup licenses inferences, and how
                    to tell, for a given marked up text, what inferences are actually licensed by
                    its markup. As a side effect, we will also provide an account of what is needed
                    in a specification of the meaning of a markup language. We begin by proposing a
                    simple method of expressing the meaning of SGML or XML element types and
                    attributes; we then identify a fundamental distinction between distributive and
                    sortal features of texts, which affects the interpretation of markup. We
                    describe a simple model of interpretation for markup, and note various ways in
                    which it must be refined in order to handle standard patterns of usage in
                    existing markup schemes; this allows us to define a simple measure of
                    complexity, which allows direct comparison of the complexity of different ways
                    of expressing the same information (i.e. licensing the same inferences) about a
                    given text, using markup.</p>
                <p>For simplicity, we formulate our discussion in terms of SGML or XML markup,
                    applied to documents or texts. Similar arguments can be made for other uses of
                    SGML and XML, and may be possible for some other families of markup
                    language.</p>
                <p>Related work has been done by Simons (in the context of translating between
                    marked up texts and database systems), Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard (in an
                    informal introduction to the TEI), Langendoen and Simons (also with respect to
                    the TEI), Huitfeldt and others in Bergen (in discussions of the Wittgenstein
                    Archive at the University of Bergen, and in critiques of SGML), Renear and
                    others at Brown University, and Welty and Ide (in a description of systems which
                    draw inferences from markup). Much of this earlier work, however, has focused on
                    questions of subjectivity and objectivity in text markup, or on the nature of
                    text, and the like. The approach taken in this paper is somewhat more formal,
                    while still much less formal and rigorous than that taken by Wadler in his
                    recent work on XSLT.</p>
                <p>Let us begin with a concrete example. Among the papers of the American historical
                    figure Henry Laurens is a draft Laurens prepared of a letter to be sent from the
                    Commons House of Assembly of South Carolina to the royal governor, Lord William
                    Campbell, in 1775. Some words have lines through them, and others written above
                    the line. The editors of Laurens's papers interpret the lines through words as
                    cancellations, and the words above the lines as insertions; an electronic
                    version of the document using TEI markup and reflecting these interpretations,
                    might read thus:<lb/>
                    <eg>&lt;P&gt;&lt;DEL&gt;It was be&lt;/DEL&gt; &lt;DEL&gt;For&lt;/DEL&gt; When we
                        applied to Your Excellency for leave to adjourn it was because we foresaw
                        that we &lt;DEL&gt;were&lt;/DEL&gt; &lt;ADD&gt;should continue&lt;/ADD&gt;
                        wasting our own time ... &lt;/P&gt;</eg></p>
                <p>From the DEL elements, the reader of the document is licensed to infer that the
                    letters "It was be", "For", and "were" are marked as deleted; from the ADD
                    element, the reader may infer that the words "should continue" have been added.
                    Software might rely on these inferences in the course of making a concordance or
                    displaying a clear text; human readers will rely on them in interpreting the
                    historical document. Note that the markup here stops short of licensing the
                    inference that "should continue" was substituted for "were". The editors could
                    license that inference as well by appropriate markup, if they wished. Human
                    readers may make the inference on their own, given the linguistic context;
                    software cannot safely infer a substitution every time an addition is adjacent
                    to a deletion.</p>
                <p>A simple way to capture the meaning of markup is to define, for each markup
                    construct, a set of open sentences - sentences with unbound variables - which
                    express the inferences licensed by the use of that construct. In formal
                    reasoning, such open sentences may be transformed into logical predicates in the
                    usual way.</p>
                <p>For example, the TEI element type DEL is said by the documentation to mark "a
                    letter, word or passage deleted, marked as deleted, or otherwise indicated as
                    superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, annotator or
                    corrector" (TEI P3, p. 922). We take this to mean that when a DEL element is
                    encountered in a document, the reader is licensed to infer that the material so
                    marked has been deleted. In formal contexts, we may write "deleted(X)"; we can
                    specify the meaning of the DEL element and of the logical predicate "deleted(X)"
                    by means of an open sentence: "X has been deleted, or marked as deleted, or ..."
                    etc. The variable X is to be bound, in practice, to the contents of the DEL
                    element. If we imagine a variable named 'this', instantiated to each element of
                    a document in turn, and a function 'contents' which returns the contents of its
                    argument, then the meaning of the DEL element becomes
                    "deleted(contents(this)))", or equivalently "contents(this) has been deleted
                    ..." etc.</p>
                <p>The TEI element type HI, similarly, "marks [its contents] as graphically distinct
                    from the surrounding text" (TEI P3, p. 1013). We can capture the meaning of HI
                    by the open sentence "X is graphically distinct from the surrounding text", or
                    "highlighted(X)", where X is, as before, to be replaced by "contents(this)".</p>
                <p>Attributes may be treated similarly. The 'rend' attribute on the &lt;hi&gt;
                    element "describes the rendition or presentation of the word or phrase
                    highlighted". In the example<lb/><eg>&lt;P&gt;&lt;HI REND="gothic"&gt;And this
                        Indenture further witnesseth&lt;/HI&gt; that the said &lt;HI
                        REND="italic"&gt;Walter Shandy&lt;/HI&gt;, merchant, in consideration of the
                        said intended marriage ... &lt;/P&gt;</eg><lb/> the HI elements convey the
                    information that the contents of those elements are distinct from their
                    surroundings, while the 'rend' attributes on the HI elements specify how. The
                    meaning of the 'rend' attribute is expressed by the open sentence "X is rendered
                    in style Y." An HI element with a 'rend' attribute thus means "X is graphically
                    distinct from its surroundings, and X is rendered in style Y".</p>
                <p>Perhaps the simplest method of interpreting markup is to assume that<list>
                        <item>1. The meaning of every element type is expressed by an open sentence
                            whose single unbound variable is to be bound to 'contents(this)'.</item>
                        <item>2. The meaning of every attribute is expressed by an open sentence
                            with two unbound variables, one of which is to be bound to
                            'contents(this)' and the other to 'value(this,attribute-name)' (i.e. to
                            the value of the attribute in question). In other words, each attribute
                            defines some relation R which holds between the contents of the element
                            and the value of the attribute.</item>
                        <item>3. All inferences licensed by any two elements are compatible.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>The set of inferences applicable to any given location L is then the union of the
                    inferences licensed by all the elements within which L is contained. Let us call
                    this the 'union model' of interpretation.</p>
                <p>The union model is simple, and provides a good first approximation of the rules
                    of inference for marked up text. But it is not wholly adequate.</p>
                <p>First, it fails to distinguish distributed properties (such as 'italic' or
                    'highlighted') from sortal properties (such as paragraphs, sections, or - as
                    illustrated above - deletion). It is as true to say "The word 'And' is in
                    black-letter" as to say it of the entire phrase, and the meaning of the example
                    given above would not change if the HI elements were split into two or more
                    adjacent pieces each with the same 'rend' value. Conversely, two HI elements
                    with the same attribute values can be merged without changing the meaning of the
                    markup. Other elements mark properties which are NOT distributed equally among
                    the contents, and cannot be split or joined without changing the meaning of the
                    markup. From the markup<lb/><eg>&lt;P&gt;Reader, I married
                    him.&lt;/P&gt;</eg><lb/>we can infer the existence of one paragraph, but we
                    cannot infer that "Reader" is itself a paragraph. Such properties we call
                    'sortal' properties, borrowing a term of art from linguistics. Elements marking
                    sortals are usefully countable; those marking distributed properties are
                    not.</p>
                <p>Second, the union model fails to allow a correct interpretation of inherited
                    values and overrides, as illustrated by the TEI 'lang' attribute or the xml:lang
                    attribute of XML. In fact, some inferences do contradict each other, and
                    specifications of the meaning of markup need to say which inferences are
                    compatible, and which are in conflict, and how to adjudicate conflicts.</p>
                <p>Third, the union model allows inferences about a location L only on the basis of
                    markup on open elements (those which contain L); in order to handle common
                    idioms of SGML and XML, a model of interpretation must handle<list
                        type="bulleted">
                        <item>upward propagation: the meaning of an element may depend in part on
                            its contents; this is unusual in colloquial SGML/XML systems, but is a
                            regular feature of proposals to eliminate attributes from markup
                            languages.</item>
                        <item>context dependency: the meaning of an element may depend on its
                            context; trivial examples include TEI's HI and FOREIGN, which can mean
                            'not-Roman' and 'not-English' in one context, and 'not-italic' and
                            'not-German' in others.</item>
                        <item>ordinal position, relative or absolute; dependence of meaning upon
                            ordinal position is seldom an explicit feature of markup languages, but
                            dependence of processing based on position is a standard feature of

                        <item>milestone elements; these convey information by position in the
                            beginning-to-end scan of the linear form of the document, rather than by

                        <item>linking: out-of-line or 'standoff' markup conveys information about
                            location L based not only on open elements, but on elements which point
                            at L or some ancestor of L.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Other methods of associating markup with meaning are imaginable, but we believe a
                    survey of existing DTDs will show that all or virtually all current practice is
                    covered by any model of interpretation which encompasses the complications just
                    outlined.</p>
                <p>Essentially, these can be handled by extending the rules for binding variables in
                    the open sentences which specify the meaning of a given markup construct. The
                    simple union model allows only 'contents(this)' and
                    'value(this,attribute-name)'; the constructs listed above require more complex
                    expressions, roughly equivalent in expressiveness to the TEI extended-pointer
                    notation or to the patterns of the XPath language defined by W3C.</p>
                <p>Complexity of the semantics associated with an element type or attribute may be
                    measured by the number of unbound variables in the open slots, by the complexity
                    of the expressions which are to fill them, and by the amount or kind of memory
                    required to allow full generation of the inferences licensed by markup in a
                    particular text.</p>
