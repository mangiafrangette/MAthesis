<p><span class="font2">New literacy is not to be taken as merely a change in how we understand and present information because of newly-developed technologies, but as a way of&nbsp;transforming how we interact with texts and with the&nbsp;world as a whole. This study aims to report an empirical study on how four types of digital natives, all born&nbsp;in the 1980s, access information and create content.&nbsp;Data was collected through one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 28 writers, illustrators, social innovators, and makers in total, seven in each category.&nbsp;The data were then processed as follows: First, we employed qualitative analysis and interpretation through&nbsp;close readings and meaning-making. Second, we quantitatively deconstructed the text by atomizing the discourse with Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing (CKIP) and filtering out units that are irrelevant to the analysis. Finally, we generated comparisons&nbsp;among the four contemporary groups and their new&nbsp;literacy practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Writers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In contrast to their counterparts from the older generation who were devoted to a single identity such&nbsp;as being a novelist, columnist, or essayist, young creative writers who have won literature awards and published top-ranking books grew up within a social environment of PTT, blogs, and Facebook. They are accustomed to managing their primary literate role while at&nbsp;the same time enjoying multi-tasking by being active&nbsp;across new media platforms and acting as popular&nbsp;commentators for social issues related to their academic training such as education, sociology, gender&nbsp;study, and philosophy. They obtain a vast quantity of&nbsp;high quality information from their social media stratosphere and they share opinions and ideas through social media services with their followers as a form of&nbsp;self-presentation, or “performance” in Goffman's term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Illustrators</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Internet and social media has brought changes to people's reading habits in many ways; for example,&nbsp;“Picture Reading” and illustrated creative blogs have&nbsp;become very popular in Taiwan over the last decade.&nbsp;Therefore, illustrators who devote effort to character&nbsp;creation and social media fan page management are&nbsp;increasing in number. They obtain inspiration from&nbsp;daily life and can transform their observations into&nbsp;creative content. These illustrators integrate their interests and capacities to share their artwork on the Internet, and they attempt to develop a business model&nbsp;that involves a multivariate form of production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Social innovators</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Social innovators attempt to employ strategies and actions to solve community or city problems through&nbsp;teamwork with the goal of making the world a better&nbsp;place. They use technology as a means of connecting&nbsp;resources in the process. Their goal is to penetrate social problems and issues, identify the needs of communities they target, develop innovative solutions, and&nbsp;take action. One of their primary strategies for achieving this goal is to collaborate with local people to create stories for the public, who thus can understand the&nbsp;value and meaning behind these stories. Their storytelling is multimodal in nature to accommodate the&nbsp;needs of the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Makers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “maker movement” has emerged in Taiwan over the last several years, and under the social environment of learning by doing, makers create a small&nbsp;amount of delicate products and are very open regarding sharing their ideas and creative processes. They&nbsp;suggest that traditional education in Taiwan neglects&nbsp;the significance of DIY and are enthusiastic about the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">culture of makers, who emphasize learning, doing, and sharing. They are very persistent about their own interests, and empower themselves with knowledge and&nbsp;skills through self-directed learning, pursuing an ideal&nbsp;living style and working arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Insight from word clouds and the co-occurrence of key words</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The word clouds of writers illuminate a central focus is on words, articles and literature. The literacy practice of these writers is to express feelings and provide arguments about issues. By contrast, illustrators&nbsp;are interest-driven; they enjoy sharing life stories and&nbsp;ideas with their friends, and are followed by social media fans who adore the characters they have created.&nbsp;The central focus of social innovators is on society,&nbsp;community, and local issues and needs; and their resources and contributions include teamwork, space,&nbsp;activities, cultural artifacts, and communication between people and the government. Finally, makers are&nbsp;interest-driven and they enjoy sharing life experiences&nbsp;through their creations and products like illustrators.&nbsp;Much like social innovators, makers access information and create content in both the cyber world and&nbsp;in the physical world.</span></p>
