<p><span class="font4">The panel contributions will introduce and discuss several central aspects of DARIAH-EU aimed to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">support emerging practices in the Digital Humanities, to disseminate consolidated practices and to provide tools for navigation through the rich and&nbsp;changing landscape of the productions of research&nbsp;communities, be they research data, tools, methods&nbsp;or other assets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our focus point is how to boost research on a number of different levels: ensuring the sustainability of the infrastructure, its “scaling up” to enable&nbsp;better access to research data, community-building,&nbsp;linking teaching activities and weaving the network&nbsp;of affiliated initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Panel Overview</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chad Gaffield (Moderator)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Panel participants as listed below will introduce their topic for 5 minutes each, followed by a general discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been much debated in the Digital Humanities communities whether scaling up - in terms of shared resources, formation of team science, crossdomain research - is at all appropriate for the way&nbsp;knowledge is produced in the various humanistic&nbsp;disciplines. Instead of tackling again this general&nbsp;problem, this panel takes a much more practical approach. There can be no doubt that research practices in the humanities and social sciences are profoundly changing (Wouters et al., 2013). The turn to&nbsp;digital methods happens in a relationship of mutual&nbsp;dependency and co-evolution with the infrastructures traditionally feeding humanities research: collections, libraries and archives. This development is&nbsp;most visible in large-scale research infrastructures&nbsp;such as CLARIN and DARIAH, and it is acknowledged&nbsp;by their respective funding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This panel presents the efforts made within the DARIAH (</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts&nbsp;and Humanities</span><span class="font4">) community in its mission to further&nbsp;develop the Arts and Humanities research infrastructure, now that the Digital Humanities have long&nbsp;left the incubation stage or the phase of early&nbsp;adopters. The field is still growing but also starting&nbsp;to differentiate and specialise. The “scaling up” of the&nbsp;humanities refers to the growth of the community -as a social, cognitive and technological network -,&nbsp;the increasing availability of Big Data, the ongoing&nbsp;penetration of standards and the use of consolidated&nbsp;tools. While the mission is quite clear, its implementation is a far more complex process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We will focus on the relevance of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">community </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sustainability </span><span class="font4">as driving factors in building the&nbsp;research infrastructure</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font4">The contributions report&nbsp;about lessons learned, examine achievements and&nbsp;open questions, and aim to engage with the audience&nbsp;about their expectations, experiences and visions of&nbsp;what a research infrastructure (RI) for the Arts and&nbsp;Humanities should look like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two aspects are not arbitrary. Communitybuilding responds to the motto of DARIAH: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">services developed for researchers by researchers</span><span class="font4"> and is relevant to formulate needs, to find appropriate technical solutions but also to encourage continuous&nbsp;(re)use by means of education and training. DARIAH&nbsp;itself is a pan-European infrastructure, driven by&nbsp;grass-rooted needs of researchers, and governed by&nbsp;national representatives, entailing processes of collaborative evaluation. In addition to communitybuilding within the RI, DARIAH has always aimed to&nbsp;expand and strengthen the external cooperations&nbsp;with a broader ecosystem involving both affiliated RI&nbsp;projects (EHRI, CENDARI, PARTHENOS) and sister&nbsp;initiatives like CLARIN, as well as with research infrastructures that specialize in providing basic services (eduGain, EGI or EUDAT). Research Infrastructures address both their users and producers with&nbsp;their immediate needs. At the same time they have&nbsp;to be stable, reliable and of good quality, which needs&nbsp;to be addressed continuously throughout its life. Another primary concern of DARIAH is the focus on reuse of research data and ensuring their longevity.&nbsp;This is where the sustainability of software and services comes into play, ensuring the continued availability of the outputs from shorter-lived projects in&nbsp;the long run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Building a durable infrastructure</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nicolas Larrousse and Paulin Ribbe</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the last decades, digital made his way into the Arts and Humanities research world at every&nbsp;stage of research projects. As a consequence, the way&nbsp;researchers work today has considerably evolved.&nbsp;They can no longer work isolated and their work requires more and more sophisticated tools to deal&nbsp;with research material. There is a need to scale up&nbsp;and build infrastructures dedicated to Arts and Humanities. DARIAH is one possible answer to these&nbsp;new requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">DARIAH is organized as an European framework for research infrastructures based upon a consortium of states which agree to support the infrastructure in the long term. It was designed to establish&nbsp;sustainable digital services and develop common&nbsp;practices. Such objectives reflect a long-term vision&nbsp;which would not fit in a “classical” project funded for&nbsp;three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within the consortium, ongoing efforts help to concretely build the infrastructure and to better answer those fundamental questions: what is an infrastructure for Arts and Humanities and how can we&nbsp;build it on the European level?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DARIAH contributions and the reference architecture they inhabit</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mike Priddy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Co-authors: Francesca Morse</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i, Lisa de Leeuw, Andrea Scharnhorst)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">DARIAH constitutes itself as a pan-European infrastructure and relies on national contributions from its member states. 90% of these contributions&nbsp;are in-kind and represent the research outputs that&nbsp;each member country contributes to the infrastructure, showing the richness and diversity of the European research landscape. DARIAH is creating a way&nbsp;to collect, disseminate, review, assess and evaluate&nbsp;the contributions made to the infrastructure and&nbsp;community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As researchers in the Arts and Humanities familiarise with the creation, management, storage and reuse of data, they need a technical infrastructure that can support such activities. On the other hand, a&nbsp;mere technical support seems insufficient to sustain&nbsp;their research activities, as research communities&nbsp;play a crucial role in the development of the infrastructure by developing processes and offering services and resources. An approach which supports&nbsp;the knowledge creation process as well as an agreement on standardised processes (e.g. data exchange)&nbsp;is therefore highly needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With a reference architecture we aim to create a common language among the European member&nbsp;countries per individual type of contribution to describe and communicate DARIAH contributions, as&nbsp;well as provide a reference for other projects and infrastructures in the Arts and Humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Re-usability of tools and services</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carsten Thiel</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The software tools and solutions powering the services provided by infrastructures are subject to&nbsp;their individual life cycles. While most projects realised through research grants focus on the initial</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">phases - from inception and initial design, through user testing and design revisions, to beta releases -,&nbsp;delivering a “final” product by the project's end remains the primary objective. But the software's life&nbsp;does not end there. As researchers use the tools, new&nbsp;needs and requirements can arise that need to be addressed and implemented. At the same time the IT&nbsp;world evolves and technologies change. This leads to&nbsp;an increased need for adopting existing services and&nbsp;their underlying software for continued usability.&nbsp;Finding resources to sustain the services and to ensure their availability and accessibility requires a&nbsp;change already to the initial objectives in the development phase (see Doorn, Aerts, Lusher 2016). Designing software from the get-go with re-usability in&nbsp;mind ensures the long-term benefit of enabling future contributions and adoptions needed by the&nbsp;community as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching: where and how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Au re lien Berra</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">DARIAH's “Research and Education” programme has contributed or planned several services which&nbsp;emphasize how data are central in building up a&nbsp;sense of community and deliberate, open, collaborative research strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three projects will be discussed. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Digital Humanities Course Registry</span><span class="font4"> is a collaborative database aiming to provide up-to-date information on European courses to students looking for a programme and to&nbsp;teachers and researchers interested in evaluating&nbsp;the state of the field at a national or international&nbsp;level. The initiatives comprised in the “Integration of&nbsp;Training Material” project offer a framework for&nbsp;sharing and preserving Digital Humanities teaching&nbsp;materials (through the user-centred design of #dari-ahTeach, an open platform for extensible and translatable contents, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://dariah.eu/teach)_as_well_as_aphilological_toolbox_based_on_the_principle_of_re-useand_adaption_(Biblissima's_BaOBab,_a_catalogue_ofonline_tools,_guidelines_and_tutorials_focused_onmanuscripts_traditions,_http://outils.biblissima.fr).The_Master_Classes_scheduled_for_2017_in_Maynooth(Public_Humanities),_Florence_(Evaluating_DigitalScholarship),_Berlin_and_Paris_(Data_Reuse_in_the_Humanities)_are_designed_as_experiments_in_developinga_format_which_will_engage_advanced_users_and_foster_a_collective_reflection_on_%e2%80%9cdata_fluidity%e2%80%9d_(see_Ro-mary,_Mertens_&amp;_Baillot_2016">http://dariah.eu/teach</span><span class="font4">) as well as a&nbsp;philological toolbox based on the principle of re-use&nbsp;and adaption (Biblissima's BaOBab, a catalogue of&nbsp;online tools, guidelines and tutorials focused on&nbsp;manuscripts traditions, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://outils.biblissima.fr</span><span class="font4">).&nbsp;The Master Classes scheduled for 2017 in Maynooth&nbsp;(Public Humanities), Florence (Evaluating Digital&nbsp;Scholarship), Berlin and Paris (Data Reuse in the Humanities) are designed as experiments in developing&nbsp;a format which will engage advanced users and foster a collective reflection on “data fluidity” (see Ro-mary, Mertens &amp; Baillot 2016</a>).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DARIAH &amp; affiliates (aka “DARIAH's outer network”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matej Durco</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the vast diversity of the individual research agendas, at a certain level all research infrastructures and initiatives need the same kind of basic facilities represented by the lower levels of the architectural stacks - stable hosting and storage of data,&nbsp;processing and computational capacity, secure authentication to build trust, stable referencing of resources, etc. DARIAH has always embraced the idea&nbsp;of cooperation between the different initiatives to&nbsp;harness the synergies emerging from this shared&nbsp;needs and has strong ties both “horizontally” to affiliated Rl-projects </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">(EHRI, CENDARI, PARTHENOS</span><span class="font4">) and&nbsp;to sibling infrastructures like </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">CLARIN,</span><span class="font4"> as well as&nbsp;“vertically” to networks that specialize on the actual&nbsp;provision of these basic services like </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">eduGain</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">EGI,</span><span class="font4"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">EUDA</span><span class="font4"> . This is in line with DARIAH’s self-image as a&nbsp;facilitator that speaks the language of the researchers, but also has the “global critical mass” and expertise to approach and negotiate with large technical&nbsp;infrastructures.</span></p>
