<p><span class="font3">How did texts and ideas circulate within and between societies in the Middle Ages? We know that&nbsp;there were many potential vectors of movement:&nbsp;pilgrimage, crusade, merchant caravans and ships, and&nbsp;itinerant performers, to name a few. However,&nbsp;particularly in societies where transmission was&nbsp;largely oral, scholars usually cannot identify specific&nbsp;moments and locations when stories moved from one&nbsp;location to the next. For the medieval period, this lack&nbsp;of data has historically been the cause of heated&nbsp;debates as scholars identify stories that share common&nbsp;elements, but due to historical or political reasons they&nbsp;are resistant to any notion that one nation's literary&nbsp;tradition is &quot;indebted&quot; to another. Nonetheless,&nbsp;societies are influenced by art and ideas from around&nbsp;the world, and denying the contributions of global&nbsp;societies to stories that are held dear leads to&nbsp;isolationism and a sense of cultural superiority. In&nbsp;2016, US Congressman Steve King (R-Iowa)&nbsp;questioned what non-whites have contributed to&nbsp;civilization. I am presenting an early version of a&nbsp;project that aims to address a part of that question,&nbsp;giving an immersive digital experience of what some of&nbsp;those contributions might look like and just when and&nbsp;how they occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My project uses the Unity game engine to create stories of textual transmission. In particular, I am&nbsp;modeling how elements of the Thousand and One&nbsp;Nights could have circulated between East and West&nbsp;via the Lusignan court at the crusader kingdom of&nbsp;Cyprus circa 1194. In collaboration with Professor&nbsp;Sahar Amer (Arabic Studies, University of Sydney), we&nbsp;have identified a story from the Arabic text, The Prince&nbsp;Qamar Al Zaman and Princess Boudour, that shares&nbsp;narrative patterns and tropes with Old French&nbsp;romances </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Floire et Blanchefleur, L'Escoufle, Huon de&nbsp;Bordeaux,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Miracles de la fille d'un roi.</span><span class="font3"> Of course,&nbsp;each story has unique elements, but some of the&nbsp;striking scenes (dramatic public unveiling of mistaken&nbsp;gender identity) and themes (a princess who cross&nbsp;dresses and becomes an itinerant knight search of her&nbsp;lover only to be such a valiant warrior that she winds&nbsp;up married to her lord's daughter) are repeated. What&nbsp;is the relationship between Princess Boudour and&nbsp;Blanchefleur? Circumventing the theories of Joseph&nbsp;Campbell and Vladimir Propp that stories have basic,&nbsp;shared, &quot;universal&quot; components, we look at cultural&nbsp;context and emphasize variants. Our digital story will&nbsp;research and test various proposed vectors of&nbsp;transmission that ultimately result in the morphing of&nbsp;one story into a different incarnation of the same tale.&nbsp;While we will never have all versions of a story with&nbsp;changes and variations as it moved from one culture to&nbsp;the next, we can find the smoking gun as it were—&nbsp;places, times, and persons that we know participated&nbsp;in the exchange of objects, texts, and people. By making&nbsp;these moments visible we can test theories and vectors&nbsp;of transmission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For example, in the medieval period stories were often changed slightly to please the patrons who paid&nbsp;for them. Traveling minstrels would insert the names&nbsp;of local lords or knights into the story, likely to increase&nbsp;eventual payment at the end of the evening. Stories&nbsp;might also change to use more familiar geographical&nbsp;locations. More dramatic changes could find their way&nbsp;into via mistakes in translation or understanding of&nbsp;stories that passed from one court to the next. Some&nbsp;scribes and minstrels enjoyed changing tales&nbsp;drastically in order to leave their own mark. Within&nbsp;our 3D environment, users will experience the&nbsp;multicultural and multilingual Lusignan court and its&nbsp;environs. Users must make small decisions that will&nbsp;ultimately result in changes, sometimes dramatic, in&nbsp;the final tale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By illustrating just a few of the factors that influence storytelling and cultural interaction, we&nbsp;conceptualize two audiences. The first is someone who&nbsp;may not have ever considered how much cultural&nbsp;interchange can happen in simple storytelling. As the&nbsp;user makes choices, he or she sees and experiences&nbsp;directly the storytelling environment, becoming&nbsp;agents in the creation process. Our second audience is&nbsp;the researcher who, while being abstractly aware of all&nbsp;of these factors, may not see the potential impact of&nbsp;textual manipulation on a story important to his or her&nbsp;research. By working through these connections in an&nbsp;immersive environment, researchers will consider the&nbsp;global nature of the movement of ideas and&nbsp;interchanges in other texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The project brings together two areas of academic interest: global medieval studies and spatial studies.&nbsp;Both areas have well-developed audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">This project is part of the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Global Middle Ages&nbsp;Project</span><span class="font3"> that aims to make apparent the global cultural&nbsp;interactions that took place in the medieval period, a&nbsp;time that is frequently studied in nationalistic isolation&nbsp;with an apparent assumption that before the modern&nbsp;period people did not travel and were not aware of the&nbsp;wider world around them. With its strategic location&nbsp;in the Mediterranean, Cyprus served as a crossroads&nbsp;between east and west in the Middle Ages. Despite&nbsp;their disparate backgrounds, the Cypriots lived&nbsp;together on this relatively small island for centuries.&nbsp;Scholars (Andrews, Carr, Grunbart, Nicolaou-Konnari,&nbsp;Rogge, Schabel, and others) have looked at this multicultural space, establishing moments of contact and&nbsp;exchange using artifacts of architecture and art history.&nbsp;We will extend their work using data gathered from&nbsp;literary works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">As we create a space where users can&nbsp;experience the past, we must consider that the&nbsp;meaning and experience of that space was likely very&nbsp;different 1000 years ago. Robert Tally, following and&nbsp;modifying the work of Bertrand Westphal, Leonard&nbsp;Goldstein, and others, suggests that perceptions of&nbsp;time and space changed radically about the time that&nbsp;linear perspective arose in artistic works. In a&nbsp;medieval illumination, for instance, one might have&nbsp;snapshots of past, present, and future within one&nbsp;framed block. Foreground and background rest in the&nbsp;same plane. Starting with perspectival drawing,&nbsp;Goldstein suggests that space became experienced as&nbsp;1) continuous, isotropic, and homogenous; 2)&nbsp;quantifiable; and (3) perceived from the point of view&nbsp;of a single, central observer. As a contrast, a medieval&nbsp;map such as the 1375 Catalan Atlas evinces a different&nbsp;notion of time and space, at least in terms of visual&nbsp;representation. The map simultaneously includes the&nbsp;Queen of Sheba, the three wise men, and the Great&nbsp;Khan from vastly disparate eras (Old Testament, New&nbsp;Testament, and thirteenth century). Distances and&nbsp;landmasses are not measured to a modern sense of&nbsp;scale, though meaning can be induced from the relative&nbsp;sizes given to different areas and cities. Furthermore,&nbsp;we cannot know from which end the viewer was meant&nbsp;to see the map, as the writing and images are oriented&nbsp;in all directions. Space could comprise multiple times&nbsp;and places, and the lack of orientation toward a&nbsp;particular viewer indicates that perhaps multiple&nbsp;perspectives were expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this sense of space, medieval maps share many traits of video game maps, including the relationship&nbsp;between place and object, where time, distance, and&nbsp;proportion vacillate between being important and&nbsp;irrelevant. For Mario in Super Mario Bros., the distance&nbsp;on the map is not proportionate to the difficulty of the&nbsp;task of reaching the next point. On the Catalan Atlas,&nbsp;Sheba and the Three Wise Men are a part of the map&nbsp;because they share space and time since Creation,&nbsp;showing that time unites us (we are all postlapsarian&nbsp;and part of the map of Christian history) and separates&nbsp;us (we can never meet up since we do not exist at the&nbsp;same moment). A video game engine provides a&nbsp;superlative space for modeling these pre-modern&nbsp;notions of time and space that tell us much about how&nbsp;people, ideas, and texts circulated in the medieval&nbsp;Mediterranean.</span></p>
