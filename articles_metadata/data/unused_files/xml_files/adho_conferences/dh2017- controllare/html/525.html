<p><span class="font6">This study concerns Aby Warburg's last and most ambitious project: the Atlas Mnemosyne (or Bilderatlas), conceived in August 1926 and truncated three&nbsp;years later, unfinished, by Warburg's sudden death in&nbsp;October 1929. Mnemosyne consists of a series of large&nbsp;black panels, on which are attached a variable number&nbsp;of black-and-white photographs of paintings, sculptures, tarot cards, stamps, coins, and other types of images. The version we use is the one Warburg was&nbsp;working on at the time of his death, also known as the&nbsp;“1-79 version”: it includes around a thousand images</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pinned on 63 panels (This version of the Atlas is published in various print editions, and available </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">online)</span><span class="font6">. The Bilderatlas is a conceptual maze - the culmination&nbsp;of a life's scholarship in images and memory - through&nbsp;which perhaps the clearest thread is the concept of Pathosformel, or formula for (the expression of) passion.&nbsp;Much excellent work has been written on the concept&nbsp;but, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has yet tried&nbsp;to “operationalise” it - to turn it into a sequence of&nbsp;quantitative operations, or in other words, into an algorithm (Moretti, 2013).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pathosformel and its Operationalisation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">On the most basic level, the Pathosformel describes the portrayal passionate emotions through a formula,&nbsp;a repeatable visual paradigm. The Pathosformel owes&nbsp;much of its force, as Salvatore Settis has pointed out,&nbsp;to its combination of semantic opposites: an “oxymo-ronic word, in that it merges in the same term the&nbsp;movement of pathos and the rigidity of the formulaschema” (Settis 1997).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rather than attempting to operationalise the entire concept at once, we first break it down into its constituent components: first the morphology of formula,&nbsp;then the dynamism of pathos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We turn to two well-studied cases of Warburgian formula: the Death of Orpheus (where Warburg first&nbsp;named the concept of Pathosformel), and the Nymph,&nbsp;headhuntress and Fortuna (Bilderatlas panels 46-48).&nbsp;Looking at Warburg's examples of the Orpheus-formula, reproduced in Figure 1, we can hardly stop ourselves from spotting a formula which repeats across&nbsp;the ages; but how could this intuitive similarity be&nbsp;measured?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our algorithm comes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1. We isolate each individual body from its&nbsp;context</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font6">It is clear the Pathosformel relates to individual characters - the object&nbsp;of study thus becomes not panels or photographs in the Bilderatlas, but individual&nbsp;bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2. We take only the skeletons of such bodies.&nbsp;Here we are eliminating colour, clothes,&nbsp;hands, faces, gender, age. This is not to&nbsp;say that such factors aren't important:&nbsp;but they are not elementary to the formula (see for example, André Jolles' letter&nbsp;to Warburg 23rd December 1900, where&nbsp;the formula of Ghirlandaio's Nymph hops</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">between Judith, Salome, Tobias, Gabriel</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">etc.- see Ghelardi, 2004; or the formula in Bilderatlas Panel 47 shared between&nbsp;Giambolo-gna's Samson and Donatello's&nbsp;Judith.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3. We compare these skeletons by measuring the angles of the main limbs of the&nbsp;body, as described in Section 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each of these steps is not merely a convenient quantification, but a conceptual wager. This is the&nbsp;strength of operationalisation as a critical tool: it&nbsp;forces one to be explicit about the conceptual choices&nbsp;one makes.</span></p><img src="525_files/525-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:53pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0">Reproduced from Warburg 1905/1999</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Anatomy, Emotion and Pose</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Warburg was certainly influenced by Darwin's </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</span><span class="font6"> (Darwin 1872) - which, when talking about human emotions, largely concentrates on the face. Indeed, the first&nbsp;figure of the book is an anatomical diagram of the face&nbsp;- “I shall often have to refer [...] to the muscles of the&nbsp;human face” (Darwin 1872 p.23). Warburg was certainly struck by the book - writing in his diary “ein&nbsp;Buch, das mir hilft!” (Gombrich, p.72). He was also interested and capable of studying the face in art (see e.g.&nbsp;his discussion of faces in Ghirlandaio's Confirmation in&nbsp;Santa Trinita, in The Art of Portraiture in the Florentine Bourgeoisie (in Warburg 1999 p.185), yet never&nbsp;in relation to Pathos - his descriptions of the Pathosformel relate exclusively to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">body</span><span class="font6">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can relate Warburg's decision to the large psychological literature on emotional recognition from bodies. Psychological studies are based on the Light&nbsp;Spots Model by Johansson (1973), often called ‘biological motion', in which reducing body pose to 10-12&nbsp;points - quite comparable to our own reduction - is&nbsp;judged to give a ‘compelling impression of human&nbsp;walking, running, dancing etc.'. Using only Light Spots,&nbsp;observers can reliably tell gender and emotion from&nbsp;dynamic pose (Kozlowski 1977, Montepare 1987). Indeed, it has been suggested that our emotional understanding of faces is more influenced by our perception&nbsp;of the body than vice versa (Van den Stock 2007).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Encoding Pathos through Pose</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Atlas is, even by today's dataset standards, quite sizeable: 1000 images across 63 panels, containing an order of 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> depicted human figures. Scalable manual annotation is only therefore possible&nbsp;through crowdsourcing, which we did through the&nbsp;CrowdFlower platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Accurately annotating every visible figure in an image is a difficult and ambiguous tasks. Additionally, if different workers annotate different figures in the&nbsp;same image, the annotations cannot be collated or averaged. We therefore developed a two-stage annotation process:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Human figures are extracted from the painting by drawing bounding-boxes. This is done three times per&nbsp;image (by three separate workers).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having aggregated the information from the first stage, separate images are produced for each human&nbsp;figure. Detailed pose information (the position of major body-points) is then added by three separate workers, with the information aggregated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should be clarified that the decision to annotate bodies in isolation (for annotation accuracy and just&nbsp;worker compensation) is quite separate to the earlier&nbsp;conceptual decision to analyse bodies individually,&nbsp;which relates to the object of study. It would be quite&nbsp;possible to do either one without the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Using this two-stage annotation process, we have</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">presently annotated % of the Bilderatlas (by panels), resulting in 1,665 aggregated human poses. The collection and aggregation of the data are described in&nbsp;greater technical detail elsewhere (Impett, 2016).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Data Analysis: dimensionality reduction and dimensioned reductionism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Having encoded our static poses, how do we analyse and compare a collection of human figures of different sizes, proportions and orientations? We mirrored the poses horizontally and controlled for global rotation, ending up with a 11-dimensional vector </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6">,&nbsp;describing the angles of the main limbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From this angular pose vector, we can use circular statistics to find a morphological distance </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a,b</span><span class="font6"> between&nbsp;two poses </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font6">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">io</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>D</sup>a,b<sup>=</sup> £ \P<sub>a&lt;</sub>i</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;il</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">i=l</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a, i</span><span class="font6"> is the i<sup>th</sup> angle of pose vector </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> , and | |</span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font6">is the angular radian distance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">|x| <sub>a</sub> = </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">min(x,</span><span class="font6"> n - x)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These morphological pose-differences are perceptually meaningful over short distances. On a larger scale, they become less perceptually significant: is a&nbsp;sitting person ‘closer' to a lying or standing person?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to make our distance analysis perceptually relevant, therefore, we first clustered our 1,665 poses&nbsp;into 16 clusters by rotational K-means clustering&nbsp;(Dordet-Berdanet and Wicker 2008). Our two-stage&nbsp;clustering system is therefore as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I. K-means clustering (to produce meaningful clusters)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">II. Hierarchical clustering (for within-clus-ter morphological information)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of clusters K is chosen by looking at the inter-cluster variance over K. The result of the first&nbsp;stage of clustering is shown in Figure 2; Figure 3&nbsp;shows an example section from a hierarchical map of&nbsp;Cluster 1.</span></p><img src="525_files/525-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:182pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0">Fig 3: a detail from a dendrogram of different poses within the Bilderatlas, produced by second-stage clustering within</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cluster 2</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Unity of the Pathosformeln: from distant to close reading</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the clusters clearly represent physical activities - sitting, praying, embracing, dancing - whilst others seem more subtly communicative or expressive&nbsp;in nature. Having reorganised the 1,665 figures into 16&nbsp;mean-centred clusters, we proceeded to trace the classical Pathosformeln - identified in the Atlas by primary&nbsp;and secondary literature - through our clusters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The canonical Pathosformeln are mainly mythological figures (Perseus, Pentheus, Orpheus) or recurring allegories (Graces, Nymphs, Fortuna). They were previously described as distinct, and we expected to find&nbsp;a taxonomy of such formulae through our clustering&nbsp;analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the contrary, the statistical result was much stronger: a complete morphological unity. Almost&nbsp;every identified Pathosformel falls into Cluster 1, with&nbsp;few false positives - over 80% of the figures in Cluster&nbsp;1 are an identified Pathosformel. The handful of exceptions are all borderline cases, placed in peripheral to&nbsp;Cluster 1 (Clusters 7 and 13).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Looking more closely at the images themselves, as in Figure 4, this becomes visually clear: not only do the&nbsp;Pathosformeln share certain pose features (most importantly, a raised arm) present nowhere else in the&nbsp;dataset. To date, however, the authors know of no art-historical literature that has identified such morphological unity.</span></p><img src="525_files/525-4.jpg" style="width:205pt;height:275pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 4, clockwise from top-left: Laocoon, Orpheus, Fortuna, Nymph, Judith, Perseus - all except Orpheus are in&nbsp;the Atlas. The identified Pathosformeln share distinguishing&nbsp;features from the other characters in the Atlas: a raised arm,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">most often accompanied by a lowered second arm, and a slight twist of the body.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Concluding remarks</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Our morphological model for Pathosformel is statistically strong: but what are the art-historical implications? The oppositional symmetry and raised arm of Cluster 1 (Fig. 2) reminds us of a Contrapposto, but the&nbsp;bodies themselves are far removed from such classical&nbsp;balance (e.g. Fig. 4, top). Rather than movement, tension (between upper and lower body) seems to be the&nbsp;fundamental element of Pathosformel - the nature of&nbsp;which will be the subject of a subsequent publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our morphological analysis has shown that static pose can identify Pathosformeln, and that a study of&nbsp;static pose through a large collection of artistic works&nbsp;can identify links across styles, periods and cultures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Automatic detection of pose is a focus of the current research, and will allow us to expand our art-historical&nbsp;models beyond the Bilderatlas. Humans (thus bodies,&nbsp;and poses) are unsurprisingly the most common feature of human art, and therefore make excellent objects of study for an art history of the Longue Durée&nbsp;(Robb 2015).</span></p><div>
