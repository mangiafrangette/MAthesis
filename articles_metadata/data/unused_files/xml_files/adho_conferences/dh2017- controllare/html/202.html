<p><span class="font3">In the field of global history, especially when it comes to « histoire croisée », the use of metaphors&nbsp;describing the vertical organization of a society, its&nbsp;structuration into layers or into overlapping systems,&nbsp;is common. The temptation to use a second metaphor,&nbsp;calling everything a “network”, is also very important&nbsp;in this domain, whose objects of study are often&nbsp;transnational organizations with multiple branches,&nbsp;intertwined within umbrella organizations, sharing&nbsp;board members and including several levels of&nbsp;secretariats and subcommittees (Grandjean 2017).&nbsp;However, the use of these images is not limited to&nbsp;historical studies, since we use the same vocabulary in&nbsp;other disciplines to describe social situations or&nbsp;textual structures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we go beyond the metaphor to develop a formal analysis, we often produce multigraphs who,&nbsp;because they simultaneously express horizontal and&nbsp;vertical relationships, are generally unsuitable for the&nbsp;analysis (and visualisation, except in very simple&nbsp;cases). If the “exploratory” dimension of social&nbsp;network analysis - and especially the fact that its&nbsp;display is relatively subjective - is often a subject of&nbsp;criticism, we propose here to play with the visual&nbsp;representation to show precisely how an original&nbsp;modelling can improve the reading of complex graphs,&nbsp;and helping to restore a “morphological” (Moretti&nbsp;1999, 68) information where disorder seems to&nbsp;prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based on two examples from archives mapping and theatre character networks, this paper proposes a&nbsp;reflection on the different ways to take account of&nbsp;verticality in graphs. In particular, we are developing&nbsp;a way to impose a macro-structure to a network,&nbsp;allowing a two-dimensions view that reflects the&nbsp;hierarchical affiliations of its components. We will see&nbsp;that this method, by constructing a stable visual&nbsp;representation in time and space, helps to compare&nbsp;different types of relationships and/or different time&nbsp;states of the graph.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Network levels</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">What is evident in an affiliation network is not always explicit in other situations, but a multimode&nbsp;graph is always the expression of a form of multilevel&nbsp;network (Lazega and Snijders 2016). For instance,&nbsp;there is an implicit hierarchy among the committees&nbsp;level and the level of individuals within them. It is thus&nbsp;easy to imagine such networks as superimposed&nbsp;layers, linked by the vertical affiliation links. And this&nbsp;analysis is obviously interesting because these vertical&nbsp;links are not the only ones to influence the model&nbsp;structure: committees in the upper stratum may&nbsp;themselves be organized into their own horizontal&nbsp;structure, as well as individuals, in the lower stratum,&nbsp;can weave relationship regardless of the structure of&nbsp;the committees to which they belong. This kind of&nbsp;macro/micro-structure comparison is not new in&nbsp;sociology: through sociometric approaches of urban&nbsp;social structures, for example, some address the&nbsp;organization of metropolitan communities together&nbsp;with that of interpersonal relationships (Laumann&nbsp;1973). This raises the issue of representing these&nbsp;networks within a two-dimensional plane, e.g. by&nbsp;changes in the colour and shape of the markers (Wang&nbsp;et al. 2016), or by an artificial transfer of the upper-level in a region of the graph that enables them to be&nbsp;read (Zappa and Lomi 2015). When the low&nbsp;complexity of networks allows, some may also use&nbsp;three-dimensional representations, clearly indicating&nbsp;the superimposed planes (Brailly and Lazega 2012).</span></p><img src="202_files/202-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:206pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1. Multilevel system of networks where individuals having personal relationships (C) and exchanging&nbsp;documents (D) are affiliated to institutions (B) themselves&nbsp;hierarchically organized (A). E, F and G visualize in 2D the&nbsp;vertical relationships expressed in 3D left.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The model: projecting structure on relations</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Fig. 1 visually explains a relatively simple multilevel graph, with four levels of actors (documents&nbsp;D, exchanged by individuals C belonging to subinstitutions B themselves grouped by top-institutions&nbsp;A) and five different types of relationships, including&nbsp;three vertical. This example depicts an institution, but&nbsp;it can be exported in a wide variety of domains : it may&nbsp;well be a medieval family network (C) in villages (B)&nbsp;under the authority of lordships (A), and sharing&nbsp;agricultural properties (D). Or theatre characters&nbsp;having friendship relations (C), organized in groups&nbsp;(B) and appearing together in scenes (D). In these&nbsp;examples, we see very concretely how the 2-mode&nbsp;graph express vertical relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Secondly, we proceed to a flattening of the hierarchical structure of the two upper levels as sets&nbsp;containing the elements to be studied (here,&nbsp;individuals), as in Fig. 2 (I). Now it is no longer the&nbsp;horizontal relationships between individuals (C) that&nbsp;affect the display of the graph but these sets, fixed once&nbsp;and for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Creating a stable spatialization is the condition for a comparative analysis: we can therefore display side&nbsp;by side the graph of document exchanges (J, product&nbsp;by projecting G as a 1-mode graph of individuals) and&nbsp;the graph of interpersonal relations (I), without a&nbsp;reorganization of nodes that would make the&nbsp;hierarchy unreadable.</span></p><img src="202_files/202-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:113pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 2. To reduce the complexity of a multigraph and allow a comparative analysis of different types of&nbsp;relationships, we gather the micro-level relations (I and J) in&nbsp;the macro-level structure. Here, we therefore compare interinstitutional relations (H), the personal relations of the&nbsp;individuals (K) and the documents exchanged between them&nbsp;(L), all summarized in sub-institutional level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then we move to the upper level by summarizing the individual relationships as relations between the&nbsp;groups they belong to. We can now compare the&nbsp;institutional relation between these groups (H) with&nbsp;personal relationships (K) and the exchange of&nbsp;documents (L). In our example, we see that the&nbsp;patterns are very different, even though a majority of&nbsp;relationships logically occur within the subinstitutions (see self-edges in K and L).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Applications</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">When Sampson, in the central square of Verona, calls his colleague Gregory, also a servant in the&nbsp;Capulet family, he creates the first edge of the&nbsp;character network of Shakespeare's tragedy « Romeo&nbsp;and Juliet » (for more discussion of the study of&nbsp;character networks, see Trilke et al. 2015 and Xanthos&nbsp;et al. 2016). The readability of the interaction graph of&nbsp;this introductory scene, the confrontation of the two&nbsp;hostile houses, is greatly enhanced by a highlight of&nbsp;these vertical relationships (Fig. 3), the affiliations of&nbsp;all the protagonists to family identities that will&nbsp;structure the plot.</span></p><img src="202_files/202-3.jpg" style="width:238pt;height:98pt;"/>

<p><span class="font1">algorithm, and on the right by imposing a “family geography”) (family in the inner circle, servants in the outer&nbsp;circle).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the context of more complex networks, where it is less about creating a new visual and pedagogical&nbsp;artifact to facilitate narratological studies than to find&nbsp;a way to automate pattern detection, we will also&nbsp;discuss the case of network analysis of large archive&nbsp;corpora (Grandjean 2014). In this case (Fig. 4), we will&nbsp;show in particular that it is possible to detect&nbsp;individuals that bypass institutional hierarchy, when&nbsp;horizontal relationships do not align with vertical&nbsp;affiliations.</span></p><img src="202_files/202-4.jpg" style="width:221pt;height:103pt;"/>
