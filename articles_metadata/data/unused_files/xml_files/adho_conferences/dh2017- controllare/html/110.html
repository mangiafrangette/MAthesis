<p><span class="font4">This paper will discuss how our newly prototyped</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">POEMAGE</span><span class="font4"> visualization tool (see McCurdy et al, 2015), created to identify and visualize complex sonic&nbsp;relationships within individual poems, has provided&nbsp;poetry scholars with new ways to identify and conceptualize metaphor, which has previously been considered computationally intractable because of its&nbsp;semantic and syntactic complexities. It focuses not on&nbsp;the tool's technical details but on the ongoing retheorization of poetry it has engendered,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Close readers are trained to connect every element in a poem to every other in an ambiguous, shifting&nbsp;complex of meaning, which the reader, bringing her&nbsp;own complexities to the process, activates. This poetic dynamic makes computational analysis and visualization of any aspect of poetry a challenge. The goal of&nbsp;our research team has been to take a single poetic&nbsp;element—sound—and treat it computationally and&nbsp;visually at a level of complexity that will make POE-MAGE useful to poets and scholars performing sophisticated close readings of poetry, even as it makes&nbsp;poetry more accessible to students and casual readers. Though sound interacts with the other features&nbsp;operating within a poem, unlike most other features it&nbsp;can be looked at in its own terms and is subject to&nbsp;computer analysis through quantification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we began, poet Julie Gonnering Lein and I sought to preserve poetry's qualitative, aesthetic experience; computer scientists Miriah Meyer and Nina&nbsp;McCurdy sought to address open questions in their&nbsp;field. Both goals required moving beyond what the&nbsp;machine could already do. Off-the-shelf software can&nbsp;see exact rhyme quickly, as can a good reader—who&nbsp;will swiftly move on to look for sonic relationships&nbsp;that don't replicate themselves but enact disruptive&nbsp;changes that are hard to identify computationally. To&nbsp;capture the progression of sonic clusters as they repeat in different and evolving combinations not only&nbsp;within but across syllables presents a computational&nbsp;problem that required our technical team to develop&nbsp;RhymeDesign, which allows users to query a broad&nbsp;range of sonic patterns within a poem and to design&nbsp;custom templates to query patterns we haven't imagined. Built on top of RhymeDesign, the POEMAGE interface visualizes and allows users to explore interactions of the queried patterns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In performing this work, we have looked for (and not yet found) computational breakthroughs that&nbsp;might bring metaphor within reach, a process that&nbsp;has required us to consider closely how metaphor&nbsp;works. The difficulty with metaphor inheres even in&nbsp;simple instances. Getting the machine to understand&nbsp;why “Hope is a bird” (or, more problematically,&nbsp;“‘Hope' is the thing with feathers”) is a metaphor but&nbsp;“Juliet is a Capulet” and “Karen is a Carpenter” may be&nbsp;either similar or different statements of fact is not&nbsp;straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Poets as different as Dickinson and Donne play complex metaphors out across entire poems in elaborate and shifting figural structures. To develop a tool&nbsp;that can reliably identify metaphoric relationships as&nbsp;POEMAGE identifies sonic relationships—in real time&nbsp;across the entire poetic field—would require the solution of multiple open problems in computer science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, recent readings of poems by Dickinson and others, undertaken using POEMAGE, suggest that&nbsp;it is possible to use the tool to access some metaphors&nbsp;not directly but indirectly, leveraging the fact that&nbsp;both rhyme and metaphor operate by substituting&nbsp;one word for another that is different-but-similar, and&nbsp;that inevitably sites of sonic difference-in-similarity&nbsp;point to semantic difference-in-similarity as well. In&nbsp;close reading, we have noted that places the machine&nbsp;marks as being sonically “interesting” are also sites of&nbsp;metaphorical action, and that this action often inheres in, rather than simply existing alongside, the&nbsp;sonic relationships being indicated by the tool. This&nbsp;inherence can emerge through various kinds of sonic&nbsp;relationships, including but not limited to homonyms&nbsp;like “knot” and “naught,” which POEMAGE shows in&nbsp;Bradstreet's “Prologue,” and eye-rhymes like “blood”&nbsp;and “mood,” which it picks up across Pelizzon's&nbsp;“Blood Memory,” about menstruation. In presenting&nbsp;these words as related, even conjoined, the machine&nbsp;opens a space for us to tease out figural connections&nbsp;between a loop in a rope and nothingness, or menstrual blood and emotional pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A more complex example of metaphor developing through sound occurs in Dickinson's #313:</span></p><img src="110_files/110-1.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:156pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: The user selects from the sonic rhymes available in the left-hand panel. The middle panel shows by color&nbsp;which words are implicated in a particular rhyme and which&nbsp;share phenomes. The right-hand panel shows how various&nbsp;rhymes flow through the poem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visualization, which shows words that connect with “soul” through specific sonic relationships, makes clear at a glance that “soul” is sonically implicated with virtually every other word in the poem,&nbsp;though of course it is more strongly associated with&nbsp;some words than others. Its identification with “you”&nbsp;and “your” is notable, but I am more attentive to its&nbsp;strong links to “so” (a perfect rhyme and identical&nbsp;except for one dropped phoneme), “slow” (which deploys exactly the same three phonemes, with the second two reversed), and “still,” which begins and ends&nbsp;with the same phoneme. Here, then, the “soul,” identified with “you,” is also sonically and so (because&nbsp;words mean) semantically identified with, in this order, intensity, slowness, and stillness. Beyond this,&nbsp;the tool invites an unlikely leap: the connection of&nbsp;“soul” with the poem's last word, “paws”—a big&nbsp;enough stretch that I am not sure I would make it&nbsp;without the tool's suggestion. This sonnet, which&nbsp;ends with what should be a rhymed couplet, teases by&nbsp;failing to do so. However, the tool's connection of&nbsp;“paws” with “slow” and, through “slow,” to “soul” and&nbsp;finally “still,” may suggest to the attentive reader an&nbsp;absent but implied homonym, “pause.” Here, through&nbsp;an indirection of sound, the poem creates a semantic&nbsp;“rhyme” between “paws/pause” and “still.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another case arises from our group's interest in uncertainty analysis, rooted in our understanding of&nbsp;ambiguity as a fundamental function of language,&nbsp;which led us to include in POEMAGE a “show uncertainty” button. Even beyond vagaries of accent, numerous words—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tear</span><span class="font4"> comes to mind immediately—&nbsp;can be pronounced in more than one way, and mean&nbsp;differently depending on pronunciation. Every such&nbsp;word requires the machine to make a “guess”—a statistical prediction—about how the word is pronounced within the poem. The “show uncertainty”&nbsp;button allows the user to see words with alternate&nbsp;pronunciations as well as how the machine has chosen to pronounce them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In “Night” by Louise Bogan, the tool mishears</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[short i] “wind” as [long i] “wind” (note that it rhymes with “tide”:</span></p><img src="110_files/110-2.jpg" style="width:233pt;height:175pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Given its instructions, and the overwhelming probability that any one-syllable word comprising a beginning consonant and “ind” will have a long and not a short vowel, the computer had little choice but to&nbsp;make the “judgment” it did, even though the proficient </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">human</span><span class="font4"> native speaker would not make this delightful mistake. In this “mishearing” of the poem, an&nbsp;inlet winding becomes “restless,” and in this restlessness the central metaphor of the poem takes shape.&nbsp;Through such reading, we can see that tools designed&nbsp;to help forestall error in science may reveal disturbances that add to the richness of a poem by opening&nbsp;interpretive space and not only the possibility for but&nbsp;the actual presence of metaphor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, “getting at metaphor” in this oblique way, even if we give it a separate button in the tool, is&nbsp;not the same as creating a tool that will algorithmically identify and visualize metaphor through its syntactic or semantic construction. However, in some cases&nbsp;this method may still be useful, especially for users&nbsp;who believe, as we do, that the purpose of any visualization is not to replace human reading but to send us&nbsp;back to the poem. An unexpected by-product of our&nbsp;tool, it is already provoking rich readings, which show&nbsp;that shaping our queries about sound so that the machine can answer with metaphor helps us understand&nbsp;dynamics inherent to poetry, which invites readers to&nbsp;connect every feature to every other feature. Thus,&nbsp;POEMAGE furthers the larger goal of reliably identifying metaphor through computational methods. It&nbsp;also suggests ways forward in our overarching goal of&nbsp;identifying such complex features for visualisation in&nbsp;their own right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are just a few instances among many in which POEMAGE queries, by locating sonic difference&nbsp;in similarity, have identified places in poems that are&nbsp;not only sonically but metaphorically rich. Though&nbsp;we often believe the complexity of language may create an obstacle to the computational analysis of poetry, this argument represents a re-theorization of ways&nbsp;in which a tool originally meant to aid in one kind of&nbsp;analysis can give access to information and insight&nbsp;not originally predicted or even sought, not in spite of&nbsp;but because of poetry's linguistic complexity.</span></p>
