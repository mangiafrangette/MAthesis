<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Tongues, Multiple Networks: A corpus-based&nbsp;pragmatic study of&nbsp;multilingualism on Nigerian&nbsp;virtual political space</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This presentation concludes by suggesting that online multilingual discursive practices may be indicative of or closely linked to people's purpose-driven&nbsp;offline sociolinguistic practices and identities deployed for socio-pragmatic goals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This study examines the increasing utilisation of the Internet and related digital media technologies&nbsp;such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for political&nbsp;activities and civic engagement in Nigeria. It focuses&nbsp;specifically on the ways in which political actors and&nbsp;citizens in Nigeria draw on the existing multilingual&nbsp;resources within the Nigerian sociolinguistic ecosystem in their web-based political interactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The study also discusses how these stakeholders use a combination of mixed codes in online interactions with political issues and political stakeholders to&nbsp;reshape the political space and promote participatory&nbsp;democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theoretical insights that underpin the study adopt approaches from </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">computer-mediated discourse&nbsp;analysis </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">pragmatics. </span><span class="font1">The data set consists of a&nbsp;range of media multilingual-based online political&nbsp;posts between 2011 and 2015 elicited from our corpus&nbsp;construction project, CONNMDE (Corpus of Nigeria&nbsp;New Media Discourse in English). The methodological</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">procedures also utilise some digital humanities software packages and concordances such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sketch Engine</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">AntConc3.4</span><span class="font1"> for data harvesting and to complement the qualitative and quantitative analyses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(Baker, et al, 2008:275).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Generally speaking, the study reports some findings on the ongoing digital humanities project focusing on new media corpus construction. It then isolates and&nbsp;identifies clear instances of deliberate deployment of&nbsp;multilingual resources influenced by and rooted in&nbsp;ethnolinguistic identities as communication inclusion&nbsp;strategy. It equally confirms that Nigerian politicians&nbsp;use political websites with multilingual texts to encode acts of political persuasion and convey pragmatic&nbsp;meanings.</span></p>
