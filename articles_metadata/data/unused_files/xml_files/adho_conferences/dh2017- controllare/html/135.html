<p><span class="font4">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's 20142015 Scholarly Communications Initiative funded more than thirteen projects of various sizes and&nbsp;orientations as part of an effort to strengthen the&nbsp;scholarly monograph publishing ecosystem in a&nbsp;time of increasing disruption. While the projects&nbsp;are seemingly divergent in their approaches, a&nbsp;recent report from Simon Fraser University,&nbsp;“Reassembling Scholarly Communications: An&nbsp;Evaluation of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's&nbsp;Monograph Initiative” (May 2016) identifies&nbsp;points of thematic alignment and overlap. Many&nbsp;of the funded projects are explicitly based in&nbsp;university presses, with the goal of either&nbsp;enhancing existing monograph programs or&nbsp;developing digital capacity where little or none&nbsp;exists. But three projects, located at University of&nbsp;Illinois, Brown University, and University of&nbsp;Connecticut, are instead focused on exploring&nbsp;new forms for scholarly expression and&nbsp;developing models for faculty digital publication&nbsp;outside the traditional press framework.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Building Capacity for Digital Scholarship &amp; Publishing” panel brings together&nbsp;representatives from each of these three projects&nbsp;to investigate unique and complementary&nbsp;dimensions of their work. Presenters include</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maria Bonn from the University of Illinois, Elli Mylonas from Brown University, and Sara Sikes&nbsp;from the University of Connecticut. The session&nbsp;will address the development of project&nbsp;outcomes and encourage participation in a&nbsp;discussion about large-scale shifts in structural&nbsp;and cultural approaches to faculty-led digital&nbsp;scholarship production and publication. Rather&nbsp;than building new publishing platforms, these&nbsp;three Mellon-funded projects are focused on&nbsp;exploring workflows and work cultures suited to&nbsp;the creation of multimodal scholarly&nbsp;communications. The University of Illinois will&nbsp;explore how current tools align with scholars'&nbsp;publishing requirements and address the gap&nbsp;between scholars' needs and the existing&nbsp;publishing systems for digital scholarship. At&nbsp;both Brown University and University of&nbsp;Connecticut, the scholarly publications initiatives&nbsp;are focused on developing an infrastructure to&nbsp;support digital scholarship projects, facilitating&nbsp;new workflows and work cultures, and revising&nbsp;criteria for tenure and promotion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Publishing Without Walls” is a Mellon-funded initiative at the University of Illinois, led by the&nbsp;University Library in partnership with the School&nbsp;of Information Sciences, the department of&nbsp;African American Studies, and the Illinois&nbsp;Program for Research in the Humanities. The&nbsp;objective is to develop a model for library-based&nbsp;publishing services that can be adopted broadly&nbsp;by other academic libraries to address scholars'&nbsp;emerging needs in a contemporary publishing&nbsp;environment. Both an embedded research effort&nbsp;and programmatic development are strategically&nbsp;designed to address known gaps within the&nbsp;current landscape: the gap between what and&nbsp;how scholars want to publish and what existing&nbsp;systems of print publishing can afford; the gap&nbsp;between the everyday practices of humanities&nbsp;scholars and the high-level tools that exist for&nbsp;digital scholarship; and the gap between digital&nbsp;scholarship and publishing at resource-rich&nbsp;institutions as opposed to at Historically Black&nbsp;Colleges and Universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most experiments with new forms of and models for digital publishing focus on parts of the&nbsp;process rather than taking a holistic, scholarcentric view of publication: for example, tools are&nbsp;often developed with only an abstract sense of&nbsp;scholarly requirements, and new funding models&nbsp;are suggested without exploring whether and&nbsp;how existing systems meet scholars' needs. In&nbsp;order to guide the development of a more holistic&nbsp;and widely shareable service model, the&nbsp;University of Illinois is undertaking a significant&nbsp;qualitative study on how emerging services and&nbsp;tools align with scholars' publishing needs and&nbsp;using the findings to shape and inform the&nbsp;development of tools and services for Publishing&nbsp;Without Walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Role of the University in Scholarly Communication</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i Mylonas</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">The purpose of Brown University's Mellon-funded digital scholarship initiative is to establish an infrastructure to support the development and&nbsp;publication of digital scholarly monographs.&nbsp;Anchored in the University Library and the Office&nbsp;of the Dean of the Faculty, this digital publishing&nbsp;initiative extends the University's mission of&nbsp;supporting and promoting the scholarship of its&nbsp;faculty, while also playing a role in shaping the&nbsp;future of digital scholarship in the humanities&nbsp;more broadly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brown will first address questions about the evaluation of digital scholarship within the&nbsp;academic validation process. The initiative&nbsp;promotes the creation of language and criteria at&nbsp;the department level upon which digital&nbsp;scholarship will be evaluated for tenure and&nbsp;promotion purposes, and this process is, as of&nbsp;Spring 2017, substantially complete. With these&nbsp;guidelines established the initiative is now&nbsp;supporting two digital scholarly publications.&nbsp;Mellon grant funds have been used to augment&nbsp;the library's staff, adding new positions including&nbsp;the Digital Scholarship Editor, a Designer for&nbsp;Online Publications, and graduate- and&nbsp;undergraduate-level researchers. Funds from the&nbsp;grant are also designated to bring in speakers&nbsp;who are engaged in digital projects or other&nbsp;efforts to introduce digital scholarship and&nbsp;publication into the formal academic process in&nbsp;order to spark discussions around best practices&nbsp;and innovative approaches. By tackling first the&nbsp;issue of evaluation and then assisting with the&nbsp;creation of innovative, digital-first scholarship as&nbsp;well as innovative digital publication, the&nbsp;initiative will remove barriers in place at Brown&nbsp;and potentially serve as an example to other&nbsp;institutions that are engaging with emerging&nbsp;forms of writing, publication, and dissemination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scholarly Communications Design</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Studio</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sara Sikes</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">The Digital Media &amp; Design Department at the University of Connecticut (UConn), in&nbsp;collaboration with the University Library and&nbsp;UConn Humanities Institute, is implementing&nbsp;Greenhouse Studios | Scholarly Communications&nbsp;Design at UConn. Greenhouse Studios will&nbsp;facilitate a design-based,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inquiry-driven,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">collaboration-first workflow that addresses the divided processes and counter-productive labor&nbsp;arrangements that have complicated scholarly&nbsp;communications in the digital age. Even as the&nbsp;scholarly communications field pursues the&nbsp;opportunities presented by digital technology, its&nbsp;routine operations remain anchored in printcentric regimens. For those striving to evolve&nbsp;digital scholarship production and publication in&nbsp;the Internet age, particularly as it bears upon&nbsp;long-form scholarship, there is compelling need&nbsp;to productively disrupt and reconfigure the&nbsp;processes and work cultures that have&nbsp;naturalized around the production of printed&nbsp;products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proposed approach of Greenhouse Studios is undergirded by design-thinking&nbsp;methodologies that foster divergent creativity in&nbsp;generating and developing ideas directed toward&nbsp;solving complex problems while keeping end&nbsp;recipients of a project squarely in mind. Design&nbsp;thinking practices do not, in and of themselves,&nbsp;address cultural or workflow hierarchies,&nbsp;therefore a refined design process model has&nbsp;been established so that work begins with a&nbsp;prompt, an inquiry-in-common, that is set before&nbsp;a project team. In the design process model for&nbsp;the Mellon initiative undertaken at UConn, the&nbsp;potential audiences of a publication are explored&nbsp;at the very outset of a project, in specific rather&nbsp;than vague terms, as an essential element of the&nbsp;workflow. The team members hail from the areas&nbsp;once conceived of as the transactional links in the&nbsp;scholarly communications process, including&nbsp;librarians, web developers, editors, and&nbsp;designers, and they are assembled as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">collaborative unit at the very outset of each undertaking. The power of the values and ways of&nbsp;working to be instantiated through the&nbsp;Greenhouses Studios places continuous, equitable&nbsp;communication between all kinds of scholarly&nbsp;communications labor at the heart of its mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In its broadest sense, “scholarly communications” is conceived of as&nbsp;communication of scholarship to specific&nbsp;audiences in a manner designed to make the&nbsp;expression of knowledge informative, useful, and&nbsp;relevant to that particular community. By&nbsp;employing the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multimodal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">communications, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;researchers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">scholarship are connected to broad peer or public constituencies, and a work may be expressed in&nbsp;multiple form, each tailored to a different type of&nbsp;audience. As we look beyond inward-focused&nbsp;text, the visual, aural, and interactive forms of&nbsp;expression open pathways into understanding&nbsp;complex material that print alone cannot.</span></p>
