<p><span class="font3">Yasunari Kawabata was a Japanese novelist who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968. He was&nbsp;famous for his masterpieces such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Snow Country</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Sound of the Mountain</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the&nbsp;Sleeping Beauties,</span><span class="font3"> and so on. Kawabata had a shattered&nbsp;childhood. He was orphaned at five years old, and his&nbsp;other relatives including his grandfather, grandmother, and elder sister also passed away before he&nbsp;was fourteen. The successive deaths of his loved ones&nbsp;induced mental problems, which became worse in the&nbsp;1960s. He became addicted to sleeping pills during&nbsp;those years. However, two of Kawabata's masterpieces </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3"> were published during his sleeping pills addiction&nbsp;period. These two novels were suspected as having&nbsp;been written by ghostwriters because it was hard to&nbsp;imagine that Kawabata could continue writing novels&nbsp;in his mental condition. There are already some pieces&nbsp;of evidence for the ghostwriter issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3">. Kawabata sent a&nbsp;letter to Sawano before the publication of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3">. In the letter he wrote: “I have accepted to write a&nbsp;novel about Kyoto; the deadline is approaching but I&nbsp;even don't know how to start. Sawano was surprised&nbsp;when he received this letter. He went to Kyoto to meet&nbsp;Kawabata and gave advice on how to write </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old&nbsp;Capital</span><span class="font3">. Itasaka mentions in his book that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3"> were actually&nbsp;written by ghostwriters (Itasaka, 1997). </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> may have been written by Kawabata's three disciples whose names are Hisao Sawano, Makoto Hokujyo,&nbsp;and Yukio Mishima. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3"> may&nbsp;have been written by Yukio Mishima. In this study, we&nbsp;show strong evidence suggesting the real author of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3"> from&nbsp;a data analysis approach.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The method of this study includes three main steps. Firstly, we digitized more than ten novels of both Ka-wabata and the three possible ghostwriters. Then, we&nbsp;extracted stylometric features from the novels, and all&nbsp;chapters of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping&nbsp;Beauties</span><span class="font3">. Finally, we applied the unsupervised and supervised methods to infer the possible author of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We used bigrams of characters and punctuation marks, part-of-speech bigrams, and phrase patterns as&nbsp;stylometric features, which have been proven useful in&nbsp;Japanese authorship attribution (Matsuura and&nbsp;Kanada, 2000; Jin, 2003, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bigrams of characters and punctuation marks are pairs of two adjacent characters or punctuation marks&nbsp;extracted from plain text. Japanese texts should be to-kenized previously for the extraction of part-of-speech&nbsp;features. We applied the Japanese morphological analyzer called MeCab to separate a Japanese sentence&nbsp;into morphemes. MeCab outputs the parts-of-speech&nbsp;of words in several layers. Deeper layers process more&nbsp;detailed information. In this study, we use information&nbsp;from the first layer. As an example, part-of-speech bigrams in the Japanese sentence “Ronbun wo kaku.” are&nbsp;“Noun_Particle,” “Particle_Verb,” and “Verb_Period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Phrase pattern is a powerful feature that can be extracted in terms of syntax. A Japanese parser (Cabo-Cha) was introduced to separate sentences into phrases. Phrase pattern is defined as the smallest unit&nbsp;that divides the sentence into unnatural parts (Jin,&nbsp;2013). It is a combination of two parts. One is the original form of the particles and punctuation marks, while&nbsp;the other is the parts-of-speech of the other materials,&nbsp;except for the particles and punctuation marks in the&nbsp;same phrase. The two phrase patterns in the sentence&nbsp;“Ronbun wo kaku.” are “Noun_wo” and “Verb_Period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We applied unsupervised methods and the integrated classification algorithm in this study. The idea of the integrated classification algorithm was to combine the results of several stylometric features and&nbsp;classifiers. It achieved highest classification accuracy&nbsp;in authorship attribution of literature (Jin, 2014). The&nbsp;integrated classification algorithm combines the results of stylometric features and classifiers to avoid&nbsp;the bias under a majority vote rule. AdaBoost (ADA),&nbsp;High-dimensional Discriminant Analysis (HDDA), Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Random Forest (RF), and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used as the base classifiers.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The result of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3"> reveals that compared to Mishima, all chapters of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of the&nbsp;Sleeping Beauties</span><span class="font3"> are more likely to be written by Ka-wabata</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font3">The result in the classification between Kawa-bata and Hokujyo shows that the writing style in all&nbsp;chapters of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Capital</span><span class="font3"> is more like Kawabata's.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
