<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is memory that makes your identity. If your memory be lost, how will you be the same man?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">- Voltaire</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">India is well-known for its diversity of culture. Like its languages, its localities too have evolved through&nbsp;the ages, each abounding in markers that talk of its&nbsp;past - externalized, at times, in monuments or&nbsp;historical artefacts, but captured even more&nbsp;eloquently, perhaps, in the customs, rituals, traditions,&nbsp;songs, arts and crafts, language and the daily life of its&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet, as India modernizes, this very diversity that has been a hallmark of the civilization is under threat.&nbsp;The homogenizing effects of globalization are all too&nbsp;visible as one traverses the country today; as cities and&nbsp;towns, that look more and more alike, expand to&nbsp;swallow up rural suburbs, and people give up&nbsp;traditional vocations and lifestyles to join the global&nbsp;workforce (Varghese, 2013). While this is reported&nbsp;positively in economic circles, and is counted as a&nbsp;welcoming sign of the increasing prosperity of vast&nbsp;majorities of the Indian populace, an unfortunate side-effect, concurrently felt, is the loss of the sense of&nbsp;uniqueness, traditionally associated with each Indian&nbsp;locality. This has led to growing pangs, across&nbsp;significant cross-sections of the society, about a&nbsp;gnawing loss of cultural identity - a concern not&nbsp;restricted to India or Indians (Khair, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Limories (<a href="http://www.limories.in">www.limories.in</a>) is a work-in-progress system that attempts to capture the distinctiveness&nbsp;and uniqueness of a locality from its people. Limories&nbsp;believes that the sense of past of a locality, unique to&nbsp;each locality, inheres in each and every individual&nbsp;associated with it, and is special and key to&nbsp;understanding and appreciating that locality wholly&nbsp;and in full. Limories attempts to do this by sourcing the&nbsp;externalized memories from the people themselves;&nbsp;collating, curating and presenting them - using opensource technologies. Goals include coming up with a&nbsp;curation framework, tools, standards and best&nbsp;practices, practical and relevant to the Indian context,&nbsp;which can be applied across localities. The&nbsp;generalization is a particular challenge, given the&nbsp;emphasis on the ‘vaiseshik’ - the 'distinctive' of each&nbsp;locality, aimed to be captured. And indeed, how one&nbsp;applies the general to the particular, remains a key&nbsp;differentiator between sciences and humanities&nbsp;(Singh, 2003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This short paper will describe the pilot site where Limories was attempted, and the results thereof. It will&nbsp;also outline challenges being worked out, and the&nbsp;overall roadmap.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The pilot site</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">Kodungallur is a quiet town in Kerala, situated near the mouth of where one of the two arms of the&nbsp;perennial Periyar River empties itself into the Arabian&nbsp;Sea.</span></p><img src="221_files/221-1.jpg" style="width:202pt;height:244pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Source: Google Maps</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Known during the colonial period as Cranganore, Kodungallur was earlier famous as capital to the&nbsp;Perumals of Kerala during the formative 9th-12th&nbsp;centuries CE of Kerala history and culture (Narayanan,&nbsp;1972).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Until recently, Kodungallur was considered to be the ancient port of Muziris, described in Greco-Roman&nbsp;texts, such as the ‘Periplus of the Erythrean Sea’&nbsp;(Casson, 1989), and referred to as Muchiri, in Tamil&nbsp;Sangam poetry. While recent research points towards&nbsp;Pattanam, a place about 9 km upstream from&nbsp;Kodungallur, as a probable contender for the exact&nbsp;location of the ancient port (Cherian et al., 2014), even&nbsp;today, the reputation of Kodungallur as the entry point&nbsp;of multiple religions - Christianity, Judaism and Islam,&nbsp;into the Indian sub-continent from across the seas, is&nbsp;proudly cherished by the people of the locality.</span></p><img src="221_files/221-2.jpg" style="width:230pt;height:173pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">The Cheraman Perumal Mosque in Kodungallur, probably the earliest in India, its architecture providing testimony to&nbsp;the region's syncretic past (Picture: Own)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the various temples that dot the town, the one that attracts the most devotees today, almost&nbsp;eponymous with the town, is the Kodungallur Amma&nbsp;temple - dedicated to the Mother Goddess - the&nbsp;Mother of Kodungallur.</span></p><img src="221_files/221-3.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:131pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">The Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple or Sree Kurumba Kaavu (Picture: Own)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The temple, or ‘kaavu’ (sacred grove), has, in public perception, a kind of notoriety associated with its&nbsp;annual ‘Bharani’ festival - gained from the festival’s&nbsp;rather peculiar rituals. During the Bharani period,&nbsp;devotees in large numbers throng to the temple from&nbsp;distant areas, clad in vivid red, clanging sickles in their&nbsp;hands, singing profane songs. The culminating ‘Kaavu&nbsp;theendal’ ritual of the festival is widely commented on&nbsp;and studied.</span></p><img src="221_files/221-4.jpg" style="width:240pt;height:165pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">The Kaavu Theendal (Source: Wikipedia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was this site that the noted local historian, late Dr.N.M. Nampoothiri, former Dean of the Centre for&nbsp;Heritage Studies, Kerala, suggested to this researcher&nbsp;as a pilot. Over the years of 2014/2015, as I started&nbsp;gathering the history and lore related to Kodungallur&nbsp;and the temple from various sources, it was the&nbsp;Bharani rituals that stood out and piqued one’s&nbsp;curiosity the most - with its peculiarity, and yet, its&nbsp;unquestionable popularity that drew faithful crowds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Who’ were the people who came for this festival? What drew them? As I went through the articles&nbsp;written about the festival, I saw that theorizations&nbsp;ranged from it having been a practice instituted to&nbsp;drive out Buddhist monks, to the shrine being the&nbsp;memorial of the Silappathikaram protagonist Kannaki.&nbsp;But none of those served to explain the relevance of&nbsp;the festival today - why it continued to thrive and&nbsp;attract people. What also struck one was the contrast&nbsp;between the general perceptions about the festival,&nbsp;and the attitude of those intimately associated with&nbsp;the locality and the festival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In_ </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Limories,</span><span class="font4"> I have presented the Kodungallur Bharani, as I saw and experienced it, during 2014 and&nbsp;2015. My emphasis has not so much been on the past,&nbsp;as on the present, as I tried to capture what had&nbsp;fascinated me - the continuities and connections the&nbsp;locale and the festival had nurtured and preserved,&nbsp;across time and place.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The presentation - as a photo-narrative</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">A photo-narrative was decided on as the best approach to convey the richness of the festival, chosen&nbsp;after abandoning other text-based approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The photo-narrative had the advantage of being more accessible - both to the people I had sourced the&nbsp;content from, and to wider audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most Bharani participants speak Malayalam or Tamil. The crowd is mixed - literate and illiterate.&nbsp;While youngsters are familiar with English, the older&nbsp;people are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As I tried out various approaches to present my content, I realized that the photographs were the most&nbsp;evocative of all, and that weaving the narrative around&nbsp;those would help bridge literacy and language&nbsp;barriers, reaching out to young and old, local and&nbsp;global.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Excerpts</span></h1><img src="221_files/221-5.jpg" style="width:225pt;height:153pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Signboard on the platform of one of the numerous trees that surround the temple, indicating the locality of the group to&nbsp;assemble at this site, (Picture: Own)</span></p><img src="221_files/221-6.jpg" style="width:228pt;height:171pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">One of the groups assembled in 2014 (Picture: Own)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Validation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">Once the presentation had reached a logical point, in 2016, I returned to the various persons I had obtained&nbsp;information from, for their validation and feedback. I&nbsp;also had independent knowledgeable individuals&nbsp;review the content, to ensure I had captured key terms&nbsp;in the narrative correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The snapshots of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bepur group</span><span class="font4"> viewing the site, are below. One of the youngsters of this group had&nbsp;asked me, when I was gathering my content - “What&nbsp;will be the result of your research? Will we get to see&nbsp;it, or will it sit in some library that we cannot access?”</span></p><img src="221_files/221-7.jpg" style="width:219pt;height:160pt;"/><img src="221_files/221-8.jpg" style="width:221pt;height:167pt;"/>
<p><span class="font4">Although such an in-person validation was possible for the pilot site, as the system scales to multiple&nbsp;locations and contributors, as is the eventual goal,&nbsp;quantifiable and less resource-intensive methods of&nbsp;validation, using computational tools and systems as&nbsp;appropriate, will need to be implemented.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Future work</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Multi-Lingual Captions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The photo-narrative approach needs to be explored further, to include multi-lingual&nbsp;capability, especially in the narrative&nbsp;captions that will further increase&nbsp;accessibility.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semantics</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Working out the conceptual categories and a suitable meta-data taxonomy to describe&nbsp;the content, will be crucial to make&nbsp;Limories a ‘living' site. The diagram below&nbsp;depicts the overall process flow currently&nbsp;envisaged for the system.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scaling out</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In parallel, strategies to scale out to other sites also need to be worked out. A second</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">site has been chosen. The prospect of using local volunteers is also being explored.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Social media as a source?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As Limories scales out, it 'might', in due course, use appropriate and relevant social&nbsp;media content. However, a primary&nbsp;consideration, if so, would be&nbsp;appropriateness of content. A key intent of&nbsp;Limories is to reach out to all audiences,&nbsp;including children, for the younger&nbsp;generation to know the localities around&nbsp;them, and the associated memories they&nbsp;hold, better. Content would need to be&nbsp;accordingly appropriate.</span></p><img src="221_files/221-9.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:182pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Note: Chart to be read bottom-up</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Working out the conceptual categories and meta-data, is the next major stage in the Limories journey, as the&nbsp;chart illustrates. This, and scaling out to other sites,&nbsp;with controlled crowd-sourcing, are crucial next steps&nbsp;for Limories, seminal to realizing its vision, to help&nbsp;answer: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What is it that makes a place unique and&nbsp;special, to all the people in whose memories the&nbsp;place resides?</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
