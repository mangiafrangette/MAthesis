<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> (from Lat. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">vox</span><span class="font4"> 'voice', 'word') is an analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and visualisation dashboard for corpus-based research in lexical semantics. Currently developed as a Shiny application communicating with R session running in the background, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> provides users with possibly exhaustive account of how selected Latin word is&nbsp;distributed across the corpus and what can be told&nbsp;about its meaning. The application is built around a&nbsp;corpus which currently consists of ca. 200M words&nbsp;from texts dating from the Classical era (1 BCE) to the&nbsp;Middle Ages (14th CE). Although </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> was originally&nbsp;conceived as a tool of historical semantics research,&nbsp;the application - due to its modular design - may be&nbsp;modified and the code basis can be re-used in new research contexts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lexical Semantics with R</span></p><img src="114_files/114-1.jpg" style="width:227pt;height:109pt;"/>
<p><span class="font4">Information computed on a basis of a CWB-indexed corpus is presented to a user through a single-page interface composed of separate widgets arranged in a&nbsp;clear grid layout. Each widget is responsible for displaying in textual or graphical form a clear-cut property of word's distribution or meaning. A heavy use of&nbsp;data visualisation techniques renders </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> a convenient tool for exploratory analysis of textual corpora,&nbsp;but the grid layout is also reflection of modular architecture of the application. Each widget is implemented&nbsp;as a separate function which can be extended and&nbsp;adopted by researchers with even limited R programming skills.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use scenarios</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A typical use scenario is triggered when the user specifies a lemma to be looked up. If the search fails, a&nbsp;list of lemmas to choose from is provided. In case of&nbsp;success, neatly separated sections of the dashboard&nbsp;are populated with widgets, each of which corresponds to one sense or distributional property of the&nbsp;word under scrutiny.</span></p><img src="114_files/114-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:141pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 2: Voces. User Interface: Frequency Spectrum Plot (Voces. User Interface (tempus 'time')</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Word's frequency is summarised as a number of occurrences in the corpus (both raw and p.m.w.&nbsp;counts) and displayed as a highlighted point on a frequency spectrum plot (Baayen 2001). A barplot is provided for investigating change of frequency in subsequent corpus sections. Study of language variation is&nbsp;enabled through widgets presenting word's frequency&nbsp;as a function of such variables as author, work, genre,&nbsp;and - most importantly - time. Users are, therefore,&nbsp;provided with a list of authors who use the word most&nbsp;frequently or a word cloud summarising terms to be&nbsp;found in the titles of works with a particularly frequent&nbsp;use of the word under scrutiny. Genre variation is presented in form of a pie chart, while diachronic dimension - through a bar plot of frequency counts in partitions of the corpus. Diatopic variation study is still to&nbsp;be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A word's meaning potential can be investigated by means of a set of widgets presenting its contextual&nbsp;properties. The most frequent co-occurrences are enumerated on a simple count list which may be further&nbsp;analysed according to period and genre criteria. A Distributional Semantics Model (Baroni and Lenci 2010)&nbsp;is built from the corpus in order to enable simple&nbsp;meaning computation. Evert's (2014) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">wordspace</span><span class="font4"> package and a set of Alain Guerreau's scripts is employed&nbsp;in order to cluster co-occurrences. Similar terms of a&nbsp;looked up word are also computed and then presented&nbsp;in both textual and graphical form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Users are supported in data and visualisation interpretation through hints which accompany every widget. Their role is to explain not only what the data&nbsp;can mean, but also how the figures were computed,&nbsp;how one can interpret the geometrical properties of a&nbsp;plot, and so on. This, along with the availability of data&nbsp;sets, code snippets, and reports generated on the fly, is&nbsp;what makes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> a tool of reproductive research.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Architecture</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> was built as a Shiny application (Chang et al. 2016). Its development was greatly facilitated by the&nbsp;availability of a decent documentation and community&nbsp;support (both particularly useful when dealing with&nbsp;framework's complex reactivity model). It turned out&nbsp;soon, however, that it may not be the best choice for&nbsp;web application which has to combine heterogeneous&nbsp;data and non-R code as well. Hence, other solutions&nbsp;are being tested at the moment, those in particular&nbsp;which would provide, for example, more flexible integration of external APIs. The most promising seems to&nbsp;be OpenCPU (Ooms 2014), an application which exposes R session through a RESTful API. This approach&nbsp;allows any application written in some of the less or&nbsp;more popular web development frameworks to easily&nbsp;communicate with an R server instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As for the architecture, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> depends on a CQP server instance running in the background which requires corpora to be indexed with the CWB. Communication of the R server with the CWB is assured through&nbsp;the rcqp package (Desgraupes and Loiseau 2012)&nbsp;which offers a set of useful functions providing access&nbsp;to both positional (token-level) and structural (document-level) attributes. Unfortunately, development of&nbsp;this very helpful tool seems to be less active recently&nbsp;and thus </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> will soon accept also tabular data as input.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Previous research</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Nowadays, corpus linguists may chose from a vast array of free, open source and stable corpus query systems (CQS) which not only allow for efficient indexing&nbsp;of large corpora, but also provide a user-friendly concordance interface and offer out-of-the-box a set of&nbsp;such essential functionalities as collocation lists, simple corpus statistics etc. Both web (CQPweb,&nbsp;NoSketchEngine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font4">) and desktop applications (TXM&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font4">) are also usually equipped with a less or more intuitive corpus management interface. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4">, a dashboard for vocabulary research, is not yet another CQS&nbsp;and has no intention to supersede well-established&nbsp;tools which cannot be easily combated in terms of either robustness or speed. Quite the contrary, the application communicates with the CWB engine and&nbsp;adapts some of the design choices and features of the&nbsp;popular CQS, while hopefully does not inherit their&nbsp;drawbacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unlike the case of the well-known CQS, more emphasis has been put on quick access to multifaceted information rather than on close analysis of occurrences. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> does not attempt, then, to implement some of the features which are traditionally considered an important part of the corpus analytical&nbsp;toolbox, such as concordance sampling, sorting etc.&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the strength of popular CQS lies in their&nbsp;wide applicability: by default, they do not preclude any&nbsp;research scenario. Although agnostic of linguistic theory, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> was originally built for more specific purposes and focuses on semantic properties of the word&nbsp;and its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is believed to be one of the main advantages of the present application is that - thanks to its modular architecture - it can be easily extended or adopted&nbsp;by a researcher with even moderate programming&nbsp;skills. In that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> attempts to fill the gap that exists&nbsp;between, on the one hand, fully-blown CQS, which are&nbsp;normally quite conservative when it comes to adding</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">new features, and, on the other hand, single-purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">research workflows built </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc</span><span class="font4"> by researchers. What also distinguishes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> from other CQS is its emphasis&nbsp;on helping users to interpret data. A system of visual&nbsp;and textual hints keeps a researcher informed about&nbsp;where does the data come from, how have they been&nbsp;computed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The grid layout is well-known from analytical environment and is especially popular in finances or engineering (Few 2013); in humanities it was adopted, among others, in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Voyant Tools</span><span class="font4"> project. It offers a&nbsp;quick insight into otherwise dispersed data and a coherent account of word's properties.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Further research</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Voces</span><span class="font4"> is currently in an early stage of development. The work focuses on adding new functionalities and&nbsp;plotting types which may sometimes affect application's efficiency. Future work will focus on: (1) optimising user experience; (2) implementing tools for (a)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">comparative (ie. two-lemma) research and (b) tracking language change; (3) better processing user input (multi-word search).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
