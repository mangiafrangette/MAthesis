<p><span class="font5">The advent of new funding streams and initiatives within broader humanities scholarship indicate that&nbsp;the collaborative research approaches have diffused&nbsp;beyond digital humanities. This paper presents the&nbsp;findings of the “Humanities Collaboration and&nbsp;Research Practices: Exploring Scholarship in the&nbsp;Global Midwest” project (HCRP), which examines the&nbsp;Humanities Without Walls initiative as a case study for&nbsp;how innovative, interdisciplinary humanities research&nbsp;draws upon models from digital humanities.&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Humanities Without Walls</span><span class="font5"> (HWW) Global Midwest initiative supports collaborative research&nbsp;projects led by faculty from fifteen U.S. research&nbsp;universities in the Midwest. With its emphasis on&nbsp;multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration and&nbsp;applied research, HWW Global Midwest presents rich&nbsp;research cases on the evolving nature of humanities&nbsp;research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Studies of collaboration among digital humanities researchers and its impact on humanities scholarship&nbsp;have proliferated over the past decade (Siemens,&nbsp;2009; Siemens, 2011; Deegan &amp; McCarty, 2012; Given&nbsp;&amp; Wilson, 2015). Focused studies of DH research&nbsp;practices also examine credit and authorship&nbsp;(Nowviskie, 2011; Nowviskie, 2012), infrastructure&nbsp;needs (ACLS, 2006, Edmond, 2015), and project&nbsp;management (Leon, 2011). Building upon this&nbsp;research, our study examines how the collaborative&nbsp;experimentations undertaken by HWW Global&nbsp;Midwest researchers influenced their research&nbsp;practices, data sharing, and final outputs.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">The project team conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 researchers funded by the first&nbsp;round of HWW Global Midwest awards. Participants&nbsp;were asked about project goals, collaboration&nbsp;development, tools used for project management,&nbsp;challenges, and research approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The project team recorded and transcribed the interviews, and coded them in ATLAS.ti 7. Each&nbsp;transcription was coded multiple times for inter-coder&nbsp;reliability. This study applies a qualitative content&nbsp;analysis method that expands upon prior studies by&nbsp;Brockman et al. (2001), Palmer &amp; Neumann (2002),&nbsp;and Palmer (2005), as well as a grounded theory&nbsp;approach (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Findings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interviews with Global Midwest project awardees revealed a number of emerging practices and&nbsp;challenges common to the DH community and&nbsp;collaborative DH projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Project Workflows and Infrastructure</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The interviewed participants identified many project challenges within the HWW program model.&nbsp;These included finding personnel and eligible&nbsp;collaborators, aligning IRB approvals, and funding&nbsp;coordination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One participant summed up the sentiments of many on project management, saying “that was&nbsp;definitely a learning curve for all of us.” But most&nbsp;deemed this learning curve worth undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another key aspect of project workflows was the range of tools used by the HWW Global Midwest&nbsp;research groups (See Table 1). Tool selections ranged&nbsp;from cloud storage to unique platforms, including the&nbsp;software built for NINES and 18th Connect. But&nbsp;whether they used popular or specialized tools, one&nbsp;respondent's declaration captures their prevailing&nbsp;ethos: “We’re using an existing infrastructure and&nbsp;we're applying it in a quite different way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This process of translating tools to different uses is similar to the software adaptations seen in digital&nbsp;humanities research, and as scholars explore new&nbsp;ways to translate their research, they turn to multiple&nbsp;sources of expertise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Methods of Collaborative Analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many research groups carefully developed methods of analysis in ways that resonate with crossdisciplinary approaches in digital humanities&nbsp;research. One respondent characterized a group’s&nbsp;work as having “a lot of cross-fertilization of&nbsp;methodologies ... not so much about content.” Another&nbsp;project planned to employ several methods of&nbsp;analysis, including a short film, a series of interviews,&nbsp;and a performance of dancers and scholars rolling&nbsp;around on the floor “because to resist was not going to&nbsp;happen.” This type of collaborative process was&nbsp;described by one group as one that “unfolds in an&nbsp;uncertain and, in that sense, an egalitarian manner&nbsp;because no one knows yet what the thing will be.. You&nbsp;go on a hunch and you see where it takes you. That is&nbsp;typical of ethnography, but also, I think, of&nbsp;collaboration, as well.” These dynamic and educational&nbsp;elements of collaboration proved to be key to&nbsp;partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Student Engagement</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several interviews related a need for research assistance and dedicated project management, and&nbsp;respondents repeatedly attested to the value of&nbsp;graduate assistants who shouldered the management&nbsp;burden of the projects, or the (unfulfilled) need for&nbsp;such students. Projects navigated the tension between&nbsp;relying on student labor and acknowledging the&nbsp;intellectual contributions of the students with varying&nbsp;degrees of success, with the most positive assessment&nbsp;citing student participation as the true catalyst for&nbsp;collaborative practice: “They’re not just graduate&nbsp;students. They’re fellow collaborators in the project at&nbsp;this point and they have tremendous resources of&nbsp;knowledge, you know. The multiplication is enormous.&nbsp;It’s here that you really have the collaborating&nbsp;humanities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Digital Dissemination and Curation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respondents cited different formats for sharing their work, including performances, films, and&nbsp;websites as well as texts and presentations. Several&nbsp;respondents envisioned creating hybrid outputs, such&nbsp;as one respondent’s plan “to create some kind of&nbsp;interactive map [and] ideally a repository of sounds.”&nbsp;Another discussed the possibility of sharing interview&nbsp;data as a form of dissemination, noting that “we’re still&nbsp;processing the data [and] deciding how to feature it.&nbsp;we’re not tweeting the results or something like that.”&nbsp;This response also highlights the complex&nbsp;characteristics of humanities data, and the multiplicity&nbsp;of factors that must be considered for data sharing and&nbsp;archiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respondents also saw avenues for making broader impacts via use of different platforms. As one&nbsp;respondent explained, “I think we’ve contemplated&nbsp;scholarly output in the traditional platforms.&nbsp;whether they’re online or in print, but we have&nbsp;contemplated getting research into the hands of&nbsp;stakeholders who are not scholars.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Collaboration and Credit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many respondents were mindful of the importance of providing appropriate credit and recognition for&nbsp;project partners. One respondent noted that “for us,&nbsp;the notion of collaboration was built around the idea&nbsp;that both parties would be equally acknowledged.”&nbsp;Negotiating appropriate credit, however, also can&nbsp;reveal moments of tension within projects. Another&nbsp;respondent observed that “there was a little bit of&nbsp;misunderstanding, and some disagreements [.] had&nbsp;to do with who is being acknowledged for what.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respondents differed on their views of co-authored publications. One respondent noted, “I didn’t expect a&nbsp;lot of co-authoring, more of a co-design of the&nbsp;platform.” Another viewed co-authorship as an&nbsp;important “end product collaboration.” While&nbsp;discussion of evaluation for tenure and promotion&nbsp;were present within the interviews, they were not as&nbsp;prevalent as might be expected. Yet a key theme that&nbsp;emerged in the responses was that culture shifts&nbsp;within humanities disciplines are essential to&nbsp;advancing the acceptance of research collaborations&nbsp;and co-authorship in peer evaluation criteria.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Discussion and Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">To bring emergent humanities research collaborations into dialogue with the digital&nbsp;humanities, we propose a set of recommendations as&nbsp;a foundation for fostering rigorous interdisciplinary&nbsp;collaboration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Build stronger connections between teaching and research through engaging students in&nbsp;research collaborations: </span><span class="font5">Student participation in&nbsp;digital humanities projects has been essential to&nbsp;the growth of DH research, and humanities&nbsp;scholars can similarly bring collaborative research&nbsp;practice into the classroom in ways that&nbsp;acknowledge and recognize the students’ labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Experiment with new forms of dissemination that more accurately convey the full breadth of&nbsp;collaborative work: </span><span class="font5">HWW Global Midwest&nbsp;researchers frequently sought new ways for&nbsp;disseminating interdisciplinary research findings:&nbsp;In the same way that digital humanities&nbsp;researchers employ new formats for publishing&nbsp;research data and findings, humanities scholars&nbsp;can experiment with new forms that reflect&nbsp;interdisciplinary approaches. Scholars should also&nbsp;consider protocols for establishing credit and coauthorship, such as a negotiated project charter&nbsp;that establishes workflows for the collaboration,&nbsp;standards for co-authorship and a grievance&nbsp;process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Encourage a culture of sharing data and interim findings: </span><span class="font5">Administrators are in a key position to&nbsp;encourage shifts in humanities research practices&nbsp;by encouraging and explicitly ascribing value to&nbsp;related intellectual activities. Both leaders as well&nbsp;as researchers can encourage a culture of sharing&nbsp;data and interim phase research outputs that&nbsp;recognize the complexities of the communities and&nbsp;types of data in humanities research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Strategically expand institutional investments in humanities research collaborations in order&nbsp;to ensure research sustainability: </span><span class="font5">To ensure&nbsp;sustainable collaborations, administrators may&nbsp;need to make financial and structural investments,&nbsp;and key to these decisions is understanding the&nbsp;motivations and requirements of multiple&nbsp;stakeholder groups represented within a project.&nbsp;For example, some team members may require&nbsp;explicit funding to dedicate allocations of their&nbsp;time, while other team members may need support&nbsp;staff assistance to manage budgets and project&nbsp;documentation. Another avenue is to leverage the&nbsp;embedded collaborative power of regional,&nbsp;national, and international consortia in order to&nbsp;ensure research sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These recommendations drawn from our findings suggest that the expansion and sustainability of&nbsp;innovative research collaborations in the humanities&nbsp;has critical intersections with the evolving research&nbsp;practices of digital humanities research.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
