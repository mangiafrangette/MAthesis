<p><span class="font3">The Perseids Project is developing a platform on which students and scholars engage in collaborative&nbsp;acts of scholarship and research on ancient texts&nbsp;(Almas &amp; Beaulieu, 2016). A core value of the project&nbsp;is the focus on pedagogy and the development of&nbsp;undergraduates as researchers. This is complemented&nbsp;by an emphasis on reuse and sharing of tools, data and&nbsp;resources. We keep these values in mind as we develop&nbsp;infrastructure to support complex workflows for the&nbsp;production of new forms of digital publications that&nbsp;are both machine-actionable and human-understandable. In this paper we describe one specific&nbsp;research activity undergraduate students have been&nbsp;conducting on Perseids, the annotation of the social&nbsp;networks of mythological characters. We discuss how&nbsp;opportunities and challenges, both pedagogical and&nbsp;technical, have presented themselves throughout&nbsp;multiple iterations of this effort, and how we evolved&nbsp;the architecture, information structures, and&nbsp;pedagogical workflows in response. We will use our&nbsp;findings to guide future decisions on when to build or&nbsp;reuse tools, and to formulate empirically founded&nbsp;recipes and approaches for specific user scenarios and&nbsp;data types.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The social network annotation project was motivated by an interest in teaching how to produce&nbsp;interpretations of mythological figures and texts. As&nbsp;explained by Schacht, annotation is an activity that is&nbsp;well known to produce deep engagement with a text in&nbsp;the form of close reading while promoting&nbsp;collaboration and conversation among students&nbsp;(Schacht 2016). In this case, we needed to produce&nbsp;interpretations that would be anchored in the primary&nbsp;materials and allow for a representation at the&nbsp;conceptual level. We decided to annotate </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Smith's&nbsp;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and&nbsp;Mythology</span><span class="font3"> (Smith’s), which offers both a complete&nbsp;narrative for each figure and references to the primary&nbsp;sources on which the narrative is based. This allowed&nbsp;for a double learning outcome. For instance, students&nbsp;would observe that Scylla is directly connected only to&nbsp;first and second generation Titans who represent&nbsp;monstrous or rebellious aspects of nature such as&nbsp;Typhon (volcanoes) and Charybdis (whirlpools). In&nbsp;addition, by following and researching the references&nbsp;to the primary sources, students would note that&nbsp;ancient texts characterize Scylla with words such as&nbsp;“rabid”, “aggressive”, and “deadly”. In this way, students&nbsp;learned that mythological genealogies and social&nbsp;connections are the links which the Greeks made&nbsp;between different concepts represented by the&nbsp;mythological figures. By studying the words with&nbsp;which ancient texts characterize mythological figures,&nbsp;the students understood the value (positive or&nbsp;negative) associated with these concepts in Greek&nbsp;culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As we always look to reuse rather than build from scratch when possible, we developed an annotation&nbsp;workflow for this activity using </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hypothes.is,</span><span class="font3"> an&nbsp;existing open source annotation tool (on the use of&nbsp;Hypothes.is in the classroom, see Kennedy 2016) . We&nbsp;also selected the Standards for Networking Ancient&nbsp;Prosopographies (</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">SNAP</span><span class="font3">) ontology for representation&nbsp;of the social network in the annotations, and the Open&nbsp;Annotation (OA) data model for serialization of the&nbsp;data (Sanderson et al. 2013a) Hypothes.is lacked&nbsp;support for controlled vocabularies, but offered freeform text entry as well as tags, worked on any website,&nbsp;and provided an API for retrieval of the annotations.&nbsp;We prepared explicit tagging instructions for the&nbsp;students with rules that would enable us to apply the&nbsp;controlled terms and data model to the annotations.&nbsp;Students submitted lists of their annotation URIs to&nbsp;the Perseids platform for ingest, review and&nbsp;publication of the data. Perseids software retrieved the&nbsp;students’ data from the Hypothes.is API, and upon&nbsp;ingest, applied a transformation, producing OA-compliant annotations using the SNAP ontology. Once&nbsp;the annotations were approved by reviewers in&nbsp;Perseids, we exported the data for final publication via&nbsp;the GapVis interface, to which we added a social&nbsp;network visualization and support for Canonical Text&nbsp;Services data sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We completed two full annotation rounds with separate student groups using this workflow. A key&nbsp;finding from a review of the data from the first round&nbsp;was that the lack of ability to visualize the networks at&nbsp;the time of annotation left too much room for error in&nbsp;the directionality of the annotations (On the efficacy of&nbsp;visualization in computer-assisted learning, see Baek&nbsp;and Lane 1988). Despite having explicit instructions&nbsp;on how to identify the subject and object of the&nbsp;annotations, it was difficult for both the students and&nbsp;the reviewers to appreciate their importance without&nbsp;being able to see how their choices impacted the final&nbsp;data. We ended up, for example, with annotations&nbsp;which identified a mother as the son of her child. We&nbsp;tried to address this in the second round by providing&nbsp;even more precise instructions, but the same mistakes&nbsp;were made. Our instructions and transformation rules&nbsp;also became more complex because, having identified&nbsp;the pedagogical significance of the characterizations,&nbsp;we asked students to annotate them as well as the&nbsp;social network connections. Through this process it&nbsp;became clear that we were trying to use the&nbsp;Hypothes.is tool in a way which was very different&nbsp;from the use cases it was developed to support. As a&nbsp;result, we had a workflow which required too much&nbsp;focus on following complex written instructions. This&nbsp;detracted from the pedagogical effectiveness of the&nbsp;activity as well as the overall quality of the resulting&nbsp;annotation data.</span></p><img src="330_files/330-1.jpg" style="width:232pt;height:103pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. Plokamos network visualization based on students' annotations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of this experimentation phase, we undertook a process of surgical development to&nbsp;address these concerns. With a much clearer&nbsp;understanding of our requirements, and the&nbsp;importance of immediate, visual feedback to the&nbsp;annotation and review process, we developed a&nbsp;targeted interface for semantic annotation which&nbsp;would work on any source text and allow for the data&nbsp;network to be visualized during the annotation&nbsp;process (see Fig. 1). The tool we developed - Plokamos,&nbsp;which is Greek for &quot;something woven&quot; - is a Javascript&nbsp;application backed by an RDF-based triple store. The&nbsp;Plokamos interface is also designed for reuse in other&nbsp;workflows and by other teams. It can be embedded&nbsp;into an existing application and can be extended to&nbsp;support other ontologies and rdf-based annotation&nbsp;bodies. At all times, the data itself remains separate&nbsp;from the tool and available for export and reuse. The&nbsp;configuration is also externalized from the code, and&nbsp;managed, along with the data, as RDF graphs. In our&nbsp;current deployment of Plokamos we reuse Perseids’&nbsp;user model, the Nemo Citable Text Services text&nbsp;browsing interface, and the Apache Marmotta triple&nbsp;store, and we continue use of the OA data model and&nbsp;the SNAP ontology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We can also see the evolution and objectives of the project reflected in the underlying data structures of&nbsp;the annotations themselves. The annotations consist&nbsp;of a frame with metadata pertaining to their type,&nbsp;provenance and the targeted data source; linked from&nbsp;the frame is the annotation body containing the actual&nbsp;semantics of the annotation. We examine these&nbsp;structures at two architectural levels and from two&nbsp;usage perspectives.</span></p><img src="330_files/330-2.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:80pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2. Graph- and Resource-based anchoring of annotation bodies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In designing the body we considered different topologies (of the connection between body and&nbsp;frame; and of the body itself -- structural multiplicity,&nbsp;see Sanderson et al, 2013b) and the compromises they&nbsp;represent between clarity of the annotation body and&nbsp;ease of traversal between annotation frame and body.&nbsp;An annotation body can be embedded into a distinct&nbsp;and uniquely named graph which is referenced by the&nbsp;annotation frame (see Fig. 2 (a)); or it can be anchored&nbsp;through one or more identifying resources which are&nbsp;referenced as the annotation body (see Fig. 2 (b)). The&nbsp;former approach enables quick and easy delineation of&nbsp;individual annotations and allows for complex&nbsp;topologies with multiple graph components. The latter&nbsp;approach offers less flexibility in the structure and&nbsp;complexity of the individual annotations but linking&nbsp;the payload with intermediate resources provides&nbsp;easier pathways to their reuse in other graphs, queries&nbsp;and analyses.</span></p><img src="330_files/330-3.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:65pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 3. Transformation between machine-actionable and human-readable topologies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The need for the resulting annotation bodies to be understandable by humans as well as algorithmic&nbsp;processing is another factor impacting the data model.&nbsp;Both user groups have different requirements for the&nbsp;topology of the annotation data. Humans may prefer a&nbsp;more direct representation of the data in which objectrelational structures are left implicit, while algorithms&nbsp;are not only indifferent to indirect construction but&nbsp;benefit from a more explicit and formal description of&nbsp;the underlying data.</span></p><img src="330_files/330-4.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:78pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 4. Annotation interface for entry of social network data</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have used the design of the Plokamos’ user interface to help us mediate between these different&nbsp;perspectives. The interface guides the users through&nbsp;the annotation process with a simplified&nbsp;representation of entities and relations in the form of&nbsp;unadorned subject-predicate-object triples (Fig. 4),&nbsp;offering pre-configured choices to to help ensure data&nbsp;integrity, and we use a graph-based system of&nbsp;configuration to transform and expand to the more&nbsp;complex structures in the final annotation data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through this iterative approach to supporting the social network annotation activity, putting our core&nbsp;values of pedagogy and reuse front-and-center, we&nbsp;have been able to explore the pedagogical&nbsp;effectiveness of annotation as a learning method with&nbsp;a fairly low initial investment of resources. This&nbsp;allowed us to validate the importance of supporting&nbsp;this activity and refine our understanding of the&nbsp;architecture and data models that would be best suited&nbsp;to it. We were then able to approach the development&nbsp;of custom tools more efficiently, while still designing&nbsp;for maximum extensibility and reuse. The resulting&nbsp;web interface with its RDF-based data source and&nbsp;configuration can be used on a wide variety of existing&nbsp;classroom resources, and expanded upon to support&nbsp;new use cases with varying annotation body, target&nbsp;types, and visual representations.</span></p>
