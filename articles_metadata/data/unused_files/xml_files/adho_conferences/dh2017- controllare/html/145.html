<p><span class="font1">The Tasso in Music Project, currently funded by an NEH Scholarly Editions Grant (2016-2019), is an open-access and interactive digital platform that allows&nbsp;music historians, performers, and literary scholars to&nbsp;access and analyze late 16th- and early 17th-century&nbsp;settings of poetry by Torquato Tasso, arguably the&nbsp;most prominent literary figure of early modern Italy.&nbsp;The project has been realized by a team of scholars&nbsp;from North America and Europe, with the technical&nbsp;support of Stanford University's Center for Computer&nbsp;Assisted Research in the Humanities (CCARH) and&nbsp;UMass Amherst. Upon its completion, the Tasso in&nbsp;Music Project aims to provide upon critical editions of&nbsp;the about 650 extant musical settings of Tasso's&nbsp;poetry, the vast majority of which have never been&nbsp;edited before. These settings represent the work of&nbsp;over 100 composers from a variety of geographic&nbsp;areas and with different musical styles, and as such&nbsp;provide a snapshot of secular vocal music in an age in&nbsp;which it underwent profound transformations. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">addition, these settings shed light on Tasso's</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">extraordinary influence on the music of his time- an aspect of his reception that has received surprisingly&nbsp;little attention to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The editions, which constitute one of the largest digital repositories of Italian madrigals and related&nbsp;genres, are encoded with Humdrum software tailored&nbsp;specifically for the project by Stanford's CCARH. The&nbsp;editions are presented on the project's website in a&nbsp;variety of electronic formats, such as MEI, MuseData,&nbsp;MusicXML, MIDI, and PDF, among others. They can&nbsp;also be visualized online using Verovio, a recently&nbsp;developed SVG viewer for music encodings. The&nbsp;editions are accompanied by dynamic, in-score critical&nbsp;notes and by music and textual search tools developed&nbsp;by Stanford's CCARH that facilitate analysis of this&nbsp;repertoire. Some of these search tools- such as single&nbsp;pitch and melodic or rhythmic pattern- draw on&nbsp;CCARH's work for the Josquin Research Project, a&nbsp;platform for the analysis of Renaissance music that has&nbsp;received wide recognition in the early music&nbsp;community. Other tools are unique to the project,&nbsp;including those that allow users to run combined&nbsp;musical/textual and vertical sonority searches that are&nbsp;crucial for the study of this particular repertoire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The platform also features a substantial textual component, with TEI transcriptions of the poetic texts&nbsp;as they appear in the musical settings and in&nbsp;contemporaneous literary sources, both manuscript&nbsp;and printed. The textual apparatus allows for a&nbsp;dynamic visualization of literary variants, thus&nbsp;facilitating the collation of different sources. Thanks to&nbsp;this feature, the project will become an indispensable&nbsp;resource for literary scholars interested in the&nbsp;tradition and transmission of Tasso's poetry, as well as&nbsp;for music historians interested in tracking the literary&nbsp;sources from which composers may have drawn the&nbsp;texts they set to music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Tasso in Music Project addresses an interdisciplinary audience, bringing together two&nbsp;institutions invested in the development of digital&nbsp;platforms for musical and humanistic research as well&nbsp;as a group of scholars from the North America and&nbsp;Europe who form the project's editorial and advisory&nbsp;boards. As such, the project may serve as a model for&nbsp;institutional cooperation, opening avenues for&nbsp;interdisciplinary approaches to the creation of digital&nbsp;databases of music and poetry from the late&nbsp;Renaissance and early Baroque periods.</span></p>
