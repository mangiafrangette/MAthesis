<p><span class="font2">“It was as if these matters of objective and hard science provided an oasis for folks who did not want to clutter&nbsp;sharp, disciplined, methodical philosophy with&nbsp;considerations of gender, race and class-determined&nbsp;facts of life” (Earhart 2012, pg. 5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“There is something truly soul-destroying in the repeated discursive erasure of vulnerable identities&nbsp;whether in the media, on the street, in the classroom,&nbsp;or in the legislative chamber” (Wright 2015, 264).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recent instances involving the desecration of hallowed structures erected in remembrance of&nbsp;turbulent periods in the U.S. solidify the need for a call&nbsp;to action to enact historical recovery amidst the&nbsp;“ruins.” The ruins include the marginalization of&nbsp;subaltern agents within grand historical narratives,&nbsp;the propensity of the academy to view historical&nbsp;purveyors of intellectual thought as overwhelmingly&nbsp;European, and the invisibility of subaltern agents in&nbsp;traditional and digital archives. Sites of subaltern&nbsp;experience drift in and out of the historical record&nbsp;often leaving no tangible signifiers to how these events&nbsp;inform the racialized, gendered, and class based&nbsp;systems of power which influenced many of the&nbsp;negotiations that subaltern agents contended with in&nbsp;initiating action and decision-making in an oppressive&nbsp;world. Historical recovery in the digital humanities&nbsp;play a vital role in enabling users with access to new&nbsp;knowledge as well as helping to shape meaning and&nbsp;interpretation of the cataclysmic phenomena&nbsp;embedded within its mediums. Anelise Shrout’s call&nbsp;for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">history from below </span><span class="font2">is essential to creating digital&nbsp;content which enables accessibility and users&nbsp;potentiality of increased awareness of the historical&nbsp;underpinnings related to structural inequality- Shrout&nbsp;rightly declares that digital methodologies are ideally&nbsp;suited for these interventions (Shrout 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This panel offers several approaches to historical recovery through showcasing digital projects which&nbsp;utilize technologies designed to foreground subaltern&nbsp;histories while preserving contextual integrity. We&nbsp;bring together three approaches- geospatial, alternate&nbsp;reality gaming, and online digital collections for a&nbsp;conversation that will highlight the methods and&nbsp;values involved in the digitization, visualization, user&nbsp;interaction and theoretical analysis of content. Our&nbsp;panel consists of scholars who’ve developed&nbsp;interdisciplinary approaches in their area of inquiry&nbsp;emphasizing historical recovery as a focal point of&nbsp;their research: Anelise Shrout’s presentation explores&nbsp;the Digital Almshouse Project and argues for the&nbsp;importance of digital humanists bringing together&nbsp;new archival methods with the old while critically&nbsp;reading archival silences as opportunities for further&nbsp;recovery and analysis. Christy Hyman’s presentation&nbsp;highlights the ways that GIS recovers subaltern&nbsp;experience through the struggles of enslaved&nbsp;runaways in antebellum eastern North Carolina using&nbsp;the digital narrative The Oak of Jerusalem: Flight,&nbsp;Refuge, and Reconnaissance in the Great Dismal&nbsp;Swamp Region. Hilary Green’s paper examines digital&nbsp;collections alongside pedagogical approaches that&nbsp;introduce students to centering historically subaltern&nbsp;actors using intersectional strategies and inclusive&nbsp;pedagogies. Kathryn Kaczmarek-Frew illuminates&nbsp;opportunities available with alternate reality games in&nbsp;building adolescent’s historical knowledge by&nbsp;showcasing The Tessera, a game inspiring teens to&nbsp;take on the roles of real life scientists, programmers,&nbsp;and artists as they solve conceptual challenges while&nbsp;immersing themselves in a storyworld. Finally,&nbsp;Nishani Frazier discusses the conflictual relationship&nbsp;between the academy and the digital, the changing&nbsp;role of the scholar/expert, the importance of&nbsp;community in historical production, and the balance&nbsp;needed between recovery and shared authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In doing so, this panel promises to stimulate a lively and engaging discussion that will be informative to&nbsp;digital humanists of many fields. By presenting&nbsp;content and methods that connect subaltern humanity&nbsp;to recovery methods within the digital this panel helps&nbsp;forge the way for future work in gaining access to a&nbsp;more public facing scholarship that foregrounds the&nbsp;marginalized stories, agents, and actors into the digital&nbsp;humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All panelists have agreed to participate.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rehumanizing Data: Digital Methods Against Archival Violence</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0">Anelise Shrout</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Some of the most interesting historical subjects left only the faintest traces in the archive (Shrout 2016).&nbsp;When people of color, enslaved people, immigrants or&nbsp;women appear at all, it is often as commodified figures,&nbsp;ancillaries to those in power, or as undifferentiated&nbsp;masses of undesirable bodies. Scholars have recently&nbsp;begun to note that the archival silencing of these&nbsp;marginalized voices is not merely oversight, but&nbsp;rather, as Marisa Fuentes argues, a kind of epistemic&nbsp;violence. (Fuentes 2016). The absence of these&nbsp;subjects, these scholars note, is a feature, rather than a&nbsp;bug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This presentation proposes a set of digital humanities practices that explicitly work against the&nbsp;structures that kept those voices silent in the first&nbsp;place. It uses Digital Almshouse Project, a dataset of&nbsp;Irish immigrant who emigrated to North America to&nbsp;the port of New York in the 1840s. These men and&nbsp;women subsequently fell ill, became destitute, or were&nbsp;simply seen to be incompatible with New York’s public&nbsp;spaces. They were identified by public officials and&nbsp;sent (often forcibly) to New York’s Bellevue&nbsp;Almshouse - the only public health site that offered&nbsp;social services to people fleeing famine. In the process&nbsp;they were transformed; their diseases (a category&nbsp;which included the social maladies “recent emigrant”&nbsp;and “destitute”), their children (who they would often&nbsp;be separated from inside the almshouse) and the&nbsp;spaces of confinement to which they were sent&nbsp;transmuted from individual experience into&nbsp;bureaucratic data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This presentation uses the Digital Almshouse Project to rehumanize nineteenth-century&nbsp;immigrants. In doing so, it illustrates the ways in&nbsp;which scholars can bring “big data” analysis to bear on&nbsp;silenced voices; can use data visualization to resurrect&nbsp;archival ghosts; and can deploy quantitative analysis&nbsp;to give weight to historical actors long since written&nbsp;out of history. It asks that data-driven digital&nbsp;humanists pay particular attention to historical actors&nbsp;whose bodies were quantified and commodified, and&nbsp;who were in the process stripped of markers of&nbsp;humanity. Finally, it highlights historical bureaucratic&nbsp;spaces in which immigrants were able to enact agency,&nbsp;while also laying bare the ways in which the carceral&nbsp;state has used data to dehumanize marginalized&nbsp;subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The methods discussed in this presentation have roots in “history from below,” the “new social history”&nbsp;and cliometrics of the 1970s and 1980 (Gallman 1977,&nbsp;Shammas 1977, Darnton, 1984). Together, these&nbsp;methods sought to resurrect the stories of “people&nbsp;with no history,” by reconstructing their quotidian&nbsp;experiences. However, the subjects of these studies&nbsp;tended to only be relatively marginalized - they&nbsp;included (white, male) artisans, (white, male) voters,&nbsp;and (white) women property holders. There have&nbsp;been various resurgences and developments in these&nbsp;methods in the intervening four decades. These&nbsp;include practices of reading archives “against the&nbsp;grain” to get at the unstated assumptions that&nbsp;historical actors made about those they held power&nbsp;over. They also include theoretical approaches that&nbsp;advocate the reading of silences to understand those&nbsp;whose voices were intentionally obscured by official&nbsp;recorders and gatekeepers (Trouillot 1995, Bastian&nbsp;2003, Drake 2016). This presentation argues that we&nbsp;must bring together new archival methods and the old&nbsp;cliometrics; that we must critically read archival&nbsp;silences while simultaneously using regression&nbsp;models to coerce meaning from our data; that we&nbsp;should think about the motives of historical data&nbsp;creators, while we also use dataviz to trace historical&nbsp;actors’ pathways through hostile spaces. This&nbsp;presentation aims to not only theorize digital&nbsp;approaches to marginalized people, but to present a&nbsp;concrete toolkit for beginning to center the voices and&nbsp;experiences of those marginalized historical subjects.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">GIS as a Phenomenological Bridge to Experience: Deep Mapping the Enslaved&nbsp;Runaways of Eastern North Carolina</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0">Christy Hyman</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">My paper examines African American efforts toward cultural and political assertion in geographies&nbsp;of domination, specifically the Great Dismal Swamp&nbsp;area and adjacent communities in North Carolina&nbsp;during the long nineteenth century. Building on the&nbsp;work of archaeologists, historians, and novelists, my&nbsp;presentation reimagines space as it relates to the&nbsp;experiences of enslaved runaways and laborers who&nbsp;were exposed to the Great Dismal Swamp. I argue that&nbsp;the proximity of the Great Dismal Swamp increased&nbsp;the incidence of flight despite the danger and overall&nbsp;inhospitable nature of that landscape. In examining&nbsp;African Americans who navigated the landscapes of&nbsp;trauma inherent in the institution of slavery within the&nbsp;eastern North Carolina region, this study sheds light&nbsp;on the common values, aspirations, culture, and&nbsp;economic systems of a people relegated to the margins&nbsp;of society. This investigation into the spatial&nbsp;dimensions of flight within the Great Dismal Swamp,&nbsp;with the use of historical primary sources, generates&nbsp;new knowledge about the enslaved experience. This&nbsp;approach highlights and analyzes space itself with a&nbsp;view to uncovering the social relationships embedded&nbsp;in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Focusing on enslaved runaways' proximity to waterways and the natural environment within the&nbsp;Great Dismal Swamp, this project uses Esri Story Maps&nbsp;to tell the digital narrative of The Oak of Jerusalem:&nbsp;Flight Refuge and Reconnaissance in the Great Dismal&nbsp;Swamp Region, a project containing maps with&nbsp;narrative text, images, and multimedia content. The&nbsp;data contained within this digital narrative was&nbsp;gathered from nineteenth-century North Carolina&nbsp;newspapers such as the Cape Fear Mercury, Carolina&nbsp;Observer, Edenton Gazette, and many others which&nbsp;provided information on the destinations and&nbsp;distributions of enslaved runaways, including&nbsp;frequency distribution of enslaved runaways by&nbsp;month of disappearance and gender specificity. In&nbsp;terms of the Great Dismal Swamp landscape, content&nbsp;will include remote sensing data, forest dynamics of&nbsp;the swamp, soil characteristics, and animal species&nbsp;such as amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Taking&nbsp;these physical properties of space together with the&nbsp;historical descriptions of enslaved runaway ads and&nbsp;cross-referencing this information with textual&nbsp;descriptions in the enslaved narratives written by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moses Grandy and Harriet Jacobs, a complete reality of what was at stake for an enslaved person to run away&nbsp;emerges. Because these seemingly disparate elements&nbsp;of space (and the social relationships embedded&nbsp;within) are scattered across the archival landscape,&nbsp;my project brings all these things together in one&nbsp;setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Geospatial technologies are central to this study because of the ways that GIS can be a&nbsp;phenomenological bridge between subaltern&nbsp;experience and measurable qualities of the Great&nbsp;Dismal Swamp landscape. Using geoprocessing&nbsp;methods employed with ArcGis tools a cost surface&nbsp;was developed to investigate the ways enslaved&nbsp;people appropriated the landscape into areas of refuge&nbsp;and reconnaissance and eventual escape. A cost&nbsp;surface is a geospatial technique based on measuring&nbsp;the effort it takes to cross a landscape area. Data&nbsp;contained within a DEM (Digital Elevation Model)&nbsp;representing the Great Dismal Swamp landscape&nbsp;allows for this form of spatial analysis. The cost&nbsp;surface can thus be used to find the path between&nbsp;identified points along the surface with the least&nbsp;amount of effort. In measuring “cost” for enslaved&nbsp;people during the antebellum era four sets of variables&nbsp;were attained:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cumulative distance- total distance to travel&nbsp;from one place to another</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duration or travel time- total time to travel&nbsp;from one place to another</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energetic expenditures or calories- total&nbsp;calories expended to travel from one place&nbsp;to another</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiential/Cultural- abstract measures&nbsp;such as visibility between sites, social&nbsp;distance, and spheres of influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through Moses Grandy and Harriet Jacob’s dynamic reminiscences, the extant data on enslaved runaways&nbsp;near the Great Dismal Swamp, and the physical&nbsp;properties of space within the Great Dismal Swamp&nbsp;landscape the shadowy foundations of how the Great&nbsp;Dismal Swamp functioned as a quasi-dystopian&nbsp;landscape for enslaved people is recovered. Ultimately&nbsp;the swamp embodied the promise of freedom as a site&nbsp;of possible refuge, but also the horrors of the slavery&nbsp;regime itself.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Disrupting the Archive: Intersectionality and the Integration of the Digital Humanities in&nbsp;the Classroom</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0">Hilary Green</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">In today’s classroom, gender and race scholars strive to provide students with a breadth of&nbsp;scholarship that represent the social, cultural, and&nbsp;political experiences that define both the American&nbsp;and global experiences. For scholar-activists working&nbsp;at large southern PWIs, the politicized tensions&nbsp;present in society today stemming from difficult racial&nbsp;pasts, and potential efforts at truth and reconciliation,&nbsp;all compel us to reconsider what sources will most&nbsp;impact students’ understanding of these difficult&nbsp;subjects. To effectively educate students, instructors&nbsp;do well to expose them to diverse historical&nbsp;documents, assignments, and approaches. Digital&nbsp;humanities offer new opportunities and challenges as&nbsp;eloquently expressed by Tara McPhersons’ “Why Are&nbsp;the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the&nbsp;Histories of Race and Computation.” This conference&nbsp;presentation will explore how to use engaging&nbsp;assignments (spatial analysis projects using Carto and&nbsp;documentary history projects) and digital archive&nbsp;collections to introduce students to a variety of&nbsp;sources using intersectional approaches and inclusive&nbsp;pedagogies that are used to critically engage students&nbsp;from diverse backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Digital archive collections offer scholars a valuable service by providing an online platform to publish&nbsp;digital archives. Managing content is no easy task and&nbsp;scholars as well as institutions have to find resources&nbsp;and time to develop their sites in a way that&nbsp;encourages curiosity, usability, and scholarly utility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Colored Conventions is an excellent archival addition to the digital humanities. Colored&nbsp;Convention’s purpose deserves quoting in full:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“This project seeks to not only learn about the lives of these mostly male delegates, the places where they&nbsp;met and the social networks that they created but to&nbsp;also account for the crucial work done by Black&nbsp;women in the broader social networks that made&nbsp;these conventions possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ColoredConventions.org endeavors to transform teaching and learning about this historic collective&nbsp;organizing effort—and about the many leaders and&nbsp;places involved in it—bringing them to digital life for&nbsp;a new generation of undergraduate and graduate&nbsp;students and researchers across disciplines, for high&nbsp;school teachers, and for community members&nbsp;interested in the history of church, educational and&nbsp;entrepreneurial engagement” (Colored Convention,&nbsp;2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As evidenced by Colored Convention’s purpose their aims are to reach a broad audience which refers&nbsp;to the public humanities focus of the project. The site&nbsp;has teaching aids, curriculum guides, as well as the&nbsp;primary source documents that have been recovered&nbsp;from relative obscurity. What Colored Conventions&nbsp;does is recover an entire archive of action performed&nbsp;by antebellum era African Americans taking initiative&nbsp;to move closer to freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the context of pedagogy, intersectionality asks students to think beyond narrow binaries that&nbsp;overdetermine contemporary discourse on identity&nbsp;and power (Risam, 2016). For particularly vulnerable&nbsp;populations who have historically experienced&nbsp;economic disadvantages the disciplines under the&nbsp;humanities does not at first glance offer a high upward&nbsp;mobility. How then can the humanities compete and&nbsp;attract a diverse array of students as well as engage&nbsp;scholars toward its humanistic offerings? In engaging&nbsp;digital archive collections centering marginalized&nbsp;people’s histories it becomes necessary to interrogate&nbsp;the archive, recover subaltern experience, and&nbsp;reimagine new approaches to historical&nbsp;interpretation. In doing these things fresh&nbsp;perspectives unfold as the humanities discipline as a&nbsp;whole is invigorated with scholarly interest. Students&nbsp;and scholars alike find new purpose in the humanities.&nbsp;These new questions coupled with the innovation in&nbsp;toolmaking within the digital invite a wealth of&nbsp;promise through intersectional approaches and&nbsp;inclusive pedagogies.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Casting our Lights Before: Immersion as Access in The Tessera ARG</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0">Kathryn Kaczmarek-Frew</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">“They say that coming events cast their shadows before. May they not sometimes cast their lights&nbsp;before?” -- Ada Lovelace</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Computer science and the technology industry are often regarded as the bastion of white men. However,&nbsp;there is a movement in popular culture to recover and&nbsp;make visible the contributions of women and&nbsp;minorities, from the major motion picture Hidden&nbsp;Figures to the AMC series Halt and Catch Fire. Still&nbsp;more active methods can be used to connect today’s&nbsp;youth to the realities of the past and the promise of the&nbsp;future. Alternate reality games provide a unique&nbsp;opportunity to combine historical knowledge and&nbsp;skill-building in a way that pervades into daily life. In&nbsp;my presentation, I will show how our alternate reality&nbsp;game The Tessera invites teen players to develop a&nbsp;more nuanced understanding of computer history&nbsp;while demonstrating that they already possess the&nbsp;computational thinking skills to make a future in the&nbsp;industry accessible to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Developed as a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Brigham Young University,&nbsp;and the Computer History Museum under a grant from&nbsp;the National Science Foundation, The Tessera ARG&nbsp;uses the genre of Victorian gothic realism and the&nbsp;trope of haunting to think about the influence of the&nbsp;past on the present. The narrative focuses on the&nbsp;ghost of Ada Lovelace recruiting teenage players,&nbsp;particularly those from demographics&nbsp;underrepresented in STEM disciplines, to join her&nbsp;secret society known as The Tessera in their fight&nbsp;against an even more mysterious destructive force&nbsp;known as S. Racing against time, players complete a&nbsp;series of collaborative puzzles emphasizing&nbsp;computational thinking skills such as pattern&nbsp;recognition, decomposition (breaking down a&nbsp;problem into smaller steps), algorithmic design, and&nbsp;data representation. By emphasizing the STEAM&nbsp;values of innovation and creativity as the key to&nbsp;progress, The Tessera helps players recognize that&nbsp;they already do computational thinking and that they&nbsp;can have a future in the technology industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Like many ARGs, The Tessera distributes its narrative across several media, presenting different&nbsp;opportunities for immersion. The Tessera: Ghostly&nbsp;Tracks is a real-life experience in the Computer&nbsp;History Museum, where classes will divide into groups&nbsp;to use digital clues and physical artifacts in the&nbsp;Revolution exhibit to solve computational thinking&nbsp;puzzles and discover which famous figures from&nbsp;computer history are haunting the museum. Players&nbsp;will experience a highly embodied sense of immersion&nbsp;as they move around the exhibit and manipulate props&nbsp;to solve the puzzles, such as decoding the message&nbsp;etched on the top of a chessboard or using a code to&nbsp;open the six padlocks on an “enchanted” crate,&nbsp;releasing the ghosts from the museum. In contrast,&nbsp;The Tessera: Light in the Shadows is an online game in&nbsp;which Ada guides players through the ruins of a&nbsp;decaying Victorian pub into the Tessera stronghold of&nbsp;Horsley Towers to create new innovations inspired by&nbsp;key inventions from history (such as the telegraph, the&nbsp;metric system, and Wi-Fi) to thwart S’s destruction.&nbsp;The online game requires imaginative recentering to&nbsp;immerse the player within the storyworld, aided by&nbsp;the use of first person perspective, tension-inducing&nbsp;time limits, and the invitation to write themselves into&nbsp;the narrative through the public-facing wiki (Ryan&nbsp;1992). While the goal is for players’ personal&nbsp;investment in the Tessera’s struggle to translate into&nbsp;learning, I’m interested in studying how the different&nbsp;avenues of immersion in the two experiences&nbsp;influence players, not only in their interest in the game&nbsp;content but also their self-perception of their&nbsp;computational thinking skills. This research will allow&nbsp;future game designers to think about how different&nbsp;kinds of simulations (physical, digital, augmented, and&nbsp;virtual) can be used for historical reconstruction to&nbsp;help players best access the realities of buried pasts.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Power to the People: Recovery and Shared Authority in Civil Right Movement Digital&nbsp;Work</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0">Nishani Frazier</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">African American Studies, public history, and oral history methodologies play central roles in the&nbsp;recovery of fairly unknown aspects of civil rights&nbsp;movement history. However, this merger also&nbsp;required a philosophical embrace of community&nbsp;engagement, power sharing, and open access during&nbsp;historical production. Though these ideals may fit&nbsp;within digital humanities, historical practice among&nbsp;academics is at odds with this approach. This talk&nbsp;discusses the conflictual relationship between the&nbsp;academic and digital, the changing role of the&nbsp;scholar/expert, the importance of community in&nbsp;historical production, and the balance needed&nbsp;between recovery and shared authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theorizing African American Public History</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Through the Digital Humanities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Expanding public understanding about the history of the Congress on Racial Equality community&nbsp;organization and economic development through&nbsp;access to primary sources, teacher resources, and&nbsp;mapping is the resource cornerstone within this&nbsp;project. It acts to recover a little known aspect about&nbsp;CORE and its relationship to racial uplift and economic&nbsp;development while providing access for future&nbsp;scholars and other interested persons. This process is&nbsp;a model for intersecting African American scholarship&nbsp;and digital humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The digital representation Harambee City illustrates this philosophy through:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. Broad accessibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing a second layer of learning through&nbsp;open access to primary sources and teacher&nbsp;lesson plans</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge sharing - commentary/exchange on&nbsp;the website</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community organization training</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The aim of this project is to promulgate further inquiry within historical study of the Civil Rights&nbsp;Movement as well as contemporary interventions&nbsp;concerning social justice issues (Frazier 2016).&nbsp;Following on Jessica Marie Johnson’s call to action&nbsp;regarding the urgent need for the digital humanities to&nbsp;engage with society’s “marginalized or discriminated&nbsp;against” this project endeavors to fulfill historical as&nbsp;well as justice imperatives needed within the digital&nbsp;humanities by examining civil rights movement&nbsp;history not commonly centered (Dinsman 2016).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Notes</span></h2>
