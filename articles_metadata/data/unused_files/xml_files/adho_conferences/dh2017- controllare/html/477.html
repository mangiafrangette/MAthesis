<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Digital Humanities from Scratch: A Pedagogy-Driven&nbsp;Investigation of an&nbsp;In-Copyright Corpus</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Brian Croxall</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Following the publication of Franco Moretti’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">GrapHs, Maps, Trees</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">,</span><span class="font2"> scholars looking to apply digital&nbsp;humanities methods to literature have increasingly&nbsp;been drawn to “distant reading.” The influence of&nbsp;distant reading in digital humanities is apparent not&nbsp;only in the work it has inspired (see, among others,&nbsp;Cordell and Smith; Elson, Dames, and McKeown;&nbsp;Jockers; Long and So; Rhody; and Underwood) but also&nbsp;for its regular inclusion as a method in courses&nbsp;introducing DH. “Teaching digital humanities,” it turns&nbsp;out, often means “teaching distant reading.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Teaching students the techniques of distant reading can be challenging as it depends on re-framing&nbsp;the familiar object of study. But another difficulty&nbsp;altogether is that this approach depends on a digitized&nbsp;corpus; and such a corpus, in turn, depends on&nbsp;someone, somewhere doing the difficult labor of&nbsp;digitization. One might ask, then: if “teaching digital&nbsp;humanities” means “teaching distant reading,”&nbsp;shouldn’t it also mean “teaching digitization”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this paper, I will discuss a </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">collaborative, multiyear assignment</span><span class="font2"> that I conducted in two of my “Introduction to Digital Humanities” courses at Emory&nbsp;University: the digitization and analysis of the&nbsp;complete works of Ernest Hemingway (Croxall). With&nbsp;the goal of teaching my students not only how to do&nbsp;distant reading but also about the intense labor that&nbsp;goes into corpus preparation, we digitized the whole&nbsp;of Hemingway’s work in just two weeks. Working from&nbsp;newly purchased copies of the texts, the students and&nbsp;I rapidly scanned hundreds of pages, performed and&nbsp;corrected optical character recognition, and&nbsp;assembled a corpus—with each of us spending no&nbsp;more than 4 hours on the task. Our from-scratch&nbsp;corpus was composed expressly so we could draw&nbsp;important distinctions among Hemingway’s works:&nbsp;individual works vs the whole collection; fiction vs&nbsp;non-fiction; and works published before while&nbsp;Hemingway was alive vs those that appeared after his&nbsp;death in 1961. I will detail what we learned from rapid&nbsp;digitization and how those lessons affected the second&nbsp;iteration of the assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After preparing the corpus, students worked in groups to analyze the many works of Hemingway that&nbsp;they had not had time to read. Making use of </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Voyant&nbsp;Tools</span><span class="font2">, they identified themes in the corpus and&nbsp;charted patterns that could never have been observed&nbsp;through regular, close reading methods. For example,&nbsp;the class confirmed that while Hemingway insists on&nbsp;writing about “men,” the women to whom they are&nbsp;attached are inevitably just “girls.” In an attempt to&nbsp;chart the patterns of Hemingway’s diction, another&nbsp;group of students investigated the terms he uses to&nbsp;introduce dialogue. Unsurprisingly, the students&nbsp;discovered that “said” is by far the most frequent such&nbsp;term across the entire corpus. What was more&nbsp;surprising, however, was to observe that in late and&nbsp;posthumous writings, the frequency of “said” suddenly&nbsp;drops by 50%. In short, by building our own corpus&nbsp;from scratch, the students were able to conduct&nbsp;original research, something that is relatively rare for&nbsp;many undergraduates in humanities programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Building our collection of texts from scratch had two critical advantages. First, we were able to create a&nbsp;small, relatively clean corpus whose provenance we&nbsp;knew. This provided a sense of confidence in the data&nbsp;as we began to distant read. Furthermore, while our&nbsp;analysis of Hemingway’s works was “distant”&nbsp;compared to traditional close reading of a single novel&nbsp;or story, it was not nearly as distant as projects that&nbsp;deal with several thousand texts. We became engaged,&nbsp;in short, in close-distant reading. Second, digitizing the&nbsp;texts ourselves allowed us to skirt a problem that&nbsp;frequently plagues distant reading texts from the&nbsp;twentieth century: copyright. As an educational&nbsp;endeavor focused on teaching the students how to&nbsp;prepare their research materials, this guerilla&nbsp;digitization project fell under the regime of fair use in&nbsp;the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To close, I will discuss how students at Brown University and I have taken further steps with the&nbsp;Hemingway corpus and with their digital humanities&nbsp;education as we have used it as a means to explore the&nbsp;methods and utility of topic modeling. Topic modeling&nbsp;is frequently deployed to come to terms with large and&nbsp;unwieldy corpora (see Jockers; Nelson; Nelson,&nbsp;Mimno, and Brown; Underwood and Goldstone). But&nbsp;working with a small, relatively clean corpus that is&nbsp;created from scratch allows students to better&nbsp;understand what takes place via unsupervised&nbsp;machine learning. At the same time, topic modeling&nbsp;allows us to ask in a new way some of the same&nbsp;questions that my former students had already&nbsp;uncovered: how does Hemingway’s dialog differ from&nbsp;his prose? how different are the topics in Hemingway’s&nbsp;fiction from those of his non-fiction? to what degree&nbsp;does his late—or even posthumous—work differ from&nbsp;what he wrote three decades earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the end, the process of modeling Hemingway becomes a means by which we can model all of digital&nbsp;humanities—both analysis and corpus creation—in a&nbsp;student-focused environment (see also Brier; Croxall&nbsp;and Singer; Harris; Hirsch; Jewell and Lorang; and&nbsp;Swafford). By doing digital humanities from scratch,&nbsp;students can be engaged in original research and see&nbsp;for themselves, from start to finish, how digital&nbsp;humanities gets done.</span></p>
