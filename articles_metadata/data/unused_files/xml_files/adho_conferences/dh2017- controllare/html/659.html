<p><span class="font3">This hands-on tutorial introduces humanists to CATMA (Computer Aided Text Markup and Analysis),&nbsp;a tool developed at the University of Hamburg and currently used by over 60 research projects worldwide.&nbsp;CATMA offers a unique combination of three main features found in no other text analysis tool:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CATMA supports </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">collaborative annotation and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">analysis </span><span class="font3">- a text or text corpus can be investigated individually, but also jointly by a group of students or researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CATMA supports </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">explorative, non-deterministic practices of text annotation </span><span class="font3">- a discursive, debate-oriented approach to text annotation based on the research practices of hermeneutic disciplines is the underlying conceptual model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CATMA integrates </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">text annotation and text analysis </span><span class="font3">in a web-based working environment - which makes it possible to combine the identification of textual phenomena with their investigation in a seamless,&nbsp;iterative fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What sets CATMA apart from other digital annotation methods is its ‘undogmatic' approach: the system does neither prescribe defined annotation schemata&nbsp;or rules, nor does it force the user to apply rigid&nbsp;yes/no, right/wrong taxonomies to texts (even though&nbsp;it allows for more prescriptive schemata as well). Rather, CATMA's logic invites users to explore the richness and multi-facettedness of textual phenomena according to their needs: Users can create, expand, and&nbsp;continuously modify their own individual tagsets - so&nbsp;if a text passage invites more than one interpretation,&nbsp;nothing in the system prevents assigning multiple, or&nbsp;even contradictory annotations. Despite all this flexibility, CATMA does not produce idiosyncratic annotations: All markup data can be exported in TEI/XML-format and reused in other contexts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since CATMA is a highly intuitive tool, it is also suitable for humanists with little technical knowledge: the GUI allows for a quick kick-off, and CATMA's query&nbsp;builder (a step-by-step dialogue-based widget) helps&nbsp;users retrieve complex information from texts without&nbsp;having to learn a query language. Another plus on the&nbsp;easy-to-use side is the fact that CATMA's automated&nbsp;distant-reading functions are continuously enhanced&nbsp;and extended - the current version 5.0 already features a number of automated annotation routines,&nbsp;among others the identification of basic narrative features in texts.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The aim of the tutorial</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In our half-day tutorial, we will introduce the core annotation and analysis functionalities of CATMA and&nbsp;show how they can be combined with the annotations&nbsp;provided automatically. Participants will be taken in a&nbsp;step-by-step, hands-on approach through the full cycle&nbsp;of a CATMA-based text investigation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">From text upload to initial textinvestiga-tions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">then to annotation and specification of annotation categories,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">from there to combined text queries that&nbsp;consult the source text and its annotations in combination,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and finally to the visual output of queryresults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a later phase of the tutorial, participants will</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">have the opportunity of testing the tool with regards to their own research interests: They can annotate&nbsp;their own texts or annotate collaboratively a text we&nbsp;will provide. We would also like to engage participants&nbsp;in a critique of CATMA's design and components as&nbsp;well as a general discussion about requirements for&nbsp;text analysis tools in their fields of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The primary users of CATMA are literary scholars, as well as graduate and undergraduate students of Literary Studies. Nevertheless, this tutorial is likely to be&nbsp;of interest also to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">humanities scholars of ALL fields concerned with text analysis (with and without experience in digital&nbsp;text analysis),</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">software developers in the humanities interested in non-deterministic text analysis and automated annotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Participants need no prior knowledge of digital text annotation and can work with their own laptop computers and their own digital texts. CATMA runs on Laptop or PC (Windows, Unix or MacOS) with a current&nbsp;web browser (MS Explorer or Edge; Firefox, Chrome,&nbsp;Safari) with a mouse or touchpad. Touchscreen navigation is not yet supported (but in the pipeline!). The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">room in which the workshop takes place should accommodate 25-30 people and provide WLAN and a projector.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Tutorial Instructors</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">All tutorial instructors come from the developing team of the CATMA project and/or the forTEXT project&nbsp;that is building a platform starting from CATMA. We&nbsp;have been presenting and teaching CATMA on various&nbsp;national and international occasions in the last years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Evelyn Gius</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Evelyn is working in the field of Digital Humanities as a researcher and has been involved in the creation&nbsp;of CATMA from the very beginning. Her research focus&nbsp;is on manual and automated text analysis. For her PhD&nbsp;project in Literary Studies she has explored with&nbsp;CATMA the benefits of applying narratological categories from literary studies to the analysis of narrations&nbsp;of labor conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jan Horstmann</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jan uses CATMA as a tool for textual analysis in literature studies and narratology. Currently he is investigating works of Goethe with a combination of distant and digital close reading methods. His focus is to improve the usability of digital tools for people with little&nbsp;or no prior knowledge of computing or programming,&nbsp;i.e. researchers from classical literature studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Janina Jacke</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Janina Jacke has worked in the heureCLEA project (2013-2016) that was aimed at developing automated&nbsp;annotation routines for CATMA. Since her research focuses on narratology and theory of interpretation, her&nbsp;main interest in the DH-context lies in working out the&nbsp;theoretical prerequisites for automated literary annotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jan Christoph Meister</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chris is Professor of German literature with a main research focus in the Digital Humanities. As original inventor of CATMA, he has led several projects concerned with the annotation and visualization of literary data and the development and enhancement of&nbsp;DH-tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Marco Petris,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Marco is a computer scientist with a strong affinity for the humanities and has been engaged in the creation of CATMA from the very beginning. As a research&nbsp;developer he is involved in all aspects of the design and&nbsp;implementation of tools for the Digital Humanities.</span></p>
