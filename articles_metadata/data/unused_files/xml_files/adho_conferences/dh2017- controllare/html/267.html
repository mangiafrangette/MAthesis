<p><span class="font4">Over the last several years, spatial humanities have grown in prominence. Initiatives such as the&nbsp;University of Virginia’s Institute for Enabling&nbsp;Geospatial Scholarship and Stanford’s Spatial History&nbsp;Project have signaled and begun exploring the impact&nbsp;of the spatial turn. Writing for UVA’s institute, historian&nbsp;Jo Guildi states, “The spatial turn represents the&nbsp;impulse to position these new tools [i.e. GIS] against&nbsp;old questions” (Guildi, 2010). In this panel, we&nbsp;challenge the idea that the spatial turn simply asks old&nbsp;questions and rather argue that it helps pose new as&nbsp;well as answer old questions in twentieth-century&nbsp;American history. In particular, we employ the idea of&nbsp;deep mapping as theorized by historian David&nbsp;Bodenhemer to discuss new scholarship and&nbsp;directions in digital spatial analysis. We also explore&nbsp;the role public humanities plays in framing these&nbsp;projects. The 45-minute panel entitled “Mapping the&nbsp;20 th Century United States” will focus on the role of&nbsp;the spatial analysis in the digital, public humanities&nbsp;and its impact on historical scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Robert Nelson will begin the panel with “Reckoning with Redlining: Public Engagement with ‘Mapping&nbsp;Inequality.’” The Mapping Inequality project provides&nbsp;unparalleled access to the infamous redlining maps&nbsp;and area descriptions created by the Home Owners’&nbsp;Loan Corporation during the Great Depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Accessed by tens of thousands of visitors in the first two weeks following its release, this paper will draw&nbsp;upon hundreds of contributions to a public&nbsp;conversation about redlining and urban inequality&nbsp;around “Mapping Inequality” in social media and the&nbsp;comment threads of press the project has received.&nbsp;Nelson will analyze the design decisions he and his&nbsp;colleagues made to prompt public engagement with&nbsp;these maps and the history of redlining. He will also&nbsp;critically use the reaction to the project to critically&nbsp;assess how successful this public-facing digital&nbsp;humanities project has been in prompting productive&nbsp;conversations about redlining and urban and racial&nbsp;inequalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Continuing with our exploration of the 1930s, we will turn to Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton who will&nbsp;discuss combining archives spatially in order to&nbsp;produce new knowledge about and public access to&nbsp;documentary expression in the era. They will focus on&nbsp;layering the Federal Writer’s Project, which&nbsp;documented through text the life histories of&nbsp;thousands of Americans, with 170,000 photographs&nbsp;from the Farm Security Administration-Office of War&nbsp;Information. Placing these archives for the first time in&nbsp;conversation, their deep maps incite new questions&nbsp;about the role of the federal government in&nbsp;documenting the lived experiences of Americans&nbsp;during the Great Depression and the types of&nbsp;representation produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next we will turn to the work of Jason Heppler on post-war America. Silicon Valley represented one of&nbsp;the twentieth century’s greatest modernizations of&nbsp;urban space. Beginning in the 1950s, the formation of&nbsp;a new high tech suburbanism led the Valley to become&nbsp;identified not only with a center of hopeful possibility&nbsp;as the Industrial Age industries of the Midwest and&nbsp;Northeast began to decline, but also gave expression to&nbsp;an environmental politic that attempted to reconcile&nbsp;an environmentally conscious pursuit of the American&nbsp;Dream. Yet the claim for high tech’s “clean”&nbsp;industrialization fell short as environmental concerns&nbsp;-- ranging from controlling growth to widespread&nbsp;chemical contamination of water supplies -- reshaped&nbsp;discussions about public and private space. Deep maps&nbsp;help explore the transformation of urban space over&nbsp;time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Along with addressing the role of spatial analysis in cutting edge humanities scholarship, each paper will&nbsp;outline which technologies they are using along with&nbsp;their possibilities and challenges. In particular, Robert&nbsp;Nelson will address a cutting edge spatial toolkit the&nbsp;University of Richmond Digital Scholarship Lab and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Statmen Design are developing for use across the digital humanities. The panelists will also discuss the&nbsp;role of collaboration, the process of developing crossinstitutional partnerships and designing for public&nbsp;audiences.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reckoning with Redlining: Public</span></h2><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Engagement with &quot;Mapping Inequality&quot;</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5">Robert Nelson</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In keeping with the conference theme of access and its emphasis upon public-facing scholarship, this&nbsp;presentation will reflect upon hundreds of comments&nbsp;and several conversations from the lay public about&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">&quot;Mapping Inequality&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> A collaboration of teams at four&nbsp;universities, &quot;Mapping Inequality&quot; currently includes&nbsp;nearly all of the more than 150 &quot;security maps&quot; and&nbsp;nearly 10,000 &quot;area descriptions&quot; created by the Home&nbsp;Owners' Loan Corporation during the Great&nbsp;Depression. These maps assessed mortgage risk for&nbsp;thousands of neighborhoods in U.S. cities large and&nbsp;small on a scale of &quot;A&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. &quot;A&quot; neighborhoods were&nbsp;deemed &quot;best,&quot; presenting minimal risks for banks and&nbsp;lenders; &quot;D&quot; neighborhoods were deemed &quot;hazardous&quot;&nbsp;for mortgage financing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">These grades were explicitly racialist and racist. HOLC's survey instruments asked local agents to&nbsp;quantify the &quot;infiltration of&quot; undesirable populations&nbsp;of African Americans and immigrants. To cite just a few&nbsp;examples, a small subsection of a Tacoma&nbsp;neighborhood was graded &quot;D&quot; though otherwise&nbsp;identical to the surrounding &quot;B&quot; neighborhood&nbsp;because &quot;Three highly respected Negro families own&nbsp;homes and live in the middle block of this area facing&nbsp;Verde Street. While very much above the average of&nbsp;their race, it is quite generally recognized by Realtors&nbsp;that their presence seriously detracts from the&nbsp;desirability of their immediate neighborhood.&quot;&nbsp;Proximity to black neighborhoods was enough to&nbsp;impact HOLC's risk assessment. A subsection of a&nbsp;neighborhood in Richmond was graded &quot;C&quot; rather&nbsp;than &quot;B&quot; because &quot;Respectable people but homes are&nbsp;too near negro area D2.&quot; In contrast, a Camden&nbsp;neighborhood kept an&quot;A&quot; grade despite bordering an&nbsp;African American neighborhood, but only because&nbsp;&quot;High walls separates this section from the colored&nbsp;area to the south&quot; that effectively prevented their&nbsp;&quot;spread.&quot;</span></p><img src="267_files/267-2.jpg" style="width:227pt;height:137pt;"/>
<p><span class="font4">These grades had real consequences. Through this HOLC program, the federal government reinforced&nbsp;redlining as a best practice within the real estate&nbsp;industry, in effect cutting off hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;African Americans off from equitable access to&nbsp;mortgage financing and thus homeownership, which&nbsp;arguably was the most significant mechanism of&nbsp;familial wealth accumulation in twentieth-century&nbsp;America. While of course it is by no means the only or&nbsp;even primary cause, this redlining program helped to&nbsp;contribute to generational wealth disparities between&nbsp;white and black Americans, where today the median&nbsp;wealth of white households is a shocking 13 times that&nbsp;of black households.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We designed &quot;Mapping Inequality&quot; not only with researchers but activists and the general public in&nbsp;mind. More than 150 of the HOLC maps have been&nbsp;georectified (nearly all of them, though we still have a&nbsp;few to add and undoubtedly a few more will surface),&nbsp;and polygons for each neighborhood added. The site is&nbsp;location aware and asks new users if they want to view&nbsp;their, or alternately the nearest, city. The opacity of the&nbsp;raster maps can be adjusted to help viewers connect&nbsp;the grades to the contemporary cityscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nearly all of the neighborhoods polygons can be clicked to read the area description survey. In short, we&nbsp;designed it hoping to encourage viewers to grapple&nbsp;with the materials related to their own localities and&nbsp;to prompt them to make connection to the present.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The introduction and other contextual materials on the site convey the authors' collective assessment that&nbsp;&quot;New Deal era housing policies ... helped set the course&nbsp;for contemporary America.&quot; We also include a&nbsp;visualization inspired by Ernest Burgess's concentric&nbsp;circle theory to suggest that HOLC policies definition&nbsp;of the interior of cities as &quot;slums&quot; functioned as a selffulfilling prophecy. Nevertheless, the site prioritizes&nbsp;access, exploration, and reuse of these important&nbsp;primary source materials. We do not provide these&nbsp;materials completely without commentary, but&nbsp;through our design choices we do facilitate and&nbsp;encourage relatively direct engagement with HOLC's&nbsp;maps and surveys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of these materials were available in the National Archives. While materials for many cities had been&nbsp;digitized, to date there has been no comprehensive&nbsp;collection let along one offering the functionality of&nbsp;&quot;Mapping Inequality.&quot; We have no doubt that these&nbsp;materials will be useful to researchers--not just&nbsp;historians but economists, urban planners, artists,&nbsp;medical doctors, etc.--and will facilitate a far more&nbsp;nuance understanding of HOLC and its consequences.&nbsp;We also have abundant evidence that these materials&nbsp;are a boon for activists working on fair housing and&nbsp;other social justice causes as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While we're excited about this, we intentionally developed the site as a public history project that&nbsp;aimed to spark conversations about wealth and racial&nbsp;inequality in American cities past and present. By that&nbsp;measure, the project so far has been a success. Two&nbsp;and a half weeks after being released, the map has&nbsp;received about 44,000 visits and been the subject of&nbsp;online coverage from NPR, National Geographic, Slate,&nbsp;CityLab, FastCo., Forbes, and Curbed, all of which have&nbsp;narrated the state's role in fostering redlining and&nbsp;wealth inequality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the comment section of these stories, in stories in local news sources, and in social media there has&nbsp;been a broad-ranging conversation about wealth and&nbsp;racial inequalities. On one of the spectrum, some&nbsp;respondents have been dismissive of the project,&nbsp;suggesting that this happened 80 years ago and is a&nbsp;remnant of the past that has little relevance today; one&nbsp;person notably characterizing the site as nothing more&nbsp;than &quot;historical racism porn.&quot; Others have responded&nbsp;to such comments that this is important inasmuch as&nbsp;many of these 80-year old maps resemble the racial&nbsp;and class landscapes of America today and that the&nbsp;government's role in reinforcing redlining and racial&nbsp;disparities of wealth isn't widely understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beyond these arguments about the impact of HOLC and relevance of redlining for understanding&nbsp;inequality in twenty-first-century cities, some of the&nbsp;most interesting and revealing comments have come&nbsp;from people for whom the maps have prompted&nbsp;reflection upon their own family histories. &quot;I grew up&nbsp;in Detroit in the late 50's and 60's,&quot; one man wrote.&nbsp;&quot;My address was 20400 Monte Vista, the corner Monte&nbsp;vista and Norfolk. Two streets east, starting at the&nbsp;corner of Birwood and 8 mile, was a wall. The wall was&nbsp;12-15 feet high, made of grey concrete blocks and ran&nbsp;behind the homes towards 7 mile, extending to an&nbsp;abandoned army base at the corner of Pembrook and&nbsp;Birwood. The wall was built to divide the&nbsp;neighborhoods, one side was all African Americans,&nbsp;The other all Caucasian. My mother lived on one side&nbsp;of the wall, it was all African American. She once (just&nbsp;once) told me that one could hear the White families&nbsp;on the other side of the wall talking, see them&nbsp;occasionally if a ball came over the fence and they&nbsp;asked for it, most times they did not. One had no&nbsp;contact, ever. The wall is still there, physically and&nbsp;emotionally.&quot; While so far this story is rather&nbsp;exceptional in its detail, it has prompted us to think&nbsp;about the possibility of using the site to solicit and&nbsp;collect stories about the consequences of redlining and&nbsp;segregation on particular individuals, families, and&nbsp;communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Given that &quot;Mapping Inequality&quot; has been at the center of several online conversations and hundreds of&nbsp;comments on websites two and a half weeks after it&nbsp;was first released, I'm optimistic that it will continue&nbsp;to occasion more conversations about the role of&nbsp;racism, redlining, and the state in inequalities of&nbsp;wealth in American cities. This presentation will&nbsp;provide an opportunity to critically reflect upon these&nbsp;materials and gauge the success and failures of this&nbsp;particular digital humanities project and perhaps the&nbsp;digital humanities more generally in informing socially&nbsp;and politically important public conversations. This&nbsp;presentation will also reflect upon the pros and cons of&nbsp;interpretive framing in digital humanities projects&nbsp;aimed at the public.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mapping the Federal Writers Project</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5">Lauren Tilton and Taylor Arnold</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">“Mapping the Federal Writers Project” will explore the role and implementation of deep mapping and&nbsp;spatial analysis in interpreting and understanding&nbsp;documentary expression in 1930s America. As&nbsp;Bodenhamer argues, deep maps are “visual, time-based genuinely multimedia and multilayered”&nbsp;(Bodenhemer, 11). These maps allow for nuanced&nbsp;spatial analysis in the service of new humanities&nbsp;questions and arguments. We will focus on the&nbsp;application of these concepts in a new extension of&nbsp;Photogrammar (photogrammar.yale.edu), a digital and&nbsp;public humanities project focused on print and visual&nbsp;culture in 1930s America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Photogrammar (photogrammar.yale.edu) uses methods from the digital humanities and digital&nbsp;resources to further contextualize and open new&nbsp;avenues of research into the federal project and&nbsp;documentary record of the era. In its current version,&nbsp;Photogrammar maps 170,000 photos from the Great&nbsp;Depression and World War II that comprise the United&nbsp;States Farm Security Administration and Office of War&nbsp;Information (FSA-OWI) photographic archive.&nbsp;Importantly, the collection includes some of the most&nbsp;prominent documentary photographers of the 20th&nbsp;century including Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans.&nbsp;Users can explore the collection through interactive&nbsp;maps through the use of spatial analysis; search by&nbsp;photo captions, photographer and time through text&nbsp;analysis; and browse by color and the faces depicted in&nbsp;the photographs through the use of image analysis.&nbsp;This new stage - funded by the American Council of&nbsp;Learned Societies- involves adding a new layer to&nbsp;Photogrammar - the Federal Writer’s Project (FWP),&nbsp;which funded writers to capture and describe the&nbsp;complexities of American life during the Great&nbsp;Depression (Couch, Hirsch, Mangione, Penkower,&nbsp;Stewart). Dozens of writers were sent to document&nbsp;through words the impact of the great depression on&nbsp;people's lives across the country. Prominent literary&nbsp;scholars such as Nelson Algren, known for The Man&nbsp;with the Golden Arm , and Ralph Ellison, known for&nbsp;Invisible Man. In the process, they asked people to&nbsp;provide their life histories pioneering the practice of&nbsp;oral history, a critical methodology in the field of&nbsp;history and in the humanities more broadly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Using deep mapping to expand our understanding of 1930s America, Photogrammar is creating links&nbsp;across archives in order to place the FSA-OWI in the&nbsp;larger federal effort to document America during the&nbsp;Great Depression. Merging collections from the&nbsp;University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill Libraries and&nbsp;the Library of Congress, the FWP includes over 4,000&nbsp;life histories. Interviews are being plotted on a new&nbsp;geographical layer allowing search by space and time.&nbsp;For example, a user will be able to follow an&nbsp;interviewer as they move across a state and the&nbsp;country to collect oral histories in the same way they&nbsp;can now follow documentary photographs like&nbsp;Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. Users will be able&nbsp;to search the new FWP layer independently or along&nbsp;with the geographical layer of FSA-OWI photographs&nbsp;and photographers. As a result, they will be able to&nbsp;compare the oral histories to the photographs taken in&nbsp;the same area allowing user to compare and contrast&nbsp;the documentary record created and funded by the&nbsp;federal government. As well, the new and cleaned&nbsp;transcripts created over this year are allowing for&nbsp;refined search functionality including faceted&nbsp;browsing and full text search. We are also&nbsp;experimenting with the role Natural Language&nbsp;Processing techniques such as Named-Entity&nbsp;Recognition to create new ways to browse the&nbsp;collection (Finkel and Manning 2005). In all, users will&nbsp;be able to explore the FWP and FSA-OWI spatially,&nbsp;temporally and through faceted searching allowing the&nbsp;public to explore the broader documentary record of&nbsp;the era relationally through deep mapping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second half of the paper will focus on methodology. We will start by discussing the potential&nbsp;benefits and potential difficulties of cross-institution&nbsp;collaboration in the cleaning and processing of data. In&nbsp;our experience, working with institutionally and&nbsp;spatially separated groups requires careful planning,&nbsp;but this extra up-front work improves both the general&nbsp;workflow and final products. We will touch on what&nbsp;scholarly and which technical questions guided our&nbsp;creation of a database schema for inputting metadata&nbsp;from the Federal Writer's Project. We take into&nbsp;consideration theoretical work regarding the creation&nbsp;of &quot;smart data&quot;, best practices regarding TEI markup&nbsp;(Schoch, TEI Initiative on Libraries), and principles for&nbsp;creating normalized database tables (Codd 1971). The&nbsp;discussion will culminate in showing how these&nbsp;carefully curated data sources are made interactive&nbsp;and public on our website. The geographic data are&nbsp;plotted using custom layers created in CARTO&nbsp;(formerly CartoDB), giving a great deal of interactivity&nbsp;out of the box. Specifically, we will extrapolate on how&nbsp;we designed the interactivity to enhance the other&nbsp;data collections on the Photogrammar website, to&nbsp;make new arguments and pose new questions about&nbsp;about documentary expression in 1930s America, to&nbsp;realize the principles of deep mapping and to engage&nbsp;with various publics.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mapping Silicon Valley</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5">Jason Heppler</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">“Mapping Silicon Valley” explores the role of spatial history in the urban environment of post-World War II&nbsp;Santa Clara Valley. Silicon Valley is the product of&nbsp;competing landscapes. The geographer D. W. Meinig&nbsp;refers to landscapes as “a naive acceptance of the&nbsp;intricate intermingling of physical, biological, and&nbsp;cultural features which any glance around us displays&quot;&nbsp;(Meinig, 1979). Wildlife refuges, fenced military&nbsp;installations, city and neighborhood districts, and&nbsp;polluted sites all hold definitions on the land. Historian&nbsp;Richard White has referred to this as &quot;hybrid&nbsp;landscapes,&quot; where cultural ideologies clash over&nbsp;conflicting uses of natural resources. The hybrid&nbsp;landscape is neither purely wild nor purely built, but&nbsp;instead a construction of natural and cultural systems&nbsp;that shape and create place (White, 2004). People&nbsp;define places by embedding ideas on the landscape. In&nbsp;cities, urban planners lay down grids of roads, zones,&nbsp;and regulations that divide cities along labor, leisure,&nbsp;and consumption, thus imbuing certain places with&nbsp;particular meaning. Landscapes, as Meinig notes, are&nbsp;“a great exhibit of consequences,&quot; and are “symbolic,&nbsp;as expressions of cultural values, social behavior, and&nbsp;individual actions worked upon particular localities&nbsp;over a span of time&quot; (Meinig, 1979).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By viewing Silicon Valley through the lens of landscapes and space, I argue for the importance of&nbsp;place in shaping a suburban vision of what urban&nbsp;historian Margaret O'Mara has called high-tech&nbsp;urbanism. Silicon Valley has come to represent the&nbsp;future of post-industrial economic development.&nbsp;Places as varied as Atlanta, Georgia; Philadelphia,&nbsp;Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska;&nbsp;Bangalore, India; Mission Hills in the Guandong&nbsp;Province of China; and Shenzhen, China, have looked&nbsp;to Silicon Valley as a model for economic and urban&nbsp;revitalization through high-tech economic&nbsp;development. Indeed, high tech is often drenched in&nbsp;green--from high-tech office campuses to &quot;smart&nbsp;cities&quot; that promise to transform work, leisure,&nbsp;transportation, and urban space into a more&nbsp;sustainable future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work of this high-tech landscape has been decades in the making and has come with high&nbsp;environmental costs, despite the promise of clean and&nbsp;green cities. Silicon Valley epitomized the trend of&nbsp;conflating a lack of smokestacks as a proxy for&nbsp;sustainable industrial development. High-tech&nbsp;landscapes centered around industrial research and&nbsp;scientific industry promised growth without pollution,&nbsp;but that promise was an impossible standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Mapping Silicon Valley&quot; is a broad discussion of three map-centric projects that have moved through&nbsp;different stages. The first set of maps were data driven&nbsp;thematic maps, produced largely during the course of&nbsp;my </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">dissertation research</span><span class="font4">. These maps were created&nbsp;largely out of a desire to understand the transforming&nbsp;landscape in Silicon Valley, from city growth and&nbsp;conflicts over urban space to the widespread presence&nbsp;of pollution and neighborhoods most threatened by&nbsp;toxic chemicals. The first section of this paper will&nbsp;reflect on the methodological underpinnings of these&nbsp;maps and their application to environmental&nbsp;humanities, while also discussing some of the&nbsp;potential shortcomings and enhancements that would&nbsp;make these maps more useful for historical research.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In December 1981, Fairchild Semiconductor identified a chemical leak in one of its solvents storage tanks in South San Jose. A nearby well operated by the Great Oakes Water Company was discovered contaminated&nbsp;and promptly shut down, but neighbors in the area had for years wondered about the miscarriages, birth&nbsp;defects, stillbirths, and other health issues affecting their families. When news of the chemical leak broke in&nbsp;January 1982, neighborhoods began to question just how clean the &quot;clean&quot; industries of high tech really were.&nbsp;Subsequent investigations by state, county, and city government and the Environmental Protection Agency&nbsp;discovered widespread chemical leaks throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, many of which became&nbsp;eligible for Superfund funding.

<p><span class="font4">The second mapping project is oriented around digital public history. Called Silicon Valley Historical&nbsp;(<a href="http://svhistorical.org">http://svhistorical.org</a>) and built on the Curatescape&nbsp;platform, the project seeks to collect archival material&nbsp;and narrate the importance of specific places to the&nbsp;Valley's history. Contributions to Silicon Valley&nbsp;Historical are not solely driven by scholarly&nbsp;contributions, but also rely on contributions by&nbsp;students and volunteers in close association with area&nbsp;universities, colleges, historical associations, and&nbsp;historical societies. The material contained in Silicon&nbsp;Valley Historical is meant, in part, to step away from&nbsp;the business-centric stories so often associated with&nbsp;Silicon Valley and consider more fully the urban spaces&nbsp;that were affected by the growth of this high-tech&nbsp;region. Still in its early stages of planning, this section&nbsp;will discuss the challenge of working with community&nbsp;partners and developing a sustainable and scalable&nbsp;digital history project that seeks to serve both the&nbsp;community it studies as well as students and scholars&nbsp;who will find the project useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final mapping project, still under planning and a partnership with the Stanford Spatial History&nbsp;Project, is tentatively titled From Orchards to Suburbs:&nbsp;Changing Landscapes in Silicon Valley and will&nbsp;represent the most technological and research heavy&nbsp;aspects of the project. As I investigate the politics&nbsp;surrounding the creation of place, this project will&nbsp;allow for the spatial exploration of zoning laws,&nbsp;general plans, government reports, and city council&nbsp;meeting minutes. The current design envisages the&nbsp;ability to navigate through a map and, depending on&nbsp;the viewport, presenting a list of primary sources&nbsp;available for reading about particular places in Silicon&nbsp;Valley. These will be accompanied by some&nbsp;computational and statistical tools for doing text&nbsp;analysis to uncover more about the kinds of&nbsp;conversations happening about particular places in&nbsp;the city and how they are being thought about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Collectively, &quot;Mapping Silicon Valley&quot; will critically reflect on these projects and their evolution as&nbsp;research and public history projects. The paper will&nbsp;further delve into the opportunities for deep mapping&nbsp;and interactivity for exploring the changing&nbsp;landscapes of Silicon Valley.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
