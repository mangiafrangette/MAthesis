<p><span class="font0">Gentrification takes many forms, ranging from whole scale bulldozing and forced relocations, to&nbsp;skyrocketing rents and dominion of multinational&nbsp;corporations over entire neighbourhoods. In Toronto,&nbsp;gentrification is facadist: the hollowed brick skins of&nbsp;Victorian storefronts are preserved in orderly rows,&nbsp;with great glass office buildings or condos sprouting&nbsp;up through their once-solid roofs and porticos. Luxury&nbsp;boutiques and art galleries take over the spaces once&nbsp;held by convenience stores and leave the original,&nbsp;rusting signage above the door, urging pedestrians to&nbsp;drink Coke. A local diner closes one night and reopens&nbsp;the next as a cocktail lounge - the interior and exterior&nbsp;remain untouched. The same 1960s banquets that&nbsp;once served $5 burgers to an impoverished and&nbsp;marginalized local population now serve burgers that&nbsp;cost $17, even though the name advertised on the&nbsp;now-vintage neon sign outside remains the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Most city dwellers are familiar with these external signs of gentrification. Gentrification, however, does&nbsp;not just shape the streetscape, it shapes the outlook of&nbsp;city dwellers in a way that obliterates urban history,&nbsp;especially the history of marginalized communities,&nbsp;even though it is these diverse populations of people&nbsp;of colour, immigrants, queers, and the working poor&nbsp;that gave cities the dynamic qualities that made them&nbsp;initially so attractive to new residents. In Toronto, the&nbsp;building boom of the last decade has left only the&nbsp;facade of much of the city’s diverse history. What is&nbsp;behind the facade - luxury condos and chain stores -represents a completely different model for a city, one&nbsp;that prioritizes neoliberalism, conservative values,&nbsp;and the homogenization of thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the traditional narrative of gentrification, gentrification begins with the influx of white gay and&nbsp;artistic communities, the so-called “creative class,”&nbsp;into economically disadvantaged areas. These “shock&nbsp;troops” of gentrification clear the way for yuppies with&nbsp;their preference for boutique coffee shops and organic&nbsp;vegetables. Rents rise and the original low-income or&nbsp;minority population of the neighbourhood is&nbsp;displaced, pushed further and further to the margins&nbsp;as the initial hot spot of gentrification rapidly expands.&nbsp;According to Sarah Schulman, Distinguished Professor&nbsp;of the Humanities at the College of Staten Island, this&nbsp;traditional narrative does not get to the heart of&nbsp;gentrification. The gay community has become a&nbsp;convenient straw man for an outcome that is shaped&nbsp;by much more powerful forces in municipal&nbsp;government, and the changing tenor of city life is due&nbsp;not to the introduction of artists spaces, but to the&nbsp;“gentrification of the mind” or the suburbanization of&nbsp;our understanding of city space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In her book, The Gentrification of the Mind, Schulman quotes the artist Penny Arcade’s piece “New&nbsp;York Values”: “There is a gentrification that happens to&nbsp;buildings and neighborhoods and there is a&nbsp;gentrification that happens to ideas.” Gentrification,&nbsp;according to Schulman’s theory, is caused not simply&nbsp;by the influx of new people, but when those people&nbsp;come to cities “not to join in or to learn and evolve, but&nbsp;to homogenize,” bringing “the values of the gated&nbsp;community and a willingness to trade freedom for&nbsp;security” (30). Gentrification “replaces most people’s&nbsp;experiences with the perceptions of the privileged and&nbsp;calls that reality” and as a result “gentrified happiness&nbsp;is often available to us in return for collusion with&nbsp;injustice” (161, 166).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the remaking of Toronto as a city of facades, are we not only erasing our history, but permanently&nbsp;altering the idea of what our city is, who it is for, and&nbsp;what purpose it serves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And is there a way the digital humanities scholars in particular can fight these forces to a halt? Drawing&nbsp;on Schulman’s argument and using the Lesbian and&nbsp;Gay Liberation in Canada project’s spatial model of the&nbsp;Toronto gay scene as a case study, the short paper&nbsp;proposed here will argue that the freely accessible&nbsp;publication of digital models of historical communities&nbsp;can be used to push back against the gentrification of&nbsp;the mind. The presentation that will accompany the&nbsp;paper will mark the launch of the Lesbian and Gay&nbsp;Liberation in Canada map, built from the 17,000+&nbsp;person, place, and event entity records in the LGLC&nbsp;database.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lesbian and Gay Liberation in Canada project reconfigures Donald McLeod’s remarkable two-volume work, Lesbian and Gay Liberation In Canada: A&nbsp;Selected Annotated Chronology, 1964-1981 as a TEI-encoded resource and graph database. The prototype&nbsp;database, available at <a href="http://lglc.ca">http://lglc.ca</a> consists of event,&nbsp;publication, person, and place records spanning from&nbsp;the founding of the first homophile associations in&nbsp;Canada through to the start of the AIDS crisis. The&nbsp;LGLC project extends McLeod’s codex form in order to&nbsp;data mine and represent queer history spatially and&nbsp;temporally. The project not only makes a much-neglected part of Canadian history available for&nbsp;mainstream scholarly use, it also provides a&nbsp;foundation for modeling identity and representing&nbsp;time and space in TEI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is much to model spatially and temporally. In the 1960s, the Toronto’s gay scene was located on&nbsp;Yonge Street and by the 1970s the bars had migrated&nbsp;north along Yonge from Queen Street towards&nbsp;Wellesley Street. Two of the most famous bars on this&nbsp;strip were the Parkside at 530 Yonge Street and the St.&nbsp;Charles Tavern at 488 Yonge Street, both owned by&nbsp;Norman Bolter. The neighbourhood surrounding the&nbsp;former sites of the Parkside and the St. Charles is&nbsp;currently a site of massive development. Gone are the&nbsp;seedy bars and massage parlours. Large glass condos&nbsp;are rising from bulldozed lots and from the tops of&nbsp;heritage buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The building that housed the St. Charles Tavern still stands above Yonge Street at Wellesley. It is slated to&nbsp;become a condo in 2017, the iconic clock tower that&nbsp;served for decades as a meeting spot for the gay&nbsp;community will be preserved at the base of a proposed&nbsp;153 metre glass spire. The incorporation of this piece&nbsp;of gay history into a shining skyscraper only furthers&nbsp;serves the ideology that scapegoats the gay&nbsp;community as the root cause of gentrification, making&nbsp;the million dollar condos imagined by a developer&nbsp;seem like an inevitability, rather than just one&nbsp;potential future amongst many. What is lost in this&nbsp;new instance of facadism is the history of the St.&nbsp;Charles Tavern, a violent history neither the city nor&nbsp;developers seem keen to acknowledge or&nbsp;commemorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For example, tracing the events outside the St. Charles Tavern on Halloween from 1968 to 1981&nbsp;reveals Toronto's violently homophobic history, and&nbsp;the inadequate policy and police response to that&nbsp;violence. In the 1960s it was illegal for men to wear&nbsp;clothing of the opposite sex in Toronto, a rule that was&nbsp;relaxed at Halloween. Every Halloween St. Charles&nbsp;Tavern hosted a drag show, and every year a&nbsp;homophobic mob congregated outside the bar to&nbsp;throw eggs and rotten vegetables as the queens&nbsp;arrived. In 1968, police found gasoline bombs behind&nbsp;the tavern, and yet in the following years police still&nbsp;permitted crowds to hurl insults shout slogans such as&nbsp;&quot;kill the queers&quot;, and throw debris at the patrons. It&nbsp;took a decade for the police to start arresting people in&nbsp;the mob; in the meantime a volunteer gay defense&nbsp;patrol, Operation Jack O'Lantern, escorted patrons&nbsp;through the neighbourhood and in through the back&nbsp;door of the tavern. Between 1975 and 1978, 14&nbsp;patrons of Toronto's gay bar scene were murdered.&nbsp;Eight of those murders went unsolved amid&nbsp;accusations of police homophobia, which were only&nbsp;exacerbated by homophobic articles published in the&nbsp;Toronto Police Association Journal. Publishing this&nbsp;history online, not only in text, but in map form, will&nbsp;make it accessible to an audience that will include not&nbsp;just scholars, but the citizens of Toronto. By&nbsp;developing accompanying pedagogical tools to guide&nbsp;users through the map, we hope to engage local&nbsp;residents, as well as the thousands of students at&nbsp;nearby universities and schools, in working to reclaim&nbsp;that lost history, and undoing some of the effects of the&nbsp;gentrification of the mind.</span></p>
