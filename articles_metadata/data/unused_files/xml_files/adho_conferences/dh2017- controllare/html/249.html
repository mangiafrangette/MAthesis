<p><span class="font1">In literary studies, we often make assumptions about how texts and cultural objects are received by&nbsp;readers and general audiences. But our evidence for&nbsp;these claims is typically anecdotal or based on&nbsp;extrapolations from a singular case-study: our own&nbsp;scholarly close readings. But can we assume that&nbsp;general readers interpret and make meaning from&nbsp;texts in the same way scholars do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To address the current state of the “reader” in literary studies, I collected all 1,410 articles published&nbsp;across a decade, 2004-2014, from three leading&nbsp;journals of literary theory and criticism: American&nbsp;Literary History (ALH), New Literary History (NLH),&nbsp;and The Proceedings of the Modern Language&nbsp;Association (PMLA). I then narrowed the collection&nbsp;down to articles primarily about literature (rather&nbsp;than drama, film, or theory, for instance), such that&nbsp;591 articles remained. This set was analyzed to&nbsp;discover how frequently the verb “read” was used, and&nbsp;what authors meant by each use of “read” (i.e. the&nbsp;literal act of reading or as a synonym for&nbsp;“interpretation”). I also asked how often authors&nbsp;referred to a “reader,” and determined in each&nbsp;instance if they were referring to an expert, academic&nbsp;reader or the general audience of a literary work. In&nbsp;short, with the seemingly omnipresent use of&nbsp;“reading” and “readers” in contemporary literary&nbsp;criticism, this study asks what kind of reading is&nbsp;actually being described, and who exactly are the&nbsp;communities of readers that literary critics invoke in&nbsp;published scholarship?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this talk, I share the results of this analysis. To suggest a new approach for making empirical claims&nbsp;about reader reception, I then introduce new methods&nbsp;for literary scholars interested in making claims about&nbsp;how readers and audiences respond to literary texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With methodology drawn from qualitative coding analysis, which is often employed in the social&nbsp;sciences, I hope to better understand how literary&nbsp;texts facilitate meaning for readers. I designed Reader&nbsp;Study (<a href="http://www.readerstudy.com">www.readerstudy.com</a>), an open-source and&nbsp;web-based research platform to track how recruited&nbsp;study participants read and respond to literary texts.&nbsp;The site guides study design and gathers reader data&nbsp;in the form of pre-surveys, post-surveys, and the&nbsp;highlights and annotations that readers create on&nbsp;texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a pilot study using Reader Study, I recruited 24 first-time readers (ages 18-35) of the post-9/11 novel&nbsp;Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. From their&nbsp;readings, I was able to gather, qualitatively code (using&nbsp;the software Dedoose), and analyze over 5,000&nbsp;annotations that participants created pertaining to the&nbsp;ways that the novel invokes 9/11 alongside the WWII&nbsp;bombings of Hiroshima and Dresden. By gathering&nbsp;demographic data like gender, age, and college major&nbsp;(along with post-reading survey and essay questions),&nbsp;I was able to isolate actual—rather than theoretical or&nbsp;imagined—interpretive communities and to see how&nbsp;their reactions to specific parts of the text contributed&nbsp;to their overall reception of the novel, particularly how&nbsp;they empathized with characters and engaged with&nbsp;the historical events mentioned in the plot. This talk&nbsp;shares the results of this case study, along with the&nbsp;specific methodology and variety of insights that can&nbsp;be yielded from this new, reader-informed approach&nbsp;to literary criticism. My talk concludes with an open&nbsp;invitation for scholars in literary studies and beyond&nbsp;to upload their own texts to Reader Study to gather&nbsp;similar reception data for their research.</span></p>
