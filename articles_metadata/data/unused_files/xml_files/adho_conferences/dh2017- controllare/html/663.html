<p><span class="font2">Vanderbilt University, United States of America</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">This half-day tutorial shows how XQuery integrates digital humanities data from multiple sources and formats. Drawing on the latest features of XQuery 3.1, the&nbsp;instructors demonstrate how to draw together information from the most common structured data formats, namely, JSON, CSV, RDF, and XML. We will teach&nbsp;some of the latest features of the XQuery language, including how to work with maps, arrays, and new functions like json-doc(), parse-json() and json-to-xml().</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Specifically, we will explore the following data</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">sources: (1) dictionary data (in JSON) from the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Oxford English Dictionary</span><span class="font2">; (2) an </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS)-based ebook catalog</span><span class="font2"> that makes&nbsp;publications at the U.S. Department of State searchable, browse-able and downloadable via OPDS-compli-ant ebook reader apps like Shubook, Hyphen, etc.; (3)&nbsp;an </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">OpenRefine reconciliation endpoint API</span><span class="font2"> built to let&nbsp;people run their own lists of people against biographical databases; and (4) interacting with IIIF APIs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Using a free and easy to install XQuery learning environment, participants (who must bring their own laptops) will gain hands-on experience writing queries&nbsp;against open datasets in CSV, JSON, and RDF and integrating this data with XML. Participants will gain exposure to the latest features of the XQuery language as&nbsp;well as best practices for connecting data across systems and formats. We presuppose that participants&nbsp;will have come with a basic understanding of XQuery.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Brief outline</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I. Requesting remote data and storing it into an&nbsp;XML database</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">II. Querying CSV with XQuery</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">III. Querying JSON with XQuery</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Querying RDF with XQuery</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enriching TEI with data from other sources and&nbsp;formats</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each section will include hands-on exercises.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Target audience</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Students, scholars, and practitioners who use or are interested in using digital methods in their humanities work in academic departments, libraries, &quot;alt-ac&quot;&nbsp;fields, or their private capacity; no previous programming experience required; some experience with XML&nbsp;or an XML-based format (TEI, EAD, MODS, METS,&nbsp;Atom) useful but not required. Participants will work&nbsp;with a common dataset provided by the tutorial leaders, but they may bring their own datasets for practice&nbsp;during the lab and consultation period.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tutorial leaders</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Clifford B. Anderson is Associate University Librarian for Research and Learning at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He has a M.Div. from Harvard&nbsp;Divinity School and a Th.M. and Ph.D. from Princeton&nbsp;Theological Seminary. He also holds a M.S. in Library&nbsp;and Information Science from the Pratt Institute in&nbsp;New York City. Cliff started working with XQuery in&nbsp;2006 before the first official version of the language&nbsp;was released. In 2014, he served as the project leader&nbsp;of the NEH-funded </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">XQuery Summer Institute</span><span class="font2"> at Vanderbilt University. He has also taught sessions on&nbsp;XQuery for iterations of Laura Mandel's </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Programming&nbsp;for Humanists</span><span class="font2"> course at Texas A&amp;M and leads the&nbsp;weekly </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">XQuery working group</span><span class="font2"> at Vanderbilt University for digital humanists</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Joseph C. Wicentowski is the Digital History Advisor in the Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University&nbsp;in modern East Asian history. He started using XQuery&nbsp;in 2007 to analyze and publish the Office of the Historian's </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">TEI-encoded publications and datasets</span><span class="font2">. For&nbsp;more on the project, see Wicentowski (2011). All code&nbsp;and data from the project are freely available on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">GitHub</span><span class="font2">. He recognized XQuery's potential to empower&nbsp;students, scholars, and practitioners to take control of&nbsp;their own data and build their own applications. But&nbsp;he knew that without resources geared toward people&nbsp;with a humanities background, others would struggle&nbsp;as he first did. He began writing about XQuery in various digital humanities forums, contributing to the&nbsp;XQuery Wikibook online textbook, and giving work-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">shops at the TEI@Oxford and Digital Humanities@Ox-ford Summer School programs. Joe regularly speaks and writes in the fields of history, documentary editing, and open government. He also actively participates in TEI, XQuery, and digital humanities communities, and fosters discussion about XQuery on Twitter at</span></p>
