<p><span class="font1">One of the agenda questions for the Internet Researchers Conference (IRC) 2017 scheduled to be&nbsp;held at IIIT, Bengaluru India is: “What research tools&nbsp;and infrastructures are needed to study, document,&nbsp;annotate, analyze, archive, cite, and work with (in&nbsp;general) digital objects, especially those in Indic&nbsp;languages?” However, before we get to this core</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">question in the research arena we need to confront the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">fundamental gap in the conversation- that there are as yet very few digital objects that are created, developed&nbsp;and preserved in Indian languages. Shodhganga, a&nbsp;digital repository for dissertations and theses from&nbsp;universities in India, is a national digitization project&nbsp;that has now grown substantially as a scholarly&nbsp;resource. Similarly, we have the National Digital&nbsp;Library, a project that plans to make curricular access&nbsp;electronic. However, both extraordinary projects are&nbsp;still limited to works that are primarily written in&nbsp;English. This is especially unfortunate in literature&nbsp;research. Literature departments across universities&nbsp;in India have a robust scholarship agenda and have&nbsp;some niche publications that focus on the works of&nbsp;literatures of the different languages as recognized in&nbsp;the 8<sup>th</sup> schedule of the constitution of India. What is&nbsp;missing is a bridge or a platform that enables a&nbsp;conversation between the scholarships in these&nbsp;languages. Certain university department structures-those lacking a department of Literature hospitable to&nbsp;comparatist conversations- have to take some&nbsp;responsibility for this lack of conversation. There are&nbsp;complicated economic and social factors beyond the&nbsp;scope of this discussion that are at play in this&nbsp;disproportionate representation of Indian literatures.&nbsp;It suffices to say, we need specific digital tools that&nbsp;recognize and fill this gap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the Open Access Scholarly Publishing project at IIT Indore, we have tried to identify and fulfil what we&nbsp;see as two scholarly imperatives: 1) a commitment to&nbsp;open access environment as crucial for research&nbsp;accessibility and 2) providing a platform for&nbsp;multilingual scholarly production with an emphasis on&nbsp;Indian languages. The Digital Humanities and&nbsp;Publishing Research Group at IIT Indore has a twopronged approach to what we see as a fundamental&nbsp;infrastructure problem: the absence of a polyphonic&nbsp;platform for a scholarly kitchen! The publishing&nbsp;project KSHIP was born from deliberation over these&nbsp;crucial issues challenging scholarship publishing in&nbsp;India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">KSHIP or Knowledge Sharing in Publishing recognizes this gap and advocates a philosophy of&nbsp;open access as crucial to a cooperative global&nbsp;knowledge production network. In its initial&nbsp;pilot/launch phase, KSHIP includes 1) a project of&nbsp;database development of scholarship and criticism in&nbsp;Indian languages. (we are starting with three&nbsp;languages, with the eventual goal of making KSHIP a&nbsp;crowd sourced platform with more languages to be&nbsp;added soon), and 2) we will be a consciously&nbsp;multilingual publishing house soliciting (and&nbsp;specifically targeting) scholarly monographs and&nbsp;translations in Indian languages, while also inviting&nbsp;scholars to host journals in multiple languages. In this&nbsp;session we would like to discuss some of the&nbsp;technological challenges of the project and possible&nbsp;solutions with an emphasis on collaborations across&nbsp;institutions and scholars in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The database development project addresses the first issue of dissemination and access to scholarship&nbsp;in regional language literatures in India. We have&nbsp;started a pilot with four languages with citation data&nbsp;from three different languages being uploaded. This&nbsp;will truly be a crowd sourced project in the future and&nbsp;we are in discussion with journals/publishers about&nbsp;uploading data to the platform. At least in the&nbsp;beginning, this platform will also be a part of KSHIP.&nbsp;We are looking for scholars from different languages to&nbsp;contribute to and be a part of this project. The project&nbsp;will be collaborative in the largest sense of the term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The project also includes a prototype of a translation plug-in tool. This is a crowd-sourcing&nbsp;translation tool developed as part of an UG project and&nbsp;directed by myself and my colleague from Computer&nbsp;Science, Dr Abhishek Srivastava. We hope to finesse&nbsp;the initial prototype of the tool over the coming&nbsp;months (and may even have a final prototype ready by&nbsp;the conference in Montreal!). The translation tool is&nbsp;designed to slice a scholarly paper/article so that one&nbsp;paper can potentially be translated by more than one&nbsp;person, and then moderated and collated at the&nbsp;publisher's end. There are several challenges posed by&nbsp;such a crowd sourced model. These include, among</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">others, issues of author/translator attribution, for which we are currently discussing and thrashing out&nbsp;different options. The interface will also offer the&nbsp;option of solicited translation, especially in the case of&nbsp;literature scholarship. We will experiment with the&nbsp;crowd-sourced translation using scientific and&nbsp;engineering essays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this short paper I will discuss: 1) The infrastructure gap in scholarly publishing in India, 2)&nbsp;the need for this to be addressed with a focus on&nbsp;multilingual publishing, and 3) the technological&nbsp;challenges specific to an ambitious long-term project.&nbsp;These questions will inevitably lead to discussions on&nbsp;digital preservation and the transforming and&nbsp;transformative role of technology in that process.</span></p>
