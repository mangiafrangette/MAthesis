<p><span class="font5">The analysis of color in movies is a topic of increasing interest in the still-young research field&nbsp;known as digital film analysis or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cinemetrics</span><span class="font5">. The&nbsp;thesis of Brodbeck (2011) is one of the early examples&nbsp;which have been discussed broadly. Brodbeck created&nbsp;a donut plot for each movie in which dominant colors&nbsp;of scenes are represented by colored slices within the&nbsp;plot. Similar approaches were taken by (Baker 2015)&nbsp;and (Burghardt, Kao, and Wolff 2016). Both&nbsp;approaches identify dominant colors of all frames in a&nbsp;movie and represent these colors as lines in a barcodelike visualization. In the first and the third project&nbsp;dominant colors are created by means of a clustering-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">algorithm, more precisely </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">k-means</span><span class="font5">. This algorithm is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">one of the most common approaches in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">color quantization</span><span class="font5"> and is also delivered for such tasks in&nbsp;well-known computer vision libraries like </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">OpenCV</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, there are several issues with using k-means for color quantization in digital film analysis which are rarely discussed within the community. One&nbsp;of the more obvious problems is that k-means (and&nbsp;other non-hierarchical cluster algorithms) require&nbsp;pre-definition of the number of clusters to be found.&nbsp;Thus, an automated analysis of around 180,000&nbsp;frames in a movie does not respect the fact that there&nbsp;are frames which are more complex in color than&nbsp;others. A more sophisticated procedure exists in&nbsp;which the k-means algorithm is used in a loop with&nbsp;different numbers of cluster. In this approach the best&nbsp;fitting number of clusters is defined and evaluated by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">silhouette coefficient</span><span class="font5"> which is applied to the result&nbsp;of each loop. However, Figure 1 demonstrates that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">best-fit in terms of clustering is definitely not the bestfit for the interpretation of colors in film analysis.</span></p><img src="095_files/095-1.jpg" style="width:237pt;height:118pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: Cluster analysis of dominant colors in a frame image of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Walking Dead.</span><span class="font0"> According to the silhouette&nbsp;coefficient the number of two clusters produces the best&nbsp;clustering result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Colors which seem to be important even before any interpretation has taken place disappear in the&nbsp;clustering process because they are 'eaten' by other&nbsp;clusters. Figure 2 offers a very impressive example for&nbsp;this phenomenon. The red girl from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Schindler's List</span><span class="font5"> -the most exciting thing that happens in the movie in&nbsp;terms of color- is not represented within the clusters&nbsp;transparently. The reason is that k-means has a&nbsp;tendency towards equally sized clusters and that the&nbsp;color difference is not big enough to survive this&nbsp;tendency.</span></p><img src="095_files/095-2.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:159pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2: Cluster analysis of color in a scene from 'Schindler's List'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another problem is that k-means produces slightly different results each time it runs. Hence, sometimes a&nbsp;color which would be perceived as different by&nbsp;humans is present in the result and sometimes it is not.&nbsp;The results differ most in between three and five&nbsp;clusters as predefined cluster values. However, this is&nbsp;exactly the span which is most often used for color&nbsp;quantization in digital film analysis. Finally, the k-means algorithm produces different results in&nbsp;correspondence with the color space in which a frame&nbsp;is represented. For instance, the HSV color space&nbsp;produces better results than the RGB color space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of these problems call for a theoretical evaluation of what dominance means for dominant&nbsp;colors in digital film analysis. Unfortunately, the&nbsp;previously mentioned projects have not presented&nbsp;such evaluations. Furthermore, these projects also did&nbsp;not systematically interpret the results they have&nbsp;produced. For this reason, it is not transparent which&nbsp;semantics can be found in the patterns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this being said, a different approach for the computational analysis of colors in movies seems&nbsp;necessary. This approach needs to introduce a starting&nbsp;point which is technologically less arguable and which&nbsp;offers concepts for the interpretation of results. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">approach that will be presented builds upon the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">theory of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seven color-contrasts</span><span class="font5"> developed by Johannes Itten (Itten 1961, 36-109). Itten claims that the effect&nbsp;of colors is not absolute but depends on the&nbsp;surrounding color environment. Colors interact with&nbsp;each other and there are seven contrasts in which this&nbsp;interaction can be analyzed. These contrasts are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">hue</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">saturation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">light-dark</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">cold-warm</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">complementary</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">simultaneous</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">extension</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each contrast has certain capabilities to structure and create effects in the narrative and aesthetic design of a&nbsp;movie. They can be used: to guide the attention of&nbsp;viewers, to create spatial ambiance, to create&nbsp;orientation or confusion, to support the symbolic layer&nbsp;or to create associations as well as emotions. Although&nbsp;these effects are not generalizable the approach of&nbsp;color-contrasts has more to provide to interpret color&nbsp;in movies than the analysis of single colors. This holds&nbsp;true especially where the dynamics of multiple&nbsp;contrasts are related with each other and begin to&nbsp;form a language of color. For instance, a movie might&nbsp;have a stable opposition between cold and warm&nbsp;colors but more progressive color dynamics (Wulff&nbsp;1988) between light and dark colors. The results of&nbsp;such an analysis can be related to narrative aspects,&nbsp;characters, leitmotifs or the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mise en Scène</span><span class="font5"> in a movie&nbsp;or a corpus of movies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The technological implementation of this approach depends on the type of contrast that will be analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Data for the first three contrasts can be obtained by converting movie frames to the HSV or HSB color&nbsp;space. The conversion between the YUV color space (in&nbsp;which many movie files are represented) into HSV is&nbsp;lossless in most cases (Ford and Roberts 1998). Each&nbsp;channel in HSV represents one such contrast. Usage of&nbsp;the CIE L*a*b* color space can be considered to&nbsp;comply with certain issues of color awareness that are&nbsp;not tackled by HSV and others. Other contrasts require&nbsp;further processing. For instance, to obtain cold and&nbsp;warm color values, each value in the hue channel can&nbsp;be associated with a value that represents how warm&nbsp;or cold it is. In general, values of red and yellow are&nbsp;conceived as warm. However, this effect is very much&nbsp;influenced by cultural and psychological aspects&nbsp;(Küppers 2000). Therefore, the association of color&nbsp;values with values of warmth is a task that requires&nbsp;decision-making. In contrast, the presence of&nbsp;complementary and simultaneous colors is a&nbsp;mathematical relationship and can be computed&nbsp;within a certain color space consistently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are also several ways in which contrast data can be analyzed. Figures 3 and 4 visualize two of such&nbsp;strategies. In both cases a histogram of one contrast&nbsp;was computed for every second of the movie. In Figure&nbsp;3 the leftmost and rightmost peaks in each histogram&nbsp;was calculated. These peaks constitute the min- and&nbsp;max-bound of the contrast span in each frame. The x-axis represents the time-axis of the movie while the y-axis shows the value of each min- and max-bound.</span></p><img src="095_files/095-3.jpg" style="width:250pt;height:44pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 3: Slightly interpolated boundaries of light-dark contrast in '28 Days Later'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Figure 4 the contrast of a spectrum was reduced to 16 bins and each contrast value that was produced by&nbsp;a critical number of pixels was plotted as a point. The&nbsp;size of the point represents the number of pixels in a&nbsp;frame for each bin.</span></p><img src="095_files/095-4.jpg" style="width:243pt;height:32pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 4: The appearance of hue values above a certain threshold in '28 Days Later'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The movie which underlies both visualizations is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">28 Days Later</span><span class="font5">. Figure 3 represents the light-dark-contrast. It shows two sequences in which light and&nbsp;dark colors go up simultaneously for a certain amount</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of time. One sequence is between the 200th and the 800th frame the other between the 6000th and the&nbsp;beginning of the credits. In the first sequence the&nbsp;protagonist Jim awakes from coma and realizes that&nbsp;the world fell apart. In the second sequence the main&nbsp;group of persons reach the final save place. Thus, a&nbsp;similar pattern in one contrast frames the actual&nbsp;storyline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color-itself-contrast</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">represented in Figure 4 is extremely different in these scenes. The first scene has a narrow spectrum while&nbsp;the spectrum of the second scene is broad. The narrow&nbsp;spectrum provokes disorientation because it tones&nbsp;down differences. The color segment is literally&nbsp;dazzling. In contrast, the spectrum and coverage of&nbsp;colors at the end mediate clarity, stability and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This presentation will outline the problems of k-means for color quantification in digital film analysis. It will describe the theory of seven color-contrasts and&nbsp;give examples how such theory can be adopted&nbsp;computationally. Each step will be illustrated by an&nbsp;analysis of a corpus of three neo-zombie-movies, more&nbsp;precisely </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">28 Days Later</span><span class="font5">, '[REC]' </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and World War Z</span><span class="font5">.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
