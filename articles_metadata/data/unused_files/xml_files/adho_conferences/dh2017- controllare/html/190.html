<p><span class="font0">In her 2011 article, “</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">All the Digital Humanists are White, All the Nerds are Men, but Some of Us Are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">Brave</span><span class="font0">,” Moya Z. Bailey unearths a radical, unrealized potential in the Digital Humanities that few have made&nbsp;explicit since its articulation: a practice of the digital&nbsp;humanities that is also a practice of critical university&nbsp;studies. I cite Bailey here in full:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In blog posts, </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">Miriam Posner</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bethany</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">Nowviskie</span><span class="font0"> have both addressed the structures that impede women from connecting to digital&nbsp;humanities. The increase of women in higher&nbsp;level positions within universities have led to&nbsp;changes in the infrastructure, with child care&nbsp;and nursing nests cropping up on campuses&nbsp;across the country. Similarly, people of color&nbsp;have been engaging in </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">critical university studies</span><span class="font0"> long before the 1990s when the field is said&nbsp;to have emerged. By demanding space as students and faculty, in addition to advocating for&nbsp;rights as the laborers that built and maintain&nbsp;these institutions, people of color have organized through concerted effort to bring about&nbsp;changes in institutional culture and structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The question of diversity and inclusion that informs this intervention is intimately linked to institutional austerity and the precaritization of intellectual labor. Post-2008, the economic pillaging of the university is undeniable. It is also undeniable that the digital&nbsp;humanities emerged as a contemporary force for disciplinary transformation during this precise economic&nbsp;shift. Matthew K. Gold states this matter of factly in his&nbsp;introduction to the 2012 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Debates in the Digital Humanities</span><span class="font0"> anthology, “</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">The Digital Humanities Moment</span><span class="font0">”: “At&nbsp;a time when many academic institutions are facing&nbsp;austerity budgets, department closings, and staffing&nbsp;shortages, the digital humanities experienced a banner year that saw cluster hires at multiple universities,&nbsp;the establishment of new digital humanities centers&nbsp;and initiatives across the globe, and multimillion-dollar grants distributed by federal agencies and charitable foundations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The university's loss coextensive with DH's boon requires further interrogation. This paper builds on&nbsp;Bailey and Gold's work by directly linking concerns in&nbsp;DH for diversity and inclusion to economic disparities&nbsp;in the university via critical university studies. I do so&nbsp;not to condemn DH for its rise, but to continue to unearth its radical potential. While the literature in critical university studies is broad, I connect DH to two&nbsp;critical university approaches in particular: decolonial&nbsp;feminism and Autonomist Marxism. Both approaches&nbsp;augment current debates in DH as they forefront questions of inclusion, diversity, and economic variance,&nbsp;but also provide more pointedly political approaches&nbsp;to pedagogy and tool-use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In her 2003 book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Feminism Without Borders</span><span class="font0">, Chandra Talapade Mohanty claims that “the moment we tie university-based research to economic development-and describe this research as fundamentally drive by&nbsp;market forces-it becomes possible to locate the university as an important player in capitalist rule” (173).&nbsp;This claim is couched in a decolonial method committed to developing “the urgent political necessity of&nbsp;forming strategic coalitions across class, race, and national boundaries,” but it is also motivated by a commitment to feminist struggle (9). The university is a&nbsp;site of decolonial feminist struggle in particular because it is a “contradictory place where knowledges&nbsp;are colonized but also contested [...] It is one of the few&nbsp;remaining spaces in a rapidly privatized world that offers some semblance of a public arena for dialogue, engagement, and visioning of democracy and justice”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(170) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. What follows is therefore a simple claim, but&nbsp;one that is difficult to reconcile in a contemporary context, especially as it might apply to DH: “Feminist literacy necessitates learning to see (and theorize) differ-ently-to identify and challenge the politics of&nbsp;knowledge that naturalizes global capitalism and busi-ness-as-usual in North American higher education”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(171) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It does not take a careful reader to detect a radical undercurrent to Mohanty's interest in feminist literacy, nor should it be a surprise that those disproportionately affected by institutional inequity might rely&nbsp;on a radical political logic with which to situate their&nbsp;intellectual labor. Perhaps the strongest emergent DH&nbsp;interest in which Mohanty's work carries the most&nbsp;methodological weight, however, is found in Roopika</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Risam’s essay, “</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">Navigating the Global Digital Humanities: Insights from Black Feminism</span><span class="font0">.” There, Risam argues that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the field of digital humanities has grown in size and scope, the question of how to navigate a scholarly community that is diverse in geography, language, and participant demographics has become pressing. An increasing&nbsp;number of initiatives have sought to address&nbsp;these concerns, both in scholarship-as in work&nbsp;on postcolonial digital humanities or #trans-formDH-and through new organizational structures like the ALliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) Multi-Lingualism and&nbsp;Multi-Culturalism Committee and Global Out-look::Digital Humanities (GO::DH), a special interest group of ADHO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We see similar issues at work in #transformDH and feministDH more broadly. However, Alan Liu’s recent&nbsp;claim to a </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">critical infrastructure studies</span><span class="font0"> augments&nbsp;these concerns. Liu summarizes his interest in critical&nbsp;infrastructure studies as a “call for digital humanities&nbsp;research and development informed by, and able to influence, the way scholarship, teaching, administration,&nbsp;support services, labor practices, and even development and investment strategies in higher education intersect with society.” The rhetorical shift from “critical&nbsp;university” to “critical infrastructure” is interesting&nbsp;here. Where Liu goes so far to say that most, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">if not the&nbsp;whole of our lives</span><span class="font0">, are organized through institutional&nbsp;mechanisms formative of a “social-cum-technological&nbsp;milieu,” “the word ‘infrastructure’ give[s] us the same&nbsp;kind of general purchase on social complexity that Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams, and others sought when&nbsp;they reached for their all-purpose word, ‘culture.’”&nbsp;Paired with Risam’s work above, Liu draws us to closer&nbsp;to a critique that would mirror Mohanty’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the same time, Mohanty’s decolonial approach dialogues with Autonomist Marxist approaches to the&nbsp;same problem. Writing of their work with CAFA (Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa), George&nbsp;Caffentzis and Silvia Federici comment on institutional&nbsp;formations like those that Mohanty invokes, but also&nbsp;those that are already operative in DH: global initiatives organized around a common goal. Where&nbsp;Caffentzis and Federici depart from the question of DH&nbsp;infrastructure is certainly a question of technological&nbsp;focus, but also it is also a political one. “As was the factory,” Caffentzis and Federici write, “so now is the university” (125). The import of this claim comments on&nbsp;our institutional alliances, as well as our collective understanding of what educational institutions are for.&nbsp;Thinkers of critical university studies define the university this way because it maximizes the forms of solidarity that are available to us in the face of sovereign&nbsp;institutional control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For both DH and the Autonomist approach, solidarity is most prominently featured in tool-use and production. Following Caffentzis and Federici, Gigi Roggero mobilizes critical university studies toward a&nbsp;reinvention of the tool. In his article, “Notes on Framing and Reinventing Co-research,” he argues that&nbsp;“tools of inquiry have to be reinvented at the level of&nbsp;the general intellect’s networks, going beyond the division between the virtual and the real,” in order to&nbsp;maximize living labor’s break with capital, opening up&nbsp;a space for co-research to form a “material base for&nbsp;revolution” (520-521). DH’s reinvention of the library,&nbsp;the archive, and the application of technology to humanistic inquiry more generally have never been&nbsp;more apt. At the same time, a strong dialogue with Liu&nbsp;and Risam’s work, stemming from Bailey’s claim to DH&nbsp;as critical university studies, is brought to the fore in&nbsp;Roggero’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This paper concludes by theorizing what forms of alliance/solidarity might be drawn between DH’s&nbsp;transformative work at the level of infrastructure with&nbsp;critical university studies’ political work at the level of&nbsp;the institution. I argue that the university is not a freestanding institution; it is embedded within processes&nbsp;of real subsumption that span the whole of contemporary life. Concerns for diversity and inclusion are contoured by this fact, and the transformative power of&nbsp;tool-use extant in DH praxis resist it.</span></p>
