<p><span class="font1">Like the phrase “digital humanities,” “public humanities” has proven difficult to pin down, even by practitioners who have come to value this term as an&nbsp;accurate description of their research interests and institutional affiliations. It has been a term used (primarily, but not exclusively, by institutions of higher education in North America and by grant-funding agencies&nbsp;like the National Endowment for the Humanities) to&nbsp;describe various forms of cultural production: physical and digital acts of curation, archival initiatives,&nbsp;community outreach, educational programming, and&nbsp;public arts initiatives. It has ties to terms like “public&nbsp;history.” More recently, investments in “public humanities” have more frequently intersected (and at times&nbsp;elided) investments in “digital humanities,” given the&nbsp;public-facing imperatives of many digital projects and&nbsp;practitioners. Are all digital humanities projects also&nbsp;inevitably public humanities initiatives? When the&nbsp;phrase “public humanities” is invoked, who is most often speaking, and to what do they refer? Who is most&nbsp;likely to fund projects with explicit ties to this term,&nbsp;and what communities are served and financed by&nbsp;these efforts? When practitioners of public humanities&nbsp;write about the value of their work, who do they cite?&nbsp;More generally, what forms, contexts, people, places,&nbsp;geographic regions, occupations, and communities is&nbsp;the term “public humanities” tied to, and who is missing, obscured, erased, or otherwise apart from these&nbsp;conversations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This poster will document recent efforts by public humanities practitioners at the John Nicholas Brown</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage (Brown University) to survey and reflect upon both&nbsp;the ten-year history of the Center (and its M.A. program in Public Humanities) and, more generally, the&nbsp;state of “public humanities” as a field of critical inquiry. Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students&nbsp;at the Center have determined that the institutional&nbsp;memory of the Center would benefit greatly from an&nbsp;indexed archive of primary materials (syllabi, photographs, exhibition materials, student projects and&nbsp;writings, among others) as well as a collection of oral&nbsp;histories from major figures in its history (directors,&nbsp;staff, faculty, graduates, community fellows and collaborators), and we are in the process of building this&nbsp;collection in collaboration with representatives of&nbsp;Brown's Center for Digital Scholarship and the Brown&nbsp;Library's digital repository service. We have also begun assembling a database of texts (books, journal articles, grant application guidelines, blog posts, and the&nbsp;language of Center / program recruitment literature,&nbsp;among others) to better understand where and why&nbsp;the phrase “public humanities” has been utilized between the late twentieth century (starting around&nbsp;1970, in Congressional documents that informed the&nbsp;creation of the NEH) and the early twenty-first century. The poster will contextualize the motivations behind our decisions to focus on particular corpora and&nbsp;the organization of our database.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beyond the first iteration of this hyperlocal history (which will materialize in the form of the first stage of&nbsp;the Center's collection in Brown's digital repository&nbsp;and will be publicly available to researchers), we will&nbsp;concurrently release a dataset of public humanities&nbsp;corpora and a series of visualizations exploring that&nbsp;data. One will begin to map the geographic regions and&nbsp;institutional ties to public humanities programs and&nbsp;grant-funded public humanities initiatives. Another&nbsp;will document part of the citational history of public&nbsp;humanities discourse by visualizing links between&nbsp;texts present in bibliographic data of a sample set of&nbsp;academic texts. Representative samples of these visualizations, which are not meant to be comprehensive&nbsp;so much as they are intended to be models for potential avenues of inquiry, as well as the methodologies&nbsp;informing them, will be featured in the poster. We will&nbsp;also link these datasets to the crowdsourced data we&nbsp;receive from “Day of Public Humanities” (#DayofPH),&nbsp;a digital project held in May of 2017 that, like the “Day&nbsp;of Digital Humanities” initiative, aims to make the various forms of day-to-day labor (and laborers) in the&nbsp;field visible and to encourage dialogue across and beyond these contexts.</span></p>
