<p><span class="font2">India is a multilingual country which has twenty-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">two official languages and eleven written scripts, according to the 8<sup>th</sup> schedule to the Constitution of India. Each language has its own literature and scholarship.&nbsp;In the digital space, both the dissemination of and access to scholarly articles of Indian languages and literatures are difficult and rare. The main objective of this&nbsp;project is to offer scholarly publications and access to&nbsp;scholarly articles in languages other than English.&nbsp;There are some scholarly articles available in print,&nbsp;but most of them give citation of the works that is insufficient for research scholars. There are some databases available for scholarship in India such as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Shodhganga: a reservoir of Indian Theses</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">National&nbsp;Digital Library</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">. Shodhganga</span><span class="font2"> offers the scholarly communities to access ETD (Electronic Thesis and Dissertation) in English. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">National Digital Library</span><span class="font2"> is a digital&nbsp;repository which provides learning resources for various subjects with single-window search of which the&nbsp;interface is available in three languages English, Hindi&nbsp;and Bangla. Similarly, there are some databases for&nbsp;digitized literary manuscripts of Indian languages: for&nbsp;instance, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Project Madurai</span><span class="font2"> for the Tamil language, etc.&nbsp;However, there is no comprehensive digital database&nbsp;for scholarship in Indian languages and literatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This database project envisages digital ecology as an integral part of knowledge production and dissemination. In India, Digital Humanities in literature, apart&nbsp;from notable exceptions like “</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bichitra</span><span class="font2">”, there is little&nbsp;in terms of digitization of scholarship from many language literatures. Our database will serve as a collaborative and comprehensive hub for Indian literature&nbsp;scholarship. We plan to make this database after its initial launch to be crowd sourced by enabling Indian literature departments across universities to use it as a&nbsp;platform for disseminating their scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poster presents the initial stage of aggregating metadata of literature and scholarly articles in different languages. We have already collected data for Mal-ayalam, North-East, Sindhi and collecting data for Bengali, Hindi and Tamil is underway. This will be extended to other Indian languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The collection of data is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Malayalam-25800</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">North-East-1494</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Sindhi- 8813</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We will use the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">MLA International Bibliography</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shodhganga</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">National Digital Library</span><span class="font2"> as models for&nbsp;our project to develop a database of literature and&nbsp;scholarly articles in Indian languages. One of the primary objectives of the project is to offer the works&nbsp;through an open-access platform which allows access&nbsp;to the researchers across the country. Hence, it will be&nbsp;made open-access through KSHIP (Knowledge Sharing&nbsp;In Publication) which is a multilingual academic publishing project at IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)&nbsp;Indore, India. The database will be developed in different Indian languages, which presents an opportunity&nbsp;to researchers to explore the database in their own respective languages. Collecting data for the database&nbsp;has already been initiated, and the next stage of the&nbsp;project is to host it. The poster presents an introduction to the project, the need for a multilingual scholarly&nbsp;database, the primary objective of the project, different Indian scripts, and our methodology, collected&nbsp;data, and model for access (open access).</span></p>
