<p><span class="font3">Humanities scholarship is becoming increasingly collaborative, participatory, and public facing. As&nbsp;humanists take up digital tools to conduct and share&nbsp;research, larger teams are needed to complete ever&nbsp;more complex computational tasks. When blending&nbsp;these heterogeneous teams--which may include&nbsp;faculty, librarians, staff, undergraduates, graduate&nbsp;students, postdocs, and community contributors--humanists have an ethical responsibility to offer a fair&nbsp;and transparent accounting of research activities.&nbsp;Tracing the evolution of research contributions is&nbsp;necessary for a range of issues facing digital&nbsp;scholarship such as authorship allocation, promotion&nbsp;and tenure, and reports to funders. The allocation of&nbsp;credit and authorship is an increasingly thorny issue&nbsp;for teams with a range of possible roles and a variety&nbsp;of research outputs and media types. There is,&nbsp;however, a large amount of data being generated by&nbsp;these teams that is capable of describing and&nbsp;measuring the contributions made on a variety of&nbsp;platforms and by multiple team member and&nbsp;community partners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite our inheritance of social and collaborative tools, many of these systems elide the nuance and&nbsp;process of humanities based research. Knowledge&nbsp;creation is not merely a function of how much code is&nbsp;produced. New knowledge is often the result of a key&nbsp;insight made by a team of students, staff, and faculty.&nbsp;These insights are generated in a complex and&nbsp;overlapping system of mentorship, service, teaching,&nbsp;learning, and authorship that are deeply dependent,&nbsp;social, and human. With a system that is possible of&nbsp;visualizing the history of a digital project over the&nbsp;course of years, which may see the ranks of team&nbsp;members change over time, primary investigators and&nbsp;project funders will be better able to address often&nbsp;thorny and ethically charged issues relating to student&nbsp;assessment, mentorship, authorship, promotion, and&nbsp;tenure. Credit, promotion, funding, and credentialing&nbsp;are more complex topics than ever, yet many&nbsp;individuals and institutions rely on simple, outdated&nbsp;structures to assess the value of insights made by&nbsp;networked teams.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Social Knowledge Creation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Penn State Digital Humanities Lab (Penn State Behrend) in partnership with the Teaching and&nbsp;Learning with Technology group (Penn State&nbsp;University Park) has developed a prototype of an&nbsp;ongoing project entitled the Social Knowledge&nbsp;Timeline (sktimeline.net). By linking together popular&nbsp;collaboration tools, the SKTimeline stores, analyzes,&nbsp;and communicates user data in three distinct areas of&nbsp;social knowledge creation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Collaboration Platforms: </span><span class="font3">Many scholars&nbsp;are turning to collaboration platforms like&nbsp;Slack, Yammer, and Basecamp to organize&nbsp;teams and foster communication within&nbsp;teams. These systems use an interface&nbsp;similar to a social media feed to pool project&nbsp;member input into a single narrative and&nbsp;eliminate the need for email. These systems&nbsp;help share documents and support&nbsp;conversations that may lead to drafting&nbsp;manuscripts on Google Drive and other&nbsp;services. These platforms offer a rich,&nbsp;conversational natural language data set that&nbsp;describes how team members mentor and&nbsp;support each other over time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Version Control Systems: </span><span class="font3">Github and&nbsp;Bitbucket are two of the most common&nbsp;version control platforms. These tools help&nbsp;facilitate large programming and encoding&nbsp;projects by allowing multiple coders to work&nbsp;simultaneously. When a team member&nbsp;“commits” code, a commit message&nbsp;describes the nature of the contribution as&nbsp;well as the date and time. This message will&nbsp;offer a highly granular view of coding&nbsp;projects as they unfold. Similarly, by&nbsp;including a feed from Google Drive’s own&nbsp;version control system, document&nbsp;authorship may be traced with similar&nbsp;precision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Social Media: </span><span class="font3">Platforms like Twitter,&nbsp;LinkedIn, and Facebook have proven to be&nbsp;fast paced and engaging areas for social and&nbsp;cultural exchange. Twitter has long been a&nbsp;particularly important site for digital&nbsp;humanists. The SKTimeline draws together&nbsp;multiple hashtags and user handles to frame&nbsp;preserve and contextualize this often&nbsp;ephemeral site of both popular and scholarly&nbsp;debate. Hashtags associated with digital&nbsp;projects, conferences, publications, and even&nbsp;course work can be analyzed and set in real&nbsp;time with other platforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Credit allocation in large teams is dependent on our ability to describe, quantify, and visualize our&nbsp;activities. By analyzing the rich natural language&nbsp;conversations generated by teams, the SKTimeline&nbsp;solves these ethical and institutional problems. The&nbsp;appearance of “Collaborators’ Bill of Rights” for&nbsp;digital humanities projects in 2011 is symptom of a&nbsp;need for greater clarity in heterogeneous&nbsp;collaborative teams (Clement et al 2011). The&nbsp;Modern Language Association’s “Guidelines for&nbsp;Evaluating Work in Digital Humanities and Digital&nbsp;Media” are similarly responding to appropriate&nbsp;credit allocation for researchers. There is a need for&nbsp;a more formalized and automated system of data&nbsp;collection and analysis for collaborative&nbsp;researchers across the university.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Machine Learning Contributor Taxonomies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) is used to quantify and&nbsp;describe user contributions. Machine learning systems&nbsp;like Google’s Cloud Platform is used to conduct&nbsp;language analysis, and translation, image recognition,&nbsp;sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. Custom&nbsp;machine learning systems has also been layered on to&nbsp;these services using the Tensor Flow library to learn&nbsp;the project specific phrasing for contributions.&nbsp;Additional text analysis will be conducted using&nbsp;standard tools like the Natural Language Toolkit&nbsp;(NLTK) to link to TaDiRAH’s defined contributions.&nbsp;This project will reshape authorship and credit&nbsp;allocation in the humanities and beyond, but it will&nbsp;also be a perfect test bed for an emerging set of&nbsp;artificial intelligence tools that are now finding&nbsp;common application throughout society. In this way,&nbsp;the SKTimeline is representative of a broader cultural&nbsp;trend toward AI systems in aiding research.</span></p><img src="120_files/120-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:137pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3">Undergraduate course projects, ongoing faculty research with graduate researchers, digital humanities&nbsp;labs, and library based digital research projects are&nbsp;just some of the contexts this round of user testing will&nbsp;examine. The data collected on participating teams&nbsp;against interview and form based user surveys. This&nbsp;kind of socially oriented knowledge creation emerges&nbsp;from a community of practice that moves fluidly&nbsp;between curricular experiences and co-curricular&nbsp;research experiences often hosted in DH labs, libraries,&nbsp;and centers. The SKTimeline seeks to solve a critical&nbsp;problem within scholarly communication in a digital&nbsp;context. The SKTimeline offers a means to capture&nbsp;complex narratives that constitute the organic and&nbsp;nuanced unfolding of humanities research.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
