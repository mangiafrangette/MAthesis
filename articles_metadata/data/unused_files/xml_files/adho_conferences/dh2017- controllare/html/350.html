<p><span class="font11">Academia Sinica, Taiwan</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">In the late evening of March 18, 2014, students and activists stormed into and occupied the main&nbsp;chamber of Taiwan's Legislature. The event set off the&nbsp;Sunflower Movement, signifying a turning point in&nbsp;Taiwan's history. Researchers at Academia Sinica&nbsp;arranged to acquire all the supporting artifacts and&nbsp;documentary materials in the chamber before the&nbsp;protest came to a peaceful end. In this paper, we&nbsp;discuss the issues in archiving and making available&nbsp;to the public a large collection of artifacts created by&nbsp;thousands of participants in a contemporary event.&nbsp;We demonstrate systems designed to encourage&nbsp;people to identify items of their own in the archive.&nbsp;We show how an accessible catalog to the archive can&nbsp;help people tell their stories hence collectively may&nbsp;strengthen the public's recollections about the&nbsp;movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the late evening of March 18, 2014, a small group of students and young activists stormed into the main&nbsp;chamber of the Taiwan's Legislature in protest of the&nbsp;hastily reviewed and pending signature of the CrossStrait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) with China&nbsp;(Figure 1). The occupation of the Legislature would&nbsp;take several weeks and grow into an island-wide&nbsp;movement with strong popular support. In its&nbsp;aftermath it would amend the course of Taiwan&nbsp;politics, as well as its relation to China. It was a major&nbsp;contemporary event in Taiwan, and continues to&nbsp;influence the political landscape and societal&nbsp;reflection in the country. The occupation of the&nbsp;Legislature was streamed live, and when people&nbsp;vacated the chamber they left behind a massive&nbsp;amount of supporting artifacts and documentary&nbsp;materials. What would one do with these artifacts and&nbsp;materials, presumably soon to be abandoned,&nbsp;vanished and forgot? What could an archivist — or&nbsp;anyone who ever was involved in the movement — do&nbsp;in preparing for the future generations to remember&nbsp;the present events?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A few historians in Academia Sinica, Taiwan, seized this opportunity and reached a general agreement&nbsp;with the occupants to systematically collect what was&nbsp;in the Legislature main chamber before they would&nbsp;prepare to end the protest. Afterward Academia Sinica&nbsp;suddenly got hold of a large collection of artifacts&nbsp;created by thousands of participants in a&nbsp;contemporary event. In this paper we discuss a few&nbsp;issues involved in digitizing and archiving artifacts&nbsp;from contemporary events of this nature. We outline&nbsp;our approach to addressing them, and we present the&nbsp;current status of this archive. The archive is called the&nbsp;318 Civil Movement Archive at Academia Sinica. More&nbsp;background information about it can be found at the&nbsp;archive website [About]. As the movement started on&nbsp;March 18, 2014, has since better known as the&nbsp;Sunflower (Student) Movement [W-en] [W-zh-tw], in&nbsp;this paper the term Sunflower Movement Archive and&nbsp;the term 318 Civil Movement Archive will be used&nbsp;interchangeably to refer to the archive initiated at&nbsp;Academia Sinica. Often we simply call it the Archive.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Principle</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To strive for general access to the Sunflower Movement Archive probably was our topmost&nbsp;principle when we were starting to digitize the&nbsp;artifacts. This principle, however, shall be applied to a&nbsp;conflicting context of requirements and constraints.&nbsp;On the one hand, making the archive publicly&nbsp;accessible — on the Web of course — keeps Academia&nbsp;Sinica accountable to the activists (and to the public as&nbsp;well) about what it is doing. Academia Sinica will keep&nbsp;its promise in preserving all the artifacts it has&nbsp;acquired, and the proof is in the form of a Web catalog&nbsp;of all the digitized artifacts. On the other hand, as the&nbsp;artifacts are made by individuals, and some are of a&nbsp;personal nature (encouraging notes to the activists, for&nbsp;example), the individuals' personal privacy, publicity&nbsp;rights, as well as copyrights can be vulnerable when&nbsp;digital copies of the artifacts are made available for all&nbsp;to exam and use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Because of these considerations, only thumbnail images of the artifacts are made available on the Web&nbsp;for the Archive. The thumbnails are still useful for&nbsp;artifact identification (more about this later), but they&nbsp;are of no plausible other values. In addition, sensitive&nbsp;information inscribed in the artifacts, such as&nbsp;recognizable signatures and phone numbers, has to be&nbsp;pixelated to prevent misuse. No doubt there are&nbsp;boundary cases challenging our judgments. Often we&nbsp;will rather be safe than be sorry, hence will not release&nbsp;even thumbnail images at all for some artifacts. Still,&nbsp;how shall we deal with a banner with hundreds of&nbsp;signatures, sent in by overseas students to support the&nbsp;occupants? Scrubbing out all the signatures from the&nbsp;digital image of the banner will surly defeat the&nbsp;purpose of such an expression of solidarity. We make&nbsp;it a general rule that if it is a form of public&nbsp;communication, it shall be made public, even if there&nbsp;are personal information (names, signatures,&nbsp;affiliations, etc.) on the artifact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If what are made available are just thumbnail images and artifact metadata, a Web archive will not&nbsp;be too interesting. As participation to the movement is&nbsp;both personal and collective, we hope people will use&nbsp;the online archive to identify artifacts of their own&nbsp;(creation), and to make available high-resolution&nbsp;images of their artifacts to the public for general reuse.&nbsp;That is, we want the Web archive to be a conduit to&nbsp;help transit a collection of orphaned works into a&nbsp;domain of collective remembrance. A feature is built&nbsp;into the online catalog to allow registered users to&nbsp;identify artifacts of their own. Once identified, the user&nbsp;can choose to release the high-resolution image of the&nbsp;artifact to the public under one of the six Creative&nbsp;Commons Licenses, or more openly to elevate it to the&nbsp;public domain by using the CC0 Public Domain&nbsp;Dedication. Of course the claimant can choose to&nbsp;declare to reserve his/her copyright to the work. In&nbsp;this case, the high-resolution image will not be made&nbsp;public. To facilitate better search into the Archive,&nbsp;each item in the collection is annotated with rich&nbsp;metadata, including a transcription of the text&nbsp;appearing on the artifact (the words in a note, for&nbsp;example). People have used this feature to find and&nbsp;release artifacts of their making in spite of (or because&nbsp;of) the artifacts have been archived (and put online)&nbsp;for this historical event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the same time when the physical artifacts were being digitized, we also began to collect “born digital”&nbsp;documentary media such as photo images and&nbsp;audiovisual recordings. At the time of the Sunflower&nbsp;Movement, these media were widely dispersed on&nbsp;media sites (e.g. YouTube), social networks (e.g.&nbsp;Facebook), or Web storage services (e.g. Dropbox).&nbsp;After the event, these media may be removed for&nbsp;various reasons, buried in new materials, or hard to&nbsp;find. Many service providers where these media are&nbsp;hosted often scale down the uploaded originals into&nbsp;low-resolution media, transform them into less&nbsp;desirable formats, and/or strip out all the metadata&nbsp;embedded in the original media (e.g. EXIF data in&nbsp;photos). These tainted media are not for archival&nbsp;purposes. We chased down some of the most well-known citizen media activists who were broadcasting&nbsp;and reporting the events. We acquired batches of&nbsp;original files from them. By going after the original&nbsp;producers, we also get to keep better records of the&nbsp;provenance of the digital media in the collection. Many&nbsp;providers chose to donate the entire collections on&nbsp;their hard drives to the Archive, by using the CC0&nbsp;Public Domain Dedication.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use and Identification</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">We feel it necessary to have a Terms of Use (ToU) for the publicly accessible catalog to the Archive [ToU].&nbsp;By this, we will be able to communicate clearly to the&nbsp;public the purposes of the Archive, as well as various&nbsp;conditions and considerations in using the catalog. As&nbsp;the catalog is free and open to all, even without&nbsp;registration, to search and browse the Archive, we do&nbsp;not want the ToU to sound discouraging. Still, the&nbsp;catalog is the outcome of a provisional project at a&nbsp;research institution. We cannot really warrant the&nbsp;continuity and accuracy of the catalog and its&nbsp;associated services (in particular when funding was&nbsp;very uncertain in the beginning). Nor should we be&nbsp;held liable for people's use of these services. The ToU&nbsp;keeps users aware, and requests their understanding,&nbsp;of the right of publicity, the right to privacy, and other&nbsp;rights of the individuals whose artifacts are collected&nbsp;— or whose appearances are recorded — in the&nbsp;Archive. We also worry about the Archive being used&nbsp;by the authority as a source of evidences to pursue&nbsp;legal cases. Therefore, specifically in the ToU, we ask&nbsp;all users “not to cause civil or criminal disputes,” and&nbsp;“not to commit harassment, threat or other&nbsp;misconducts on any individual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We now demonstrate how anyone can use the Archive. Let us use as an example the hand-written&nbsp;note shown in Figure 2. This item is a small post-it note&nbsp;written by a student from the Chinese University of&nbsp;Hong Kong [10531]. It is part of a large panel sent in&nbsp;by the students from Hong Kong to support the&nbsp;students occupying the Legislature [12958]. The panel&nbsp;is shown in Figure 3, with all the notes attached to it,&nbsp;as it is in the catalog. Each note attached to the panel&nbsp;has been individually digitized and cataloged; the note&nbsp;in Figure 2 is but one of them on the panel. Figure 4 is&nbsp;a photo of the panel hanging on the wall of the main&nbsp;chamber of Legislature during the occupation. As the&nbsp;hand writing in the note has been transcribed into text&nbsp;and becomes part of the item's metadata, one can&nbsp;search for it in the catalog using a few key phrases. In&nbsp;the note, the student says s /he is from the Department&nbsp;of Social Work </span><span class="font10">(^±1^</span><span class="font11">). Using this three-character&nbsp;Chinese phrase, we search and indeed find this item in&nbsp;the catalog, as shown in Figure 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Would anyone actually use the catalog to search and identify his or her own artifacts? We asked this&nbsp;question ourselves when deciding to add functionality&nbsp;to the catalog to allow registered users to identify,&nbsp;online, artifacts of their own. We were not sure. But&nbsp;once the functionality is there, and after some&nbsp;publicity about our work on the Archive, some people&nbsp;do start to identify their works and mail us their&nbsp;Copyright Declaration and Release forms [Id]. Figure 6&nbsp;shows a work of art [18247]. It was identified by its&nbsp;creator using the catalog to the Archive. After the&nbsp;identification, he also releases the art work under a CC&nbsp;BY-NC-SA 3.0 TW license. By identifying it, the work&nbsp;can now be attributed to his name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zuoma). By</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">releasing his works under a Creative Commons license, he allows us to make available high-resolution&nbsp;images of his works for people to download. Figure 7A&nbsp;shows the template of the Copyright Declaration and&nbsp;Release form. A customized form will be generated&nbsp;automatically once an artifact has been identified by&nbsp;its maker. The PDF form will have included all the&nbsp;necessary information (about both the identifier and&nbsp;the identified item). It need only to be printed out,&nbsp;signed, and mailed in — no stamp required (Figure&nbsp;7B) — by the identifier to Academia Sinica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Who is Zuoma, the maker of the art work [18247], and what does he look like? People may ask. We shall&nbsp;know as we happen to meet him in person! In Figure&nbsp;8, he is holding his own work, now a part of the&nbsp;collection of the National Museum of Taiwan History&nbsp;(NMTH). Since November 2016, all physical artifacts in&nbsp;the Archive had been transferred to the museum by a&nbsp;mutual agreement between Academia Sinica and the&nbsp;NMTH. The photo was taken at a press event on 201611-14 at the NMTH, where a one-day conference was&nbsp;held on topics of preserving and archiving artifacts&nbsp;from contemporary events. By building information&nbsp;systems encouraging people to reconnect with&nbsp;artifacts that had been forced to be left behind, we aim&nbsp;to help resurrect and disseminate people's stories of&nbsp;the movement. In this particular case, we did get to&nbsp;learn why and how Zuoma made this and other art&nbsp;works in the Sunflower Movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Current Status</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The catalog of the Archive has been online since March 2015, roughly one year after the events setting off the&nbsp;Sunflower Movement. So far we have not received any&nbsp;complaint about putting the catalog online. For longterm preservation, Academia Sinica has made&nbsp;arrangement with the National Museum of Taiwan&nbsp;History (NMTH) to transfer the Archive to the&nbsp;Museum. The information systems managing the&nbsp;entire collection of digital media, including highresolution images of all the artifacts, are developed&nbsp;and released as open source software packages. As&nbsp;such, Academia Sinica and the NMTH can both host the&nbsp;digital archive on the Web. Currently the digital&nbsp;archive is still hosted at Academia Sinica even though&nbsp;all the artifacts had been transferred. The museum by&nbsp;itself has been collecting artifacts from various&nbsp;contemporary events for many years, including those&nbsp;from the Sunflower Movement. What Academia Sinica&nbsp;had collected were from the main chamber of the&nbsp;Legislature. The NMTH collects many more from other&nbsp;sources. There is a tentative plan between Academia&nbsp;Sinica and the NMTH to mutually enrich their digital&nbsp;collections on the Sunflower Movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An online recollection of the 318 Civil Movement, drawing from a group of individuals loosely connected&nbsp;to the people working on the Archive, was announced&nbsp;and made public on March 18, 2015, the first&nbsp;anniversary of the events. The recollection is a website&nbsp;expressed as a map of Taiwan covered with images&nbsp;and narratives; these are individual stories told with&nbsp;supporting materials drawn from the Archive or from&nbsp;other sources [Expo]. We imagine any person, any&nbsp;group of individuals, can use this catalog to the&nbsp;Sunflower Movement Archive to tell their stories. Each&nbsp;item in the catalog has a permanent link; anyone can&nbsp;use the links to weave stories about the various events&nbsp;in the movement.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Discussion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">Remembrance of contemporary events can be both personal and collective. When artifacts are collected&nbsp;from contemporary events, individual and public&nbsp;access considerations constrained what shall and can&nbsp;be done with the artifacts. We hope we have&nbsp;maintained a balance in setting up the Sunflower&nbsp;Movement Archive. We hope our experience can draw&nbsp;some attention to, and incite more discussion about,&nbsp;the issues that are involved in building archives of&nbsp;contemporary events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We would like to emphasize that the work on the Sunflower Movement Archive is but one among the&nbsp;many in the field of digital archiving and curation. We</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">opt not to give an overview of the best practices, nor cite the many literature, in this brief paper as we fear&nbsp;we cannot do it properly with the current time and&nbsp;space constraints. A balanced and comprehensive&nbsp;survey of the field will be obligatory when an extended&nbsp;version of this paper is to be prepared. Nevertheless&nbsp;we note that our effort is most related to the many&nbsp;existing works in catching the ephemeral but personal&nbsp;(as compared to those in holding on to the permanent&nbsp;and institutional). We look forward to learning from&nbsp;and further extending the practices in post-disaster&nbsp;remembrance and diasporic recollection.</span></p>
