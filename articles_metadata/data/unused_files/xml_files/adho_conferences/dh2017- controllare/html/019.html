<p><span class="font3">Too often, people lament that we have no evidence of what Shakespeare's readers thought. In reality, we&nbsp;have quite a bit of evidence, but it has been difficult to&nbsp;access because of the cost of travel and the barrier to&nbsp;access caused by early modern handwriting. This paper describes how </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx: A Database of Dramatic Extracts</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">(beta version</span><span class="font3">) contributes to the changing landscape of digital projects that help us better understand&nbsp;the early modern period. Rather than focusing on one&nbsp;person (too often, a canonical male literary figure),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3"> instead makes a wide range of reader responses&nbsp;to early modern drama searchable, bringing together&nbsp;resources that are held in geographically distant archives, from Oxford's Bodleian Library to the Folger&nbsp;Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dramatic extracts (those parts from plays that people copied into their notebooks) are important evidence because they tell what early modern audiences and readers took, literally and figuratively, from plays.&nbsp;Right now, this important evidence of reader response&nbsp;is difficult to access for multiple reasons: firstly, these&nbsp;extracts are often uncatalogued and therefore hard to&nbsp;locate. Secondly, they are dispersed across multiple archives and require travel funding to reach (see Ioppolo&nbsp;2004). Finally, they are written in early handwriting,&nbsp;and so require paleographical training to read. This&nbsp;paper examines the ways in which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3">, a comparatively small project, links to existing resources and&nbsp;draws on community to ultimately provide people access to evidence of what Shakespeare's readers&nbsp;thought. (Spoiler: it turns out they thought about&nbsp;other playwrights more than Shakespeare in his lifetime!) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3"> complements the Folger </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Union First Line&nbsp;Index</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts</span><span class="font3"> by making the full text of dramatic extracts&nbsp;searchable and by not being constrained to selections&nbsp;written in verse (like the former) or by canonical authors (like the latter). </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3"> includes materials that are&nbsp;not catalogued in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">CELM</span><span class="font3"> or repository catalogues, and&nbsp;invites scholars to contribute relevant citations, transcriptions, or leads they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3">'s transcriptions are part of what makes it so valuable. Despite advances in OCR (Optical Character&nbsp;Recognition) technologies, there is no adequate program to automatically recognize handwritten text:&nbsp;particularly when it comes to historical documents&nbsp;written in scripts that we no longer use today, such as&nbsp;chancery hand or secretary hand. While digital paleography is an ongoing area of research, it tends to focus&nbsp;now on transcribing and describing texts by hand or&nbsp;on teaching paleography with digital tools (Stokes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2014, 2015; Rehbein et al 2009, esp. 110-338; Fischer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">et al 2010; Hassner et al, 2013). Many digital projects that focus on early modern English texts are hand-transcribed and encoded: consider, for instance, the&nbsp;Folger Shakespeare Library's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Early Modern Manuscripts Online</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Shakespeare's World, The Recipes&nbsp;Project</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Bess of Hardwick's Letters.</span><span class="font3"> Transcriptions in&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3"> are undertaken by a small community of scholars:&nbsp;this paper explains how our community currently&nbsp;works and the future collaborations we hope to undertake, as well as the possible avenues for extending the&nbsp;project after its forthcoming full launch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 2010, Paul Conway argued that “We are at the end of ‘boutique' digital scanning projects for which&nbsp;the principal goal is ... extraordinary attention to the&nbsp;unique properties of each artifact” (76). This paper&nbsp;contends that with early modern manuscripts, “boutique” projects are one of the best ways forward. Compared to massive manuscript digitization projects like&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">British Literary Manuscripts Online</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3"> is a “boutique”&nbsp;project actually make texts searchable with transcription, which is always the result of paying attention to&nbsp;each manuscript as a “unique artifact.” This paper discusses the challenges that come with curating a boutique project and the ultimate benefits of having a&nbsp;small site that emerges from a specific set of research&nbsp;questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although small digitization or transcription projects can open up a vast field of research, they need to be findable and peer-reviewed in order to do so. I examine the obstacles to having </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx</span><span class="font3"> published by a traditional publisher, while questioning how to define&nbsp;publication for digital projects and the costs associated with creating and maintaining an open access&nbsp;site. Furthermore, I discuss how digital publishing&nbsp;must address the peer review needs of emerging&nbsp;scholars and provide an imprimatur and guarantee of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">quality for users. The final section of this paper discuss the role of Iter: Gateway to the Middle Ages and Renaissance and ReKN: Renaissance Knowledge Network in publication and peer review for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx: A Database of Dramatic Extracts</span><span class="font3">. This is an appropriate short&nbsp;paper for DH 2017 because it discusses a project that&nbsp;is in beta and active development, it engages the larger&nbsp;questions of how and why boutique digital projects&nbsp;can flourish and provide value to humanities scholarship, and it engages the theme of “Access/Accès” by focusing on collaboration, public-facing scholarship, and&nbsp;digital humanities publication. The paper focuses on a&nbsp;single case study: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">DEx: A Database of Dramatic Extracts&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">and its community, which addresses a much-needed&nbsp;gap in scholarship by transcribing manuscripts that&nbsp;tell us what Shakespeare's audience and readers actually read.</span></p>
