<p><span class="font6">Text reuse detection technology and approximate text matching have made possible the large-scale&nbsp;computational identi cation of intertextuality. These&nbsp;technologies have often been used in plagiarism&nbsp;detection and in studies of journalistic text reuse.&nbsp;Fewer studies, however, have applied these methods&nbsp;to humanities research. We present a method for&nbsp;quantifying the critical reception history of a source&nbsp;text by analyzing the precise location, density and&nbsp;chronology of its citations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our work builds on a recent set of digital humanities projects that use text reuse detection in&nbsp;order to study the afterlife of texts through textual&nbsp;quotation. The Viral Texts project and Digital&nbsp;Breadcrumbs of Brothers Grimm take algorithmic&nbsp;approaches to studying text reuse and circulation in&nbsp;their respective fields of research: nineteenth-century&nbsp;popular press and folklore. In both projects, the focus&nbsp;is on using text reuse detection to uncover hidden&nbsp;networks of reuse—the reprinting of short news items&nbsp;and the reuse of motifs or minimal narrative units in&nbsp;folklore—in corpora without standardized&nbsp;conventions of citation. Our project seeks to take this&nbsp;work a step further, by applying a similar method in a&nbsp;di erent area of cultural production where more&nbsp;standardized citation con- ventions already exist:&nbsp;academic citations. We draw on the work of Dennis&nbsp;Tenen—in using extracted citations to critically&nbsp;visualize the “knowledge domain” of Comparative&nbsp;Literature—and a recent project by JSTOR Labs that&nbsp;uses the text of Shakespeare’s plays and the U.S.&nbsp;Constitution to visualize the scholarship surrounding&nbsp;passages in those sets of texts (Tenen, forthcoming in&nbsp;2017). Like these projects, we hope to leverage the&nbsp;explicit and institutionalized nature of academic&nbsp;citation in studying text-reuse patterns, using text&nbsp;reuse to ask questions of critical attention in canon&nbsp;formation. By focusing initially on a single text in order&nbsp;to ask about its critical reception history, we hope to&nbsp;provide new methods for studying not only text-reuse&nbsp;patterns, but the sociology of citation practices—&nbsp;studying changes in when, how, and what critics cite&nbsp;from a given text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In applying these methods to literary scholarship, we’ve chosen to start on a relatively small scale.&nbsp;George Eliot’s novel Middlemarch is an ideal test case,&nbsp;due to its length, copyright status, stable editorial&nbsp;history and canonicity. Perhaps most appropriately&nbsp;for this study, Middlemarch is known for its narrator’s&nbsp;wise generalizations—highly quotable fragments that&nbsp;have been featured in more than one Victorian volume&nbsp;of George Eliot’s sayings. For the full project we are&nbsp;working with JSTOR Labs to assemble a corpus of all&nbsp;6,500 articles on Middlemarch in their collection. The&nbsp;gures below display preliminary results with a smaller&nbsp;483-sample corpus.</span></p><img src="264_files/264-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:116pt;"/>
<p><span class="font3">Figure 1. Citation Frequency Heat Map for Middlemarch, by Decade</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the largest scale, Figure 1 shows the frequency of citations across the whole of Middlemarch as a heat&nbsp;map segmented by decade, with yellow signifying the&nbsp;highest citation and black, no citations. Here, the novel&nbsp;is broken into 50 segments along the horizontal axis,&nbsp;and each segment is colored according to the number&nbsp;of times any part of its text has appeared in the critical&nbsp;literature. A number of overall trends are noticeable&nbsp;here. The very beginning and the end of the novel&nbsp;show the most numbers of quotations, followed by the&nbsp;rst quarter of the novel. Overall, the second half of the&nbsp;novel, except for the ending, is signi cantly less quoted&nbsp;from than the first half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Viewed chronologically, we see that critical interest in certain sections—as expressed in numbers of&nbsp;quotations—appears to shift over time. In the 1950s,&nbsp;most of the critical citation was of the end of the novel,&nbsp;at its climactic third-to-last section, but this interest&nbsp;has faded almost completely by the present day. At the&nbsp;same time, critical interest in the beginning of the&nbsp;novel seemed to be at a relative low point in the 1950s,&nbsp;but quickly became a highly quoted segment by the&nbsp;1970s. This shift may represent a change in critical&nbsp;attention to the parts of the novel, shifting from the&nbsp;end of the novel at midcentury to the beginning of the&nbsp;novel, where it still appears to rest.</span></p>

She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life&nbsp;involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and&nbsp;artificial protrusions of drapery.

<p><span class="font3">Figure 2. Citation Frequency Text Browser for Middlemarch</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Figure 2 shows a finer grained analysis, no longer segmented by decade, displaying an excerpt from our&nbsp;paragraph-level text browser for Middlemarch. Here&nbsp;again, the color coding represents the number of&nbsp;quotations of each segment, ranging from unquoted&nbsp;black passages, to infrequently quoted purple and red&nbsp;passages and more frequently quoted yellow ones. In&nbsp;our sample, the somewhat abstract contrast between&nbsp;“spiritual life” versus “gimp” and “drapery” remains&nbsp;unquoted, whereas the short, punchy “Her mind was&nbsp;theoretic” has triggered numerous quotations,&nbsp;peaking with the stirring phrase “some lofty&nbsp;conception of the world”, before the frequency falls&nbsp;again slightly as the narrator describes how this&nbsp;character’s idealism clashes with the real world. This&nbsp;annotated edition could provide both scholars and&nbsp;students of literature with a way to read the novel for&nbsp;passages that have been most discussed in secondary&nbsp;literature, and for passages that have been critically&nbsp;neglected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The potential applications of this methodology are numerous and wide-ranging. Firstly, this methodology&nbsp;can be used in any discipline to investigate the discipline’s theoretical history. As with the 1980 study of&nbsp;Wundt’s influence on the field of psychology (Brozek,&nbsp;1980), our methodology could rapidly and easily&nbsp;produce similar investigations for the influence of&nbsp;Saussure in linguistics, Bourdieu in sociology, Mead in&nbsp;anthropology, Beauvoir in feminist theory, and so on.&nbsp;Moreover, this analysis would be much more finegrained, registering not only the frequency of works&nbsp;cited but also specifc sections, passages and even key&nbsp;phrases within them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition, we see particular relevance of our methodology to disciplines substantially engaged in&nbsp;questions of quotation and commentary. In theology,&nbsp;com- mentaries on sacred texts could be analysed in&nbsp;this way to give insights into the texts’ interpretive&nbsp;history. In philosophy, the citation of key texts in later&nbsp;peri- ods could be used to assess the shifting priorities&nbsp;of subsequent generations of philosophers. Legal&nbsp;scholars, given the exceptional value placed on&nbsp;precedent in law, have long been interested in using&nbsp;digital technologies and studying citation practices&nbsp;(both of which underpin the recent Ravel project at&nbsp;Stanford University’s Law School), which our&nbsp;methodology would make even more granular (not&nbsp;just page numbers but exact phrases).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To return to literary studies, while our own initial project is focusing on academic literary criticism of the&nbsp;post-war period, the methodology could equally be&nbsp;applied to earlier aspects of literary reception. We are&nbsp;interested to examine whether patterns of citation&nbsp;change measurably since English literature is&nbsp;established as a discipline in the late nineteenth&nbsp;century. Going even further back, our methodology&nbsp;could equally be applied to quotations of literary&nbsp;works in non-academic formats, whether non-fiction&nbsp;(newspapers, journals, essays) or other literary works&nbsp;(citations of Shakespeare in Romantic poetry, say).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our own next steps in this project will be to expand our corpus of quoted texts—the single texts whose&nbsp;citations we are tracing. Do similar patterns of citation&nbsp;apply to Eliot’s other novels? Do they apply to novels&nbsp;by Dickens, or by Austen? These analyses will allow us&nbsp;to begin to formulate general hypotheses about&nbsp;patterns of quotation within literary scholarship of&nbsp;recent decades, while also offering unprecedented&nbsp;insights into the works of each of these authors.</span></p>
