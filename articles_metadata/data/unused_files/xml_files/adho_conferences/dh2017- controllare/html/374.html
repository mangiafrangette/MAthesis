<p><span class="font2">National Endowment for the Humanities United States of America</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How can you use open data to explore history?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Historic American newspapers illuminate the rich history and texture of life. They contain stories about&nbsp;politics, sports, music, shopping, food, health, science,&nbsp;movies, and everything in between. From the affairs of&nbsp;everyday life to major international events,&nbsp;newspapers enable humanists to delve into the past,&nbsp;providing vantage points in big cities and small towns,&nbsp;east and west, north and south, from various political,&nbsp;religious, and cultural standpoints, and multiple&nbsp;language and ethnic communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But what happens when cultural institutions make a large-scale set of historic newspaper data available?&nbsp;How are digital humanists able to use aggregated data&nbsp;from thousands of American news publications to tell&nbsp;stories and provide analysis, from the quotidian to the&nbsp;momentous? To find out, the U.S. National Endowment&nbsp;for the Humanities (NEH) asked the public “how can&nbsp;you use open data to explore history?” in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chronicling America Historic American Newspapers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Data Challenge</span><span class="font2">. This paper describes the challenge and its results, which serve as powerful reminders of the&nbsp;possibilities for matching open data collections with&nbsp;the tools and questions of the digital humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The nationwide competition, led by the NEH Division of Preservation &amp; Access, interrogated the&nbsp;possibilities for using the data in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Chronicling America</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a digital repository of historic United States&nbsp;newspapers. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicling America</span><span class="font2"> is an open access,&nbsp;searchable database of historic U.S. newspapers, with&nbsp;a newly expanded date range from 1690 to 1963 (the&nbsp;date range at the time of the challenge was 1836 to&nbsp;1922). The database and web site are produced by the&nbsp;National Digital Newspaper Program, a long-term&nbsp;partnership between the NEH and the Library of&nbsp;Congress (LC). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicling America</span><span class="font2"> includes millions&nbsp;of pages of digitized newspapers—nearly 12 million at&nbsp;the time of this writing, with more being added all the&nbsp;time—and descriptive information contributed by&nbsp;states and territories across the country. The LC&nbsp;supports the long-term management of the collection,&nbsp;including providing open access to the data through a&nbsp;well-documented </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">API</span><span class="font2"> to enable exploration of the&nbsp;collection in a variety of ways beyond the site’s web&nbsp;interface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To spur use of the API and collection, the Chronicling America Historic American Newspapers&nbsp;Data Challenge encouraged researchers to create&nbsp;digital humanities projects, big or small, using the&nbsp;newspaper data. The results demonstrate exciting&nbsp;possibilities for connecting the creators of digital&nbsp;collections and the humanities research communities&nbsp;using them. The contest urged entrants to use the data&nbsp;to show trends, insights, themes, or stories from&nbsp;history using newspaper data. The challenge’s&nbsp;parameters were broad, encouraging entrants to be&nbsp;creative in thinking about the humanities questions&nbsp;they find most compelling, and how they might&nbsp;approach them using open humanities data from&nbsp;newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The NEH awarded six prizes for the Chronicling America Historic American Newspapers Data&nbsp;Challenge in 2016. Far from being theoretical or&nbsp;speculative, the contest and the winning projects&nbsp;highlight the practical ways in which this data can be&nbsp;used to explore a variety of humanities themes. In&nbsp;brief, the winning projects were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">America's Public Bible: Bible Quotations in U.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Newspapers</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> by Lincoln Mullen. The site tracks Biblical quotations in American newspapers to show how the&nbsp;Bible was used for cultural, social, religious, and&nbsp;political purposes, and how it was a contested yet&nbsp;common text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">American Lynching: Uncovering a Cultural Narrative</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Andrew Bales. This site explores America’s long, dark history of lynching and the role of newspapers as both&nbsp;catalysts for killings and platforms for reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Historical Agricultural News</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> by Amy Giroux, Marcy Galbreath, and Nathan Giroux. The site is a tool for&nbsp;exploring information on farming organizations,&nbsp;technologies, and practices, as a window into social,&nbsp;economic, and political history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Chronicling Hoosier</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> by Kristi Palmer, Caitlin Pollock, and Ted Polley. This site tracks the origins of the word&nbsp;“Hoosier,” its geographic distribution, and its positive&nbsp;and negative connotations over time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">USNewsMap.com</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> by Claudio Saunt and Trevor Goodyear. This site allows users to discover patterns,&nbsp;explore regions, and investigate how words, terms,&nbsp;and news spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Digital APUSH,</span><span class="font2"> by Ray Palin and the A.P. U.S. History Students at Sunapee High School. This class used word&nbsp;frequency analysis to discover patterns in news&nbsp;coverage of several major issues such as secession, the&nbsp;KKK, and Plessy v. Ferguson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paper illustrates the potential impact of humanities collections such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicling America&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">when their data are made freely and easily available.&nbsp;It describes the data available in this huge data&nbsp;repository, the mechanisms researchers and students&nbsp;can use to access it, and some of the challenges&nbsp;inherent in its large span. The paper addresses some&nbsp;of the technical specifications and program guidelines&nbsp;for the National Digital Newspaper Program, in which&nbsp;metadata standards for both access and preservation&nbsp;were primary concerns for the NEH and the Library of&nbsp;Congress in creating and maintaining the program. It&nbsp;also explains how the program’s decade-old&nbsp;community has cultivated shared practices and&nbsp;specifications that contribute both to the longevity of&nbsp;this dataset and to other newspaper digitization&nbsp;efforts across the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then, the paper gives information about the winning entries in the first Chronicling America&nbsp;Historic American Newspapers Data Challenge in&nbsp;2016, which touched on a variety of important&nbsp;humanities themes like religion, race, literature,&nbsp;violence, agriculture, law, and geography. It explains&nbsp;how winners used cutting-edge technology to produce&nbsp;maps, visualizations, tools, and data mashups.&nbsp;Winners reported their initial questions, the&nbsp;importance of this data in answering them, their&nbsp;methods, and their future plans for the projects they&nbsp;built. This paper highlights their processes and the&nbsp;variety of results they produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Finally, the paper discusses broader lessons for humanities users of “big data” in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicling America.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">It shows the value of a contest in publicizing data in&nbsp;the humanities and its uses. It showcases different&nbsp;modes of collaboration among humanities&nbsp;researchers, libraries, information technology&nbsp;professionals, and other partners in the research&nbsp;endeavor. The paper also explores some of the&nbsp;challenges for humanities scholars working with large&nbsp;datasets, including representation, bias,&nbsp;categorization, and documentation. The intellectual&nbsp;work of the digital humanities projects described here</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">involves the same problem identifying and research that humanists have always pursued, but the methods&nbsp;and investigation present new questions and&nbsp;opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper suggests ways of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">maximizing the benefits of large datasets such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicling America</span><span class="font2"> to the humanities.</span></p>
