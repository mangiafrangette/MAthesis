<p><span class="font3">Digital humanities practices are often understood in terms of significant scale: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">big</span><span class="font3"> data, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">large</span><span class="font3"> data sets,&nbsp;digital humanities </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">centers</span><span class="font3"> (Terras et al. 2016; Kowalczyk et al. 2014; Borgman 2009; Kretzschmar&nbsp;2009). This emphasis leads to the perception that&nbsp;projects cannot be completed without substantial&nbsp;access to financial resources, data, and labor (Prescott 2016; Hockey 2016; Evans and Rees 2012). While&nbsp;this can be the case, such presumptions serve as a&nbsp;deterrent to the development of an inclusive digital&nbsp;humanities community with representation across&nbsp;academic hierarchies (student, librarian, faculty),&nbsp;types of institutions (public, private, regional), and&nbsp;geographies (Global North, Global South). In response, how can digital humanities scholars find value in work undertaken at a small scale? This question&nbsp;is at the heart of this paper theorizing the practices of&nbsp;micro digital humanities by reporting on initiatives at&nbsp;Salem State University. These practices include the&nbsp;embrace of minimal computing, small data sets, local&nbsp;archives, and freely available platforms for creating&nbsp;small-scale digital humanities projects while working&nbsp;with undergraduate students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work of the Minimal Computing Working Group has articulated a vision for minimal forms of&nbsp;digital humanities praxis (Minimal Computing Working Group 2015). Jentery Sayers (2016) has identified&nbsp;key components of minimal computing, including&nbsp;minimal design, maximum justice, and minimal technical language. These principles privilege access and&nbsp;openness for stakeholders across economic and technical barriers. More importantly, they are precepts&nbsp;that envision how digital humanities practices might&nbsp;be available to those who work outside of macro&nbsp;structures that have historically shaped digital humanities. This has been important at Salem State, a&nbsp;regional, public university undergoing an unprecedented budget crisis due to funding cuts from the&nbsp;state legislature. However, we have faculty and librarians who are committed to using digital humanities to&nbsp;cultivate digital and 21st century literacies in our students. As a result, we have conceptualized a micro&nbsp;digital humanities approach inspired by minimal&nbsp;computing. Micro DH validates scholarly output that&nbsp;does not require digital humanities centers, big data,&nbsp;large data sets, and access to high-performance computing. As an intervention in local digital humanities,&nbsp;it places high value on working with available resources, however small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Salem State, we have embraced micro digital humanities through our work with undergraduates.&nbsp;This talk explores these practices in depth, as a model&nbsp;for claiming the legitimacy of small-scale digital humanities. It considers how we have drawn on minimal&nbsp;university resources and existing institutional structures to build a digital humanities community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First, the focus of our work is our university’s archives and special collections, a diverse and free but untapped source of material. This choice emphasizes&nbsp;the primacy of local resources in micro digital humanities. Although Salem is known for its history of the&nbsp;Salem Witch Trials and literature of Nathaniel Hawthorne, our archives focus on the common person’s&nbsp;experience in Salem from the mid-19th century to&nbsp;present. This includes a rich history of immigration&nbsp;and activism. It exemplifies the power of micro digital&nbsp;humanities for the diversifying the historical record&nbsp;by giving voice to the ordinary and everyday. Through&nbsp;our work, we shed light on the hidden histories that&nbsp;shape Salem today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We undertake this work in service of our undergraduate students. Micro digital humanities is an approach that cuts across hierarchies in academic labor, bringing faculty, librarians, and students together to&nbsp;create small projects. Salem State is the most diverse&nbsp;state university in Massachusetts (35% students of&nbsp;color, 40% first-generation college students) and&nbsp;draws a primarily regional, working-class student&nbsp;population. Both the students and the university have&nbsp;few resources, but we work with what we have. To&nbsp;serve this population, we developed the Digital Scholars Program, piloted through a small grant from the&nbsp;university. We designed the program to answer the&nbsp;call of the university’s strategic plan to foster student&nbsp;success through research opportunities. Students apply to become Digital Scholars, and those who are&nbsp;selected are mentored through the process of creating&nbsp;a small-scale digital humanities project over the&nbsp;course of a semester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because they receive course credit rather than payment, we do not believe that we can, ethically, ask&nbsp;students to work on projects for us. Instead, the program is student-centered and student-led through a&nbsp;scaled down approach emphasizing the creation of&nbsp;micro projects. We select collections for the students&nbsp;to explore related to the history of Salem State then&nbsp;lead them through the experience of creating a digital&nbsp;humanities project from start to stopping point. The&nbsp;process includes making discoveries in the archives,&nbsp;identifying research questions that suit their interests, curating materials, envisioning project design,&nbsp;selecting platforms, and creating a final product - and&nbsp;all the iterative dimensions this process entails. Students also have access to professional development&nbsp;workshops and opportunities to engage with guest&nbsp;speakers who are themselves digital humanities practitioners. Projects our students have undertaken include recovering the history of LGBTQ activism at the&nbsp;university, revealing the colonialist gaze of Salem residents who traveled to India in the 1920s, creating&nbsp;historical models of the university’s oldest campus&nbsp;building, and connecting contemporary student activism around Black Lives Matter to the history of antiracist activism at the university in the 1970s. These&nbsp;projects have helped students engage in a range of&nbsp;practices: digitizing texts, TEI, Omeka, 3D modeling,&nbsp;quantitative textual analysis, data visualization, and&nbsp;oral history. In the spirit of micro digital humanities,&nbsp;we only use freely available resources or open source&nbsp;software we can host ourselves. This is a response to&nbsp;our lack of financial resources but is also a result of&nbsp;our focus on students; we do not want to force them&nbsp;to use proprietary technologies they may not be able&nbsp;to afford to access outside of a university or on their&nbsp;own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We situate this work as a practice of micro digital humanities, cutting across hierarchies to shift students from the position of consumer of digital media&nbsp;and technologies to the role of producer. This requires setting aside our preferences for what projects&nbsp;based on the collections should look like and recognizing that students will be working at a small scale.&nbsp;However, we view these small projects as pieces of a&nbsp;bigger puzzle that illuminates life in Salem. To bring&nbsp;these projects together, we developed an umbrella&nbsp;digital humanities project called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Digital Salem,</span><span class="font3"> a portal that aggregates student projects by collection. Users visiting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Digital Salem</span><span class="font3"> are offered multiple ports of&nbsp;entry into the history, culture, and literature of Salem.&nbsp;There, the small student projects add up as they contribute to a rich, varied resource on Salem. This experience has suggested how a micro digital humanities&nbsp;can be designed with emphasis connecting small projects as modular pieces that work together to form a&nbsp;bigger picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These micro digital humanities practices have been the foundation of the digital humanities community at the university. They have brought together&nbsp;faculty, librarians, and students to facilitate student&nbsp;research at a teaching-intensive university. Further,&nbsp;they offer a model for developing digital humanities&nbsp;at scales appropriate to institutional contexts and&nbsp;strategic planning. Perhaps more importantly, they&nbsp;offer a vision of digital humanities with learning&nbsp;curves and barriers to entry that do not require affiliation with centers, access to expensive technologies,&nbsp;or substantial resources. This, we argue, is essential&nbsp;to the development of an inclusive digital humanities&nbsp;community.</span></p>
