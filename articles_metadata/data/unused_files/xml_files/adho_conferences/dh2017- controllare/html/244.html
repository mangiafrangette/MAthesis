<p><span class="font2">This poster will explore the challenges of creating digitized historical spaces as faced through the design&nbsp;and subsequent exhibition of the interactive, open-access map, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition Raids in New Orleans, 19191933</span><span class="font2">. During Prohibition, Federal agents (or ‘Prohis')&nbsp;raided thousands of establishments throughout the&nbsp;city of New Orleans, arresting thousands more. Using&nbsp;data gleaned from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Times-Picayune</span><span class="font2">, one of New&nbsp;Orleans's oldest newspapers, this map documents the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">proliferation of these raids through the 1920s into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">early 1930s. Currently housed in </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">The Museum of the American Cocktail</span><span class="font2"> in New Orleans, this exhibit is a&nbsp;collaboration between the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Southern Food and Beverage Museum</span><span class="font2"> and my digital humanities project, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">In-temperance.org</span><span class="font2">, an Omeka archive of cocktail culture&nbsp;in New Orleans. The goals and questions raised by&nbsp;this project will be presented in this poster. These&nbsp;include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summarizing the historical context of the&nbsp;project and considering the ways in which&nbsp;early 20th century New Orleans constructed&nbsp;and created spaces of leisure, as well as assessing the cultural importance of the bars,&nbsp;restaurants, residences, and other locales&nbsp;raided by Prohibition agents;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring how to turn historical spaces into&nbsp;modern spaces in ways that are intuitive&nbsp;and accessible to diverse audiences and different publics;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. Optimizing user experience for those viewers unfamiliar with the historical information presented and/or the digital plat-form(s) with which the exhibit was created;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. Acknowledging the limitations of visualization and user experience of digitized historical spaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a project rooted in Public History, the challenge of achieving the aforementioned goals lay in the digital&nbsp;platform. This poster will explain the exhibit's functionality goals and specific interactivity issues encountered during the exhibition's creation. This includes the ability to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font2">optionally read a description of the exhibit and summarized history;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font2">view details of each individual Prohibition raid;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font2">organize and view raids by year;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font2">filter by type of establishment raided;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font2">zoom in, zoom out, and view the page in full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to achieve these goals, the exhibit was initially built in Neatline using the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Starter Theme from Scholars' Lab</span><span class="font2">, which works capably on any modern&nbsp;browser. Neatline advantageously allows users to explore the breadth of the historical archive by connecting Neatline points to Omeka items. When displayed&nbsp;on the Museum's multitouch tablet, however, issues of&nbsp;mobile compatibility and long loading times resulted&nbsp;in poor user experience. Ultimately, we had to modify&nbsp;the exhibition by changing the visualization platform&nbsp;to Tableau Public. Tableau not only circumvents the&nbsp;mobile compatibility issues found with Neatline, but&nbsp;it allows users to interactively filter historical data by&nbsp;year and raid type, a feature not currently possible in&nbsp;Neatline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While both Neatline and Tableau are capable platforms to achieve these goals, each has its own advantages. With these specific goals in mind, this poster will furthermore compare and contrast the advantages and limitations of Neatline and Tableau Public as both mobile and desktop interfaces. This poster</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">will furthermore highlight the exhibition's successful outcomes as well as the limitations of its interactivity.&nbsp;Much could be learned about visualization from the&nbsp;challenges faced in the creation of this exhibition.</span></p>
