<p><span class="font2">VisColl is a data model and associated tools that are designed to help scholars to visualize the physical&nbsp;collation of medieval manuscripts. In manuscript&nbsp;descriptions and library catalogs, a collation is&nbsp;normally given in the form of a formula, which&nbsp;describes each quire in terms of the position of that&nbsp;quire in the manuscript, how many leaves the quire&nbsp;contains, and if any leaves have been added or&nbsp;removed. A diagram may also be used to illustrate the&nbsp;same information, with the added benefit of clearly&nbsp;showing which leaves are conjoined (conjoined leaves&nbsp;are also known as bifolia). VisColl enables scholars to&nbsp;model the collation of manuscripts and then to present&nbsp;that information in various ways, including diagrams&nbsp;and formulas, but also in novel ways distinct from&nbsp;collating a manuscript by hand. For instance, in&nbsp;addition to visualizing the physical structure of a&nbsp;manuscript, the Beta Version of the VisColl data model&nbsp;currently under development enables users to create&nbsp;taxonomies describing the content of the manuscript,&nbsp;and other elements, which will enable tools to link&nbsp;those taxonomies to the physical structure, producing&nbsp;a more robust and descriptive visualization than is&nbsp;possible in the current system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">VisColl was conceived in the mid-2000s by Dot Porter during her work at the Collaboratory for&nbsp;Research in Computing for Humanities at the&nbsp;University of Kentucky (UKY). Porter developed the&nbsp;tool in order to address issues she encountered in&nbsp;effectively visualizing standard descriptions of&nbsp;manuscripts in scholarly works. For instance, in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript</span><span class="font2"> Kevin Kiernan&nbsp;uses the physical construction of the manuscript to&nbsp;make arguments about the dating of the text (separate&nbsp;from the dating of the manuscript itself). In addition,&nbsp;Ben Withers (of UKY), in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Illustrated Old English&nbsp;Hexateuch, Cotton MS. Claudius B.IV: the Frontier of&nbsp;Seeing and Reading in Anglo-Saxon England,</span><span class="font2"> similarly&nbsp;used a detailed collation statement of the manuscript&nbsp;as the backbone for his investigation of the&nbsp;construction of the manuscript. There are numerous&nbsp;examples of scholarly works that build an argument&nbsp;about the dating and construction of manuscripts&nbsp;based on the collation of the physical object. In&nbsp;consulting such works, Porter saw an opportunity to&nbsp;enable readers to better visualize the structure of the&nbsp;object beyond the limitations of traditional formulas,&nbsp;diagrams, and collation statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Digitized medieval manuscripts are typically viewed through page-turning interfaces, which give&nbsp;the impression of page openings, but lack the physical&nbsp;cues present in a physical book, i.e., the size of the&nbsp;book, its thickness, details of the parchment or paper,&nbsp;etc. Indeed, page-turning interfaces do not usually&nbsp;show a picture of book openings at all, but rather they&nbsp;are composites made with two images: one of the leftside page and another of the right-side page. These&nbsp;images would have been taken at different times.&nbsp;Typically all images of one side pages are taken first,&nbsp;e.g. all the rectos, then of the other side, and then file&nbsp;names or structural metadata are used to order the&nbsp;files correctly in post processing. Most digital libraries&nbsp;provide some information on the pages depicted, and&nbsp;views other than single pages: all provide information&nbsp;on the folio number and the side (recto or verso)&nbsp;shown; some indicate the quire number, and some&nbsp;offer a variety of viewing modes, such as single pages,&nbsp;double pages, pages of thumbnails or thumbnails&nbsp;presented filmstrip-style across the bottom of a page.&nbsp;However, again, for the most part, the focus of these&nbsp;resources is on the page, rather than on the physical&nbsp;object. Even the Turning the Pages™ software,&nbsp;conceived by the British Library in 1996 (and&nbsp;developed by Amarillo Systems since 2001), which,&nbsp;since version 2.0 (2006), has produced realistic threedimensional books (including the ability to mimic the&nbsp;different movement of paper and parchment pages as&nbsp;these are turned), lacks any modelling of the gathering&nbsp;structure. To present knowledge, there is no&nbsp;institutional digital library that describes the&nbsp;physicality of manuscripts outside of the standard&nbsp;Physical Description section of the manuscript records&nbsp;and collation formulas.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Alpha Version of the VisColl data model is implemented in the Collation Modeler and the&nbsp;Collation Visualizer hosted at the University of&nbsp;Pennsylvania, but the data model was envisioned as&nbsp;agnostic and was designed to be easily used by other&nbsp;collation tools. The University of Toronto, through a&nbsp;Mellon-funded project entitled Digital Tools for&nbsp;Manuscript Study, is developing a robust VisColl web&nbsp;application which implements the Beta Version of the&nbsp;data model, and allows users to visually manipulate&nbsp;and present diagrams and metadata in real time, while&nbsp;also making use of the International Image&nbsp;Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to integrate digital&nbsp;manuscript images alongside scholarly work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This poster will document the stages of the development of VisColl, from its conception to its&nbsp;current instantiation, highlighting the steps taken and&nbsp;the reasoning behind each new actualization of the&nbsp;project, and will also serve as a demonstration of the&nbsp;current version of the tool developed by the University&nbsp;of Toronto Libraries. Documentation and code of this&nbsp;version can be found and downloaded from the&nbsp;University of Toronto Libraries’ GitHub page. The&nbsp;current state of development can be found at VisColl's&nbsp;GitHub page, which documents each new build, and&nbsp;from which the project's code can be downloaded.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
