<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many leading universities in the United States have recognized the profoundly transformative effect that&nbsp;DH has had on research and teaching and have&nbsp;established lab-based research programs or&nbsp;institutional centers for interdisciplinary&nbsp;collaboration on digital projects in the humanities. The&nbsp;University of Virginia led with the Institute for&nbsp;Advanced Technology in the Humanities, which now&nbsp;supports more than forty DH research projects. The&nbsp;Stanford Humanities Laboratory, established in 2001,&nbsp;is a collaborative research environment for crossdisciplinary and multi-institutional, technologically&nbsp;transformative projects. Duke, a founding member of&nbsp;HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology&nbsp;Advanced Collaboratory), adopted a similar model&nbsp;within its John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute.&nbsp;Other universities such as Harvard, Brown,&nbsp;Dartmouth, Berkeley, Princeton, and the University of&nbsp;Michigan have begun aggressively to hire in the field&nbsp;and to design multidisciplinary DH programs.&nbsp;Moreover, University of Pennsylvania and Yale have&nbsp;attracted large donations from alumnae for DH&nbsp;institutes, while state institutions like Maryland,&nbsp;Nebraska, and UCLA have garnered millions of dollars&nbsp;in external funds to support their field-leading digital&nbsp;scholarship centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Digital Humanities scholarship is, by necessity, collaborative and interdisciplinary. DH approaches to&nbsp;the creation and dissemination of scholarship&nbsp;investigate the information life cycle from digitization&nbsp;to preservation including multimediality, design&nbsp;elements, and computational reasoning and&nbsp;implementation through perspectives developed in&nbsp;the context of deep understandings of the key issues at&nbsp;stake in the humanities. DH approaches to teaching&nbsp;typically involve an emphasis on experiential learning&nbsp;and research by creatively expanding modes of access&nbsp;and networks of participation through the methods&nbsp;that students employ. This multidisciplinary work in&nbsp;research and teaching is not limited to conventional&nbsp;humanities departments, but, rather, emerges in every&nbsp;humanistic field, in arts and architecture, information&nbsp;studies, film and media studies, archaeology,&nbsp;geography, ethnic studies, and the social sciences.&nbsp;Because of this essentially multidisciplinary nature of&nbsp;DH work, some of the universities listed above have&nbsp;begun to move away from more traditional models of&nbsp;DH where DH is housed in the library or where DH is&nbsp;primarily an endeavor of the English or History&nbsp;Department. Northeastern University's center for&nbsp;Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science&nbsp;(NULab) and King's College DH Department, for&nbsp;example, bridge the humanities and computational,&nbsp;qualitative social sciences while Bard College's&nbsp;Experimental Humanities Concentration and Initiative&nbsp;is focused primarily on the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even with all this funding and enthusiasm, however, it remains surprisingly challenging to design&nbsp;curricula in DH on the undergraduate and graduate&nbsp;level. These challenges are a direct result of the fact&nbsp;that attempts to develop new paradigms and models&nbsp;for &quot;training&quot; students break (or stretch) molds for&nbsp;learning and teaching that have calcified over decades&nbsp;into departmental silos and administrative policies&nbsp;concerning credits and teaching loads. These&nbsp;challenges include the difficulty of organizing teaching&nbsp;arrangements that include faculty from multiple&nbsp;disciplines, supporting cluster hires versus supporting&nbsp;&quot;reskilling&quot; faculty to teach new methods from&nbsp;different perspectives, and designing single courses&nbsp;with heavy loads of material including perspectives on&nbsp;the world (such as cultural critique) alongside&nbsp;advanced topics in, for example, statistical models,&nbsp;computational approaches, and data visualization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This panel will include representatives from five programs who bring perspectives from both private&nbsp;and public, large research universities and small&nbsp;liberal arts colleges in the United States. The panelists&nbsp;have worked within the context of long-standing&nbsp;digital humanities centers as well as within initiatives&nbsp;just now developing without these historical,&nbsp;infrastructural legacies. Each panelist will speak for&nbsp;twelve to fifteen minutes on the below topics, leaving&nbsp;time for questions from and conversations with the&nbsp;audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tanya Clement</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many years, Digital Humanities at the University of Texas at Austin has happened on a&nbsp;project-level basis, without the support of a DH center,&nbsp;in American Studies, Anthropology, Classics, English,&nbsp;French and Italian, History, Information Studies, and in&nbsp;Portuguese and Spanish, among other departments&nbsp;(some projects can be viewed at the UT DH page)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At UT, we are experiencing a scenario that is familiar at universities and colleges that are supported&nbsp;by instantiated DH centers and initiatives. The&nbsp;existing, funded projects at UT do not offer enough&nbsp;project-based, training opportunities for a wide range&nbsp;of students. Project-based work with digital&nbsp;information technologies is often heralded as the site&nbsp;of work that defines DH (Burdick, et. al, 2012; Drucker,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2012; Hayles, 2012; Svensson, 2009, 2012). It is also the site of experiential learning and project-based&nbsp;research in DH on the undergraduate and graduate&nbsp;level, a trend that is noticeable in many of the lessons&nbsp;and curricula collected in the recent Modern Language&nbsp;Association publication, Digital Pedagogy in the&nbsp;Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments. Even&nbsp;with this fabulous array of DH classroom-based&nbsp;assignments, the students who are best trained in DH&nbsp;-- those who on the graduate level are best prepared&nbsp;for the job market in private and public industry as&nbsp;well as the academy -- remain those students who&nbsp;participate in the kinds of long-term, interdisciplinary-team-led projects that have become the mainstay of&nbsp;DH. These kinds of projects, however, usually only have&nbsp;the funding to train a handful of lucky students. At UT,&nbsp;we are working to consider a different paradigm for&nbsp;teaching and training students that is not dependent,&nbsp;primarily, on the soft-money world that remains the&nbsp;status quo for most underfunded DH projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To better understand our proposed methods of training, it is important to describe the UT landscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The University of Texas at Austin is a large research university with over 3,000 teaching faculty and over&nbsp;50,000 students. It is rich in multicultural, multimedia,&nbsp;obscure and popular special collections of interest to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">humanities scholars. Some examples include the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gloria Anzaldua archives, the Guatemalan National Police Historical Archive (AHPN), and the Radio&nbsp;Venceremos collection of digital audio recordings of&nbsp;guerrilla radio from the civil war in El Salvador housed&nbsp;in the Benson Latin American Collection. The papers of&nbsp;Carson McCullers, David Foster Wallace, and Gabriel&nbsp;Garcia Marquez as well as many collections of&nbsp;medieval and early modern manuscripts including one&nbsp;of five copies of the Gutenberg Bible in the United&nbsp;States are at the Harry Ransom Center, which also&nbsp;holds a robust collection of film (including the archive&nbsp;of Robert Dinero), photographs (such as the Magnum&nbsp;Photos' New York bureau collection, dating from 1929&nbsp;to 2004), and authors' recordings including tapes of&nbsp;Anne Sexton's therapy sessions and Spalding Gray's&nbsp;performances alongside the center's other robust&nbsp;collections of twentieth century writers and&nbsp;performing artists. At the Briscoe Center for American&nbsp;History there is the Texas Poster Art Collection which&nbsp;documents the visuals behind the pivotal early music&nbsp;careers (1960s to 1970s) of iconic music legends such&nbsp;as Willie Nelson and Townes Van Zandt as well as over&nbsp;2000 reels of tape that include the field recordings of&nbsp;folklorists John A. Lomax, William A. Owens, Americo&nbsp;Paredes, and John Henry Faulk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The list of amazing collections at UT goes on, but in terms of DH, it doesn't matter. Most of these materials,&nbsp;like most of the materials (no matter if they are paper,&nbsp;reels, tape, or photographs) in special collections at&nbsp;many institutions are almost completely inaccessible&nbsp;to DH methods of presentation and inquiry - </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">even&nbsp;when they are digitized.</span><span class="font5"> These materials are either&nbsp;under copyright; in non-text formats such as an image,&nbsp;audio, or video file; undescribed (and therefore, in&nbsp;many cases, undiscoverable); or unstructured; all of&nbsp;which make them unsuitable for most DH tools.&nbsp;Instead, UT scholars and teachers, like scholars and&nbsp;teachers everywhere, typically use the same&nbsp;collections that others use: what is freely available&nbsp;online - a trend that systematically limits the kinds of&nbsp;questions we can ask in DH scholarship and teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At UT, we are trying to address these issues in our plans to create an undergraduate and graduate&nbsp;curriculum in DH by considering three primary&nbsp;questions that plague DH curriculum development&nbsp;everywhere:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1. How do we train a wide range of students on the&nbsp;undergraduate and graduate levels across a&nbsp;wide range of DH issues including, but not&nbsp;limited to, the creation of digital collections and&nbsp;archives; the analysis of digital materials; and&nbsp;the use of digital technologies to write, publish,&nbsp;and consume scholarship when our faculty are&nbsp;siloed from each other not only by&nbsp;administrative departments but by their,&nbsp;sometimes, many decades of differing&nbsp;experiences and training?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2. How do we teach students to consider&nbsp;multimedia and multiculturalism when using&nbsp;DH methods when the primary materials to&nbsp;which we have “data ready” access are text-based, in English, and unstructured?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">3. How do we create an interdisciplinary&nbsp;framework that is productive and innovative as&nbsp;well as sustainable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Building on the amazing work done by DH scholars in praxis-based training programs in libraries such as the&nbsp;Scholars Lab at the University of Virginia, Columbia's&nbsp;Developing Librarian Project, and Indiana University's&nbsp;Research Now: Cross Training for Digital Scholarship&nbsp;initiative, the DH@UT initiative is imagining a&nbsp;sustainable model for training students that is&nbsp;experiential, collaborative, and interdisciplinary.&nbsp;Collections are at the heart of humanities research.&nbsp;The work to make such collections “data ready” for DH&nbsp;scholarship coincides with deep expertise in the&nbsp;humanities as it relates to the organization,&nbsp;preservation, curation, analysis, visualization, and&nbsp;communication of digital works in the humanities.&nbsp;Pairing students with projects for making the&nbsp;collections at UT more accessible offers a unique&nbsp;opportunity to train students to generate a more&nbsp;diverse range of data-ready collections and to immerse&nbsp;them in questions surrounding critical information&nbsp;infrastructure studies (Clement, 2015; Liu 2016;&nbsp;Verhoeven 2016) that has engaged staff,&nbsp;undergraduates, graduates, and faculty at the heart of&nbsp;DH research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Questions remain, however, about how such a program could be implemented. Faculty from a variety&nbsp;of disciplines will have to commit to using UT&nbsp;collections that perhaps do not fit exactly into their&nbsp;research objectives. The time commitments of library&nbsp;and archives staff, who are already often overwhelmed&nbsp;and under resourced, will need to be committed to the&nbsp;goals of the program; and, policies concerning how&nbsp;and when archival materials can cross the transom of&nbsp;the brick-and-mortar collection building (both&nbsp;physically and virtually due to copyright and privacy&nbsp;restrictions) will have to be reconsidered. There is&nbsp;reason to believe that faculty, used to “stretching” their&nbsp;area of expertise to teach classes, would be willing to&nbsp;commit their considerable effort in teaching classes in&nbsp;these new directions. There is equal reason to believe&nbsp;that staff members, committed to the goals of the&nbsp;institution to make their collections more accessible&nbsp;will also be in favor of such a program. Yet, in order to&nbsp;make this program sustainable, both faculty and staff&nbsp;will need support from upper administration.&nbsp;Commitment at the university level for innovative&nbsp;teaching and research remains imperative for&nbsp;changing the praxis of pedagogy. This talk will discuss&nbsp;our progress in these endeavors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alison Booth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Technological literacy is a stated educational goal for all students at the University of Virginia, and&nbsp;various existing groups in the Library and schools such&nbsp;as Arts and Sciences support teaching with technology&nbsp;and short assignments in courses (maps; e-portfolios,&nbsp;etc.; Learning Design Technology). But many would&nbsp;agree that digital humanities is something distinct&nbsp;from teaching with technology; there is more to be&nbsp;gained from student participation in open-ended&nbsp;projects (exceeding the timeframe of a single&nbsp;assignment) that reflect upon their tools and methods&nbsp;as well as on the specific data of a discipline.&nbsp;Considerable international discussion of DH pedagogy&nbsp;has advanced the field (Digital Pedagogy), and several&nbsp;textbooks serve courses that introduce students to DH&nbsp;(e.g. Gold and Klein). Certificates in DH (e.g. at&nbsp;Northeastern University and University of Maryland)&nbsp;provide models, as do departments of Digital&nbsp;Humanities (as at King's College, London). CenterNet&nbsp;presents a directory of DH centers on every continent,&nbsp;some like UCLA's Center for Digital Humanities&nbsp;offering a program with an undergraduate minor and&nbsp;graduate certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are the best models? How should we build an infrastructure for DH education at the University of&nbsp;Virginia, based on what we already have? The&nbsp;University of Virginia has longstanding centers&nbsp;practicing DH: the Institute for Advanced Technology&nbsp;in the Humanities, SHANTI, Scholars' Lab. Advanced&nbsp;research projects and courses or workshops in&nbsp;methods and tools are supported as well in Research&nbsp;Data Services, Data Sciences Institute, Makerspaces in&nbsp;arts, architecture, and engineering, among others. And&nbsp;yet the curricular offerings in DH have remained&nbsp;dispersed among a few academic departments and the&nbsp;Scholars' Lab's Praxis Program and fellowships, along&nbsp;with some digital fellowships for undergraduates&nbsp;working in art and archeology. I suggest a model: the&nbsp;Pedagogical Pyramid, which can be multiplied within&nbsp;one or many institutions in communities of&nbsp;interaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is a Pedagogical Pyramid a menacing structure, an image of hierarchy and exploitative labor? Instead, it&nbsp;is intended as a metaphor and visualization&nbsp;(equilateral triangle in multiple dimensions) of a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">graduated</span><span class="font5"> structure of collaborations, potentially&nbsp;across institutions as well as UVA schools, on advanced&nbsp;research in the humanities, arts, and social sciences:&nbsp;more undergraduates, fewer graduate students, and&nbsp;fewer faculty. The numbers, limited only by practicable&nbsp;scales of collaboration, are flexible, but based on likely&nbsp;proportion of an institution's personnel in these ranks.&nbsp;The paid internships, fellowships, and mentorships&nbsp;proposed in this structure would be available in&nbsp;smaller numbers for team members who are at later&nbsp;career stages, but there will be no idle supervisory&nbsp;roles for those figuratively at the top. Participants&nbsp;would develop a charter in keeping with the&nbsp;Collaborators' Bill of Rights. With sufficient resources&nbsp;for faculty as well as students (stipends, wages,&nbsp;facilitators and spaces), we would run concurrent&nbsp;Pyramids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have developed parts of such a vision. IATH supports two residential fellows per year for two years&nbsp;each, with some course release and research funds.&nbsp;The Scholars' Lab under Bethany Nowviskie created a&nbsp;custom-built, annual cohort of six doctoral fellows&nbsp;who collaborate on a project. Praxis flourished under&nbsp;Purdom Lindblad and current members of Scholars'&nbsp;Lab, and has generated a Praxis Network connecting&nbsp;various institutions. Each year in addition there are 23 dissertation fellows in the Scholars' Lab, and we have&nbsp;had graduate fellows jointly in Data Sciences and&nbsp;Scholars' Lab. Undergraduates and graduates are&nbsp;employed in the Scholars' Lab Makerspace, and any&nbsp;students or faculty may work on any projects in that&nbsp;innovative research laboratory. We collaborate with a&nbsp;liberal arts college in Virginia, Washington &amp; Lee, that&nbsp;adopted the Praxis model in its library-centered DH&nbsp;Studio; UVA and W&amp;L hold exchanges among both&nbsp;institutions' Library staff, UVA's Praxis and DH fellows,&nbsp;and W&amp;L's undergraduate students. Scholars' Lab has&nbsp;also led two summer programs for 4-6 Leadership&nbsp;Alliance Mellon Initiative (LAMI) undergraduate&nbsp;students from HCBUs and Puerto Rico, introducing DH&nbsp;and other research methods in preparation for&nbsp;graduate school applications. Collective Biographies of&nbsp;Women, an IATH and Scholars' Lab project, each year&nbsp;trains small groups of graduate research assistants&nbsp;(primarily MA) and a few paid undergraduates; LAMI&nbsp;students each summer have added research on African&nbsp;American and Latino cohorts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Which brings us to planning the future of a DH community at UVA. Recent developments have focused&nbsp;on coordinating the community in a DH@UVA website&nbsp;and the DH@UVA 2016 conference, at which the open&nbsp;discussion came to a consensus on a certificate or&nbsp;program in DH. We do not want to build a DH&nbsp;department, as that may be less adaptable for future&nbsp;technological and curricular change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Desirables</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font5"> early introduction to digital research methods in interdisciplinary courses, workshops, and&nbsp;bootcamps suitable for undergraduates, graduate&nbsp;students, or both; engagement of undergraduates (for&nbsp;credit or pay) in faculty or graduate-student research&nbsp;projects in humanities, arts, and social sciences,&nbsp;beyond the classroom assignment; opportunities for&nbsp;graduate students to mentor and teach these&nbsp;undergraduates; paid graduate interns and project&nbsp;managers mentored by Library-affiliated faculty and&nbsp;staff who can work with faculty projects from many&nbsp;departments; different models of support for faculty&nbsp;digital scholarship beyond the IATH fellowships;&nbsp;expansion beyond the six Praxis students and 2-3 DH&nbsp;dissertation fellows per year that we currently support&nbsp;in Scholars' Lab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Challenges for building such alliterative pyramids: </span><span class="font5">persuading more faculty to participate and&nbsp;encourage their students in these opportunities;&nbsp;luring the CS faculty and students, the Data Sciences&nbsp;Institute, and the Library's Research Data Services&nbsp;group to collaborate with humanistic computational&nbsp;research, increasing broad interdisciplinarity;&nbsp;coordinating with the Graduate School and other&nbsp;schools to fund graduate fellowships, encourage&nbsp;dissertation advisors' participation, and monitor time-to-degree; securing additional resources for wages&nbsp;and faculty stipends as well as graduate fellowships&nbsp;and teaching release; negotiation with Directors of&nbsp;Undergraduate Studies and Graduate Studies as well&nbsp;as the Graduate School regarding requirements, credit&nbsp;courses and a certificate or program, which would&nbsp;have to be maneuvered through the channels of&nbsp;educational policy at university and state levels.&nbsp;Curriculum would have to be designed that allows&nbsp;discipline-specific units to be added to shared units on&nbsp;generally applicable tools, methods, and issues. The&nbsp;structures would have to ensure that all contributors&nbsp;are compensated and acknowledged, including in&nbsp;presentations and publications. UVA already has&nbsp;ample evidence of the enhancement of research and&nbsp;the advantages in students' learning and placement&nbsp;that come from the existing activities in DH groups. We&nbsp;look forward to giving these aims more substance and&nbsp;structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ryan Cordell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During MLA 2013, Natalia Cecire wryly observed on Twitter, “1. DHers usually don't see dh as panacea.&nbsp;2. Admins often do. 3. DHers often need for admins to&nbsp;have this erroneous belief.” Our experiences building a&nbsp;graduate DH curriculum at Northeastern in many ways&nbsp;illustrate this rhetorical tension. We benefit from&nbsp;substantial administrative support for curricular&nbsp;ingenuity while struggling to reconcile that support&nbsp;with increasing disquiet in the departments that must&nbsp;underwrite any substantive changes we seek to make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are enormously fortunate at Northeastern and the NULab. Our administration has funded several&nbsp;years of cluster hires, which have allowed us to bring&nbsp;DH faculty into the English; History; and Cultures,&nbsp;Societies and Global Studies departments, as well as&nbsp;DH faculty and staff in the library. Over the course of&nbsp;four years we have founded a new center, integrated&nbsp;introductory and advanced DH courses into our&nbsp;curriculum, launched a DH graduate certificate&nbsp;program, and trained many students through work on&nbsp;locally- and grant-funded projects. This in turn has led&nbsp;to an increased number of students applying to our&nbsp;graduate programs seeking DH training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This rapid, whole-cloth invention of a DH program, however, has been attended by pressures, fissures, and&nbsp;tensions with existing programs. For example, NULab&nbsp;faculty are proud of the robust coursework required&nbsp;for the DH certificate program: the equivalent of 3&nbsp;courses out of the 10 required in our English MA&nbsp;program or 14 required in our English Ph.D., plus the&nbsp;development of a small scale DH project. Our students&nbsp;take not only an introductory DH course, but also&nbsp;advanced methods courses (data modeling, text&nbsp;analysis, etc.) that prepare them to integrate DH&nbsp;methods into their theses and compete for DH&nbsp;positions after graduation. Within English, however,&nbsp;completing this requirement requires students to&nbsp;decide their path almost immediately upon admission,&nbsp;and the decision to pursue the certificate dictates very&nbsp;particular paths through the larger Ph.D. program.&nbsp;While our DH faculty are a larger group than at most&nbsp;institutions, even so we cannot practically mount more&nbsp;than two courses per year: an introductory course&nbsp;each fall and an advanced course each spring. These&nbsp;advanced courses rotate among NULab faculty and&nbsp;thus have very distinct foci. Thus students' options for&nbsp;completing coursework remain relatively constrained&nbsp;over two years of full time coursework in ways that&nbsp;sometimes mitigate against the particular training&nbsp;individual's need. A student primarily interested in&nbsp;digital archive creation, for instance, might by&nbsp;necessity take their advanced course in Humanities&nbsp;Data Analysis rather than Data Modeling; while the&nbsp;latter would be more appropriate to their interests it&nbsp;can only be offered every three years or so, when a&nbsp;particular faculty member is on rotation for the&nbsp;advanced seminar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These pressures are compounded for MA students in English or Public History; in the latter case we find&nbsp;there is really only one viable set of courses that can&nbsp;result in both a DH certificate and Public History&nbsp;credential within the timeline of the program. Due to&nbsp;these challenges, NULab faculty are currently&nbsp;reevaluating how to align our high expectations for DH&nbsp;training with the practical realities of a certificate&nbsp;program, which must exists alongside and in harmony&nbsp;with the primary curricular structures of humanities&nbsp;departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to pressures on students, the popularity of the DH certificate among its first two cohorts of&nbsp;students has led to growing worry among&nbsp;departmental faculty that DH is driving down&nbsp;enrollments outside certificate program courses. We&nbsp;might be tempted toward market explanations (“we&nbsp;cannot dictate which courses students are interested&nbsp;in” or, less generously, “if our colleagues made their&nbsp;courses more enticing”) but these are neither&nbsp;sufficient nor reflective. The NULab has created a&nbsp;certification that students perceive as necessary in a&nbsp;competitive job market, despite ambiguity about the&nbsp;role of DH in securing jobs (Risam 2013). Thus we&nbsp;have institutionalized a hierarchy of graduate course&nbsp;offerings that does privilege DH courses over others in&nbsp;the curriculum, in ways that partially reflect students'&nbsp;interests but partly reflect their anxieties. Moreover,&nbsp;the administration's vision for graduate education in&nbsp;the future clearly emphasizes digital humanities in&nbsp;ways that worry even NULab faculty. We cannot, in&nbsp;other words, entirely dismiss our colleagues' worries&nbsp;about how digital humanities, which belongs to no&nbsp;department in particular, has shifted the character and&nbsp;priorities of graduate programs in the particular&nbsp;departments of English and History.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In my presentation, then, I will think through what constitutes a successful DH graduate curriculum in an&nbsp;institutional culture of abundant top-down support&nbsp;and atrophying bottom-up enthusiasm. Can we&nbsp;structure robust DH training in ways that integrates&nbsp;with rather than competing with departmental&nbsp;training? Can a DH program be partner rather than&nbsp;usurper?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Miriam Posner</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">UCLA's Digital Humanities graduate certificate, founded in 2011, now enrolls 24 Ph.D. and master's&nbsp;degree students from across the university. Initially,&nbsp;the certificate was conceived as a means of providing&nbsp;an imprimatur for work that was already taking place&nbsp;at the graduate level. UCLA's humanities graduate&nbsp;students were already apprenticing on a wide range of&nbsp;faculty-led digital humanities projects, such as&nbsp;HyperCities and RomeLab, and developed a great deal&nbsp;of discipline-specific expertise through these&nbsp;experiences. The university, moreover, has a strong&nbsp;community of faculty DH practitioners and an&nbsp;established tradition of integrating graduate students&nbsp;into projects as collaborators. But as formal DH&nbsp;curricula grew at other institutions, UCLA graduate&nbsp;students and faculty began to feel that a formal&nbsp;credential might be useful to graduates as they entered&nbsp;the job market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even as students clamored for it, the introduction of an official graduate certificate has also had the effect&nbsp;of surfacing some challenges and dilemmas for&nbsp;graduate education in the digital humanities: how&nbsp;much of the graduate curriculum should be formal,&nbsp;and how much should come in the form of project&nbsp;work; how to provide the time- and resource-intensive&nbsp;instruction graduate students require; how to help&nbsp;students balance traditional dissertation work with&nbsp;digital work; how to accommodate the very distinct&nbsp;needs of Ph.D. students and professional master's&nbsp;degree students; and how to prepare graduate&nbsp;students for an unpredictable job market. Alexander</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reid identified many of these dilemmas in a 2012</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">essay for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Debates in the Digital Humanities,</span><span class="font5"> observing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">an uptick in digital humanities activity and arguing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that we would soon witness a widespread shift in the education of scholars, toward an understanding of&nbsp;digital literacy as fundamental to graduate training</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Reid 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the vantage of 2016, the picture seems less clear. Digital humanities continues to thrive as a field,&nbsp;but we have yet to see the searching, widespread&nbsp;reevaluation of graduate education that some&nbsp;observers expected. While a number of standout&nbsp;programs, such as the City University of New York's</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Graduate Center, the University of Virginia's Scholars' Lab, and the University of Victoria's Electronic Textual&nbsp;Cultures Laboratory, have seemed to forecast change&nbsp;on a larger scale, most humanities graduate programs&nbsp;still deal only gingerly, if at all, with digital technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The example of UCLA might help to illuminate some reasons for this very piecemeal rate of change. UCLA's&nbsp;graduate students, like most graduate students, are&nbsp;under enormous pressure and feel pulled in multiple&nbsp;directions by an erratic and whimsical job market.&nbsp;Assailed by advice to publish in top journals on the one&nbsp;hand, and to develop digital skills on the other, they&nbsp;often come to the DH program ready to perform a cost-benefit calculation about how this training will&nbsp;position them on the job market -- not exactly the spirit&nbsp;of embracing failure and creative experimentation that&nbsp;many DH experts advise (Ramsay 2010, Drucker 2009,&nbsp;Sample 2012). Devising a curriculum that makes sense&nbsp;for them in this climate, then, is constantly demanding&nbsp;and resource-intensive. Among the questions UCLA&nbsp;faculty has faced:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Should a digital humanities program for&nbsp;graduate students emphasize collaborative&nbsp;scholarship, as many practitioners advise, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">should students' DH work advance the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">individual dissertation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">What is the program's responsibility toward&nbsp;preserving and archiving student digital&nbsp;work, and particularly digital dissertations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">If a graduate DH program remains&nbsp;interdisciplinary, how can it assemble and&nbsp;retain the necessary core faculty to staff the&nbsp;program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">How can an interdisciplinary program retain&nbsp;a “center of gravity” sufficient to enable&nbsp;graduate students to feel as though they are&nbsp;part of a community?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">How can a graduate DH program&nbsp;communicate its value to students' advisers,&nbsp;many of whom do not engage in digital work&nbsp;themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Given the highly individualized nature of&nbsp;dissertation-level work, how can graduate&nbsp;DH programs provide sufficient resources&nbsp;(staff time and technical assets) to help&nbsp;students advance their research&nbsp;meaningfully?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">How should a graduate program in DH&nbsp;balance the distinct needs of professional&nbsp;master's degree students (in UCLA's case,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MLIS students) with Ph.D. students?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this presentation, I will discuss the ways in which we at UCLA have attempted to develop a graduate&nbsp;curriculum that makes sense for a program that faces&nbsp;challenges familiar to most universities: lack of&nbsp;resources, little centralized support, and overtaxed&nbsp;faculty. I will also raise some questions about the&nbsp;sustainability of a digital humanities graduate&nbsp;curriculum without answering some searching and&nbsp;difficult questions about what a graduate program&nbsp;should be and do. Finally, I will propose some&nbsp;infrastructural and institutional solutions to help&nbsp;address some of the most pressing needs of graduate&nbsp;DH programs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At Bard College, we don't have a formal Digital Humanities center. Instead, we have an&nbsp;interdisciplinary curricular initiative and hub for&nbsp;faculty collaboration that we call Experimental&nbsp;Humanities (EH). DH scholarship at its most visible&nbsp;typically creates and employs digital tools to pursue&nbsp;project-based humanities research. While EH does&nbsp;some of this, our program was designed to align with&nbsp;the mission of our undergraduate-focused institution,&nbsp;and to be flexible enough to bring together faculty&nbsp;from diverse intellectual and personal backgrounds.&nbsp;We say that Experimental Humanities is Bard's liberal&nbsp;arts-driven answer to the Digital Humanities: it uses a&nbsp;network of courses and faculty-identified research&nbsp;clusters to variously interrogate how technology&nbsp;mediates what it means to be human. EH engages with&nbsp;media and technology forms from across historical&nbsp;periods, including our own, and combines&nbsp;experimental research methods with critical thinking&nbsp;about way media and technology function as a part of&nbsp;cultural, social, and political inquiry. We encourage the&nbsp;reconsideration of older media in light of today's&nbsp;technologies, and look ahead to the developments on&nbsp;the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The decision to name our program Experimental Humanities instead of Digital Humanities was&nbsp;grounded in the unique character and history of Bard&nbsp;College, which has developed an international&nbsp;reputation for its commitment to the arts, humanities,&nbsp;and the notion that access to a liberal arts education&nbsp;should be a fundamental human right. Although our&nbsp;primary campus in the Hudson Valley of New York&nbsp;serves just over 2000 students, Bard has a much wider&nbsp;reach that includes degree-granting programs in state&nbsp;prisons, early college programs at high schools that&nbsp;serve low-income youth in cities around the U.S., and&nbsp;in international university partnerships that bring&nbsp;liberal arts curricula to countries such as Kyrgyzstan,&nbsp;Palestine, and Russia. In this context of passionate&nbsp;liberal arts advocacy, we wanted a title that would&nbsp;leave room for DH but not exclude non-digital forms of&nbsp;artistic and scholarly production. As Wendy Chun has&nbsp;suggested, terminology that draws hard lines between&nbsp;“old” and “new” technologies runs the risk of excluding&nbsp;(or at least seeming to exclude) the lessons, theories,&nbsp;and knowledge of the past from the practice and study&nbsp;of “new” media. The notion of the “experimental”&nbsp;embraces both digitality and previous moments of&nbsp;technological change, invokes the practices of both the&nbsp;sciences and the arts, and has the kind of hands-on and&nbsp;countercultural associations that align with the Bard&nbsp;ethos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We saw the rise of DH as an exciting opportunity to establish a program dedicated to reconsidering the&nbsp;methods and subjects of humanistic study in the light&nbsp;of changing material conditions. This is an ongoing&nbsp;project, and one that also allows us to continuously reevaluate our pedagogical approaches: rethinking&nbsp;which tools and methods we use in the classroom and&nbsp;encouraging in-class reflection with our students&nbsp;about the relationships between who we are, what we&nbsp;study, and how we study it. For instance, when faced&nbsp;with N. Katherine Hayles's work on hyper and deep&nbsp;attention, students may put forward arguments for&nbsp;practicing deep attention in their coursework or&nbsp;advocate for a pedagogy that introduces more&nbsp;multimediated and hands-on content, thereby creating&nbsp;the opportunity for jointly designed assignments.&nbsp;Finally, in keeping with the concerns raised by&nbsp;#transformdh (see, for instance, Moya Z. Bailey's essay&nbsp;“All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are&nbsp;Men, but Some of Us Are Brave”) we wanted to keep&nbsp;cultural critique and questions of inclusion central to&nbsp;what we do as humanities scholars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With these ideals in mind, we set out to design a program that would be critical, inclusive,&nbsp;undergraduate-focused, and also able to participate in&nbsp;wider DH networks. In their essay about whether or&nbsp;how small liberal arts colleges might “do” DH, Bryan&nbsp;Alexander and Rebecca Frost Davis outline several&nbsp;challenges to establishing DH programs and centers at&nbsp;institutions like Bard. They note a lack of&nbsp;infrastructure to support major research projects, the&nbsp;difficulty of pulling together the human resources to&nbsp;do work that requires a wide range of skills, our&nbsp;limited access to graduate students that can sustain&nbsp;long-term research, and the pedagogical focus at&nbsp;SLACs. However, they argue that models that include&nbsp;curricular elements and partner with existing campus&nbsp;resources like library and IT can still be successful,&nbsp;developing proficiency in select project areas and&nbsp;sending students on to DH graduate programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experimental Humanities does work closely with Library/IT and encourage faculty projects through&nbsp;training opportunities, the guidance of a Digital&nbsp;Projects Coordinator with a PhD in the humanities, and&nbsp;the support of a student Media Corps. But while&nbsp;several successful DH programs at other small liberal&nbsp;arts colleges have grown out of the library, like&nbsp;Occidental's Center for Digital Liberal Arts, or out of&nbsp;faculty research, as with Hamilton's Digital Humanities&nbsp;Initiative, EH was from its first imaginings a primarily&nbsp;curricular initiative, built on the three pillars of&nbsp;history, theory, and practice. All EH students take the&nbsp;core courses “A History of Experimentation” and&nbsp;“Introduction to Media,” which EH faculty rotate&nbsp;teaching, and at least one practice-based course&nbsp;beyond the college arts requirement (this may include&nbsp;Computer Science or one of the visual, written, or&nbsp;performing arts). Students also take at least two more&nbsp;courses from the wide offering of EH-listed courses&nbsp;designed by faculty according to their research&nbsp;interests, and which are available each semester in&nbsp;fields from Music and Anthropology to Medieval&nbsp;Studies and Theater. These classes present the hands-on projects and research that they do at collective&nbsp;Share Events each semester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At an administrative level, EH is a concentration (like a minor; Bard loves to have its own terminology&nbsp;for everything), which means that our students pair&nbsp;their coursework with a foundation in a major&nbsp;program of study, and that EH faculty also belong to a&nbsp;home program. All Bard students do yearlong senior&nbsp;projects, which allow our students to bring what they&nbsp;have learned in the concentration into conversation&nbsp;with their major discipline in a capstone project. We&nbsp;have seen senior projects that use topic modeling to&nbsp;analyze slave narratives, develop gaming apps with the&nbsp;potential to treat psychopathy, push the boundaries of&nbsp;traditional interview-based ethnography to consider&nbsp;the social implications of conversing via text message,&nbsp;delve into the history of the book and other media&nbsp;forms, and lead to immersive art installations in both&nbsp;digital and analog formats. Our students do not&nbsp;necessarily go into DH programs (though some do),&nbsp;but rather become curators, teachers, librarians,&nbsp;programmers, artists, and work for non-profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This kind of breadth makes Experimental Humanities sustainable even on a small campus,&nbsp;providing a hub for a range of interests and methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile, our regular course and event offerings give the program continuity and create opportunities for&nbsp;faculty and students to meet during the semester as a&nbsp;self-identifying community. We have also worked to&nbsp;bolster faculty research in recent years, beginning&nbsp;with the launch of our faculty-led, topic-based clusters&nbsp;in 2014. The clusters have been very successful in&nbsp;bringing faculty together to share and further their&nbsp;own research across disciplinary boundaries, and have&nbsp;yielded a number of new courses and given rise to a&nbsp;form of experimental symposia that bring together&nbsp;scholars, artists, practitioners, students, and&nbsp;community members around cluster topics such as&nbsp;“Sound” and “Surveillance.” The clusters have become&nbsp;a model in the college for how to foster&nbsp;interdisciplinary collaboration that encourages both&nbsp;new research and student engagement. Other research&nbsp;models in EH include faculty-led humanities labs&nbsp;around individual projects, intensive student sessions&nbsp;with historical societies to create digital repositories&nbsp;and interfaces for the public to access its local history,&nbsp;and courses with embedded digital projects that allow&nbsp;faculty to work with undergraduates to build up layers&nbsp;of data each time that they teach the course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">EH is now in its fifth year, and coming to the end of a three-year grant from the Mellon Foundation. In my&nbsp;presentation I will discuss several of the challenges&nbsp;that we face at this crucial stage of transition. These&nbsp;include the ongoing struggle to define what we do and&nbsp;why it's useful to students, parents, and future&nbsp;employers, given our capacious title and mission; how&nbsp;to practically negotiate the need for disciplinary&nbsp;foundations in our students' and faculty's home&nbsp;programs and the invitation to experiment in EH&nbsp;courses and projects; how to move off of a major grant&nbsp;to become sustainable within the existing college&nbsp;structure (and thereby resist the kind of dependence&nbsp;on external grants that is contributing to the&nbsp;neoliberalization of the humanities, as outlined in the&nbsp;widely circulated “Dark Side of the Digital Humanities”&nbsp;papers); and how to better integrate the wider Bard&nbsp;network of underserved high school and&nbsp;undergraduate students both in the US and around the&nbsp;world into the work that we do.</span></p>
