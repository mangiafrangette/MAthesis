<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Getting Medieval: The Many Middle Ages</span><span class="font1"> is an undergraduate course, a digitally-inflected introduction to the global Middle Ages. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Getting Medieval</span><span class="font1"> functions&nbsp;as an experiment in networked pedagogy, drawing on&nbsp;the expertise of faculty researchers, curators, and digital scholarship specialists. Students read medieval&nbsp;texts, handle related medieval artifacts from the University's special collections, and curate digital collections and exhibits that bring together texts, artifacts,&nbsp;and digital repositories from around the world. Students also attend biweekly guest lectures by faculty researchers and cultural heritage professionals. Our&nbsp;course is predicated on open access--to a wider Middle&nbsp;Ages than the traditional western European canon reveals; to open-source, open-access platforms for public scholarship and digital collections; to a technical infrastructure open to members of the university community; and to the fragile artifacts of the medieval past&nbsp;from the vaults of local cultural heritage institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We conceived the course as a series of moments in time and space, moments defined by literary texts and&nbsp;related physical objects—when possible, objects from&nbsp;the University of Toronto's Malcove Collection, which&nbsp;students can visit in person. For example, the unit on&nbsp;Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales invited students&nbsp;into fourteenth-century England, along the road from&nbsp;London to Canterbury. Students learned about medieval pilgrimage and religious practices around relics.&nbsp;In this context, they encountered Chaucer's pilgrims—&nbsp;and especially the false-relic-peddling Pardoner. And&nbsp;in this context, too, they touched and handled a&nbsp;twelfth-century French reliquary from the University&nbsp;of Toronto's Art Centre. The course focuses on a wide&nbsp;variety of times, places, and literary texts, beyond the&nbsp;traditional western European focus of Medieval Studies: from eighth century Anglo-Saxon England and the&nbsp;Old English </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beowulf</span><span class="font1"> to tenth century medieval Spain&nbsp;and the interweaving of Jewish, Muslim, and Christian&nbsp;theological and poetic traditions in the region of AlAndalus; from the eleventh-century Japanese imperial&nbsp;court and Murasaki Shikibu's courtly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tale of Genji</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman court and the lays&nbsp;of Marie de France; from the cultural crossroads of the&nbsp;Ethiopian capital of Axum in the thirteenth century to&nbsp;the cultural crossroads of the French capital of Paris in&nbsp;the fourteenth; from the East-West journeys of Asian,&nbsp;Middle-Eastern, and European travelers along the Silk&nbsp;Road, to the journey of Geoffrey Chaucer's pilgrims&nbsp;from London to Canterbury. To do these varied traditions justice, we invited guest speakers to introduce&nbsp;their research. In one class, students listened to an Old&nbsp;English lexicographer talk about linguistic archaeology at the Dictionary of Old English. In another, they&nbsp;learned about a digital collection of medieval Tibetan&nbsp;letters, and they turned the pages of a twentieth-century Tibetan book which maintains medieval book&nbsp;forms. In yet another, students experienced a lecture&nbsp;that turned into a performance of medieval drama.&nbsp;The lectures provide access not only to the usual undergraduate curriculum, but to a range of faculty-led&nbsp;research projects that showcase the range of Medieval&nbsp;Studies at Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The digital inflection of the course is twofold. First, students examine how the times, places, texts, and&nbsp;things we study are represented in digital projects and&nbsp;repositories, from the Dictionary of Old English to the&nbsp;International Dunhuang Project. Second, students are&nbsp;invited to create public-facing scholarship themselves:&nbsp;After they visit the secure storage spaces of the Mal-cove Collection and receive the curator's guidance on&nbsp;the care, handling, and cultural context of artifacts,&nbsp;students handle medieval artifacts; study them in the&nbsp;context of our local collection and of digital repositories around the world; and produce a public, curated&nbsp;digital collection and exhibit, linking the artifact to the&nbsp;course's thematics, in the open-source content management platform Omeka. In so doing, students practice close reading and slow looking, examining an object in cultural and literary contexts. They also learn&nbsp;about digital collections—from the digitization of materials to data curation and digital preservation—and&nbsp;about scholarly communication possibilities in the&nbsp;digital age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We designed our digital assignments with access in mind. The students' initial contact with the secure</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">vaults of the Malcove Collection offered hands-on, immediate, physical access to the artifacts—and included a discussion on the kinds of information such access&nbsp;provides, information unavailable in a digital medium.&nbsp;The software platform Omeka itself is free, opensource, with significant traction in DH pedagogy. Our&nbsp;hosted Omeka instances allow students to complete&nbsp;the work even if they only have access to public university computers. Our tutorials guide students&nbsp;through the work in interactive workshops conducted&nbsp;in university computer laboratories, ensuring that students without a laptop, or without prior technical experience, are able to complete their work in a supportive environment, with help close at hand. But this level&nbsp;of access requires significant logistical work and infrastructure. Students have access to faculty research&nbsp;projects thanks to the Centre for Medieval Studies' network of scholars. Students are able to use university&nbsp;laboratories because we make arrangements in collaboration with digital scholarship librarians to provide&nbsp;access to this portion of UofToronto's computing infrastructure. Students are able to experience relevant artifacts from the Malcove collection so closely because&nbsp;of a course-long collaboration between its Collections</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Thus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Getting Medieval</span><span class="font1"> functions as an experiment in networked pedagogy. Biweekly guest lectures, robustly integrated into the curriculum, invite a network&nbsp;of faculty researchers and cultural heritage professionals into the undergraduate classroom; and the&nbsp;open access requirements of our digital projects draw&nbsp;on the institution's physical and human infrastruc-ture—from special collections of medieval objects to&nbsp;computing facilities; from curators to medievalists to&nbsp;digital scholarship specialists. As we invite our students on a time-travelling journey across the global&nbsp;Middle Ages, we rely on a network of guides to open&nbsp;points of access along the way.</span></p>
