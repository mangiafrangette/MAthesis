<p><span class="font2">MoEML’s gazetteer of 6500 London place name variants invites the mapping of datasets with a&nbsp;geographical component. As a textual editing project&nbsp;with an interest in print culture, we have long hoped&nbsp;to mobilize our GIS tools and gazetteer data in the&nbsp;service of mapping the English book trade. Our&nbsp;ultimate goal is to publish a layer showing the printing&nbsp;and/or retailing locations of the approximately 25,000&nbsp;books printed in London between 1475 and 1640.&nbsp;Imprint lines in early modern books include highly&nbsp;granular location data, which has meant that book&nbsp;history has traditionally had an implicit geospatial&nbsp;dimension. A typical imprint line tells us that copies of&nbsp;a folio are “Printed by Elizabeth Purslovv, and are to&nbsp;be sold by Nicholas Bourne, at his shop at the south&nbsp;entrance of the Royall Exchange, 1633.” Using the&nbsp;information in such imprint lines, Kathleen Pantzer&nbsp;reorganized the items in the Short Title Catalogue&nbsp;under location headings (Pantzer numbers) in Vol. 3 of&nbsp;the catalogue. Her work facilitates questions about the&nbsp;proximity of one printer or bookseller to another, and&nbsp;thereby questions about affiliations, collaborations,&nbsp;and specialization among a key group of early modern&nbsp;cultural agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, considerable processing of Pantzer’s printed lists is required to visualize or map STC items.&nbsp;Thus far, digital databases like </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Early English Books&nbsp;Online</span><span class="font2"> (EEBO) and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">English Short Title Catalogue&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(ESTC) have captured the imprint line without parsing&nbsp;it into discrete data points, thereby leaving Pantzer’s&nbsp;formidable interpretive work behind as we move into&nbsp;the era of digital historical bibliography. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Database&nbsp;of Early English Playbooks</span><span class="font2"> (DEEP) has included and&nbsp;corrected Pantzer numbers, but only for the printed&nbsp;plays, of course. MoEML has attempted to replicate&nbsp;Pantzer’s work via datamining the ESTC. After several&nbsp;unsuccessful NER experiments on ESTC data, we are&nbsp;now mobilizing the curatorial work of DEEP and&nbsp;planning to extend their work beyond playbooks. In&nbsp;this paper, we take imprint lines and geospatial&nbsp;information about the book trade as a case study in&nbsp;mining carefully curated data. We explain the long&nbsp;history of this project as it extends back to Pantzer’s&nbsp;own work creating the strict vocabulary for the print&nbsp;locations of early modern texts. We then discuss how&nbsp;MoEML has been able to put the STC data onto the&nbsp;Agas map, giving a better sense of the spatial&nbsp;relationship of printed early modern texts. In doing so,&nbsp;our argument centers on the necessity for authority&nbsp;names and strict vocabularies. Invoking Mike Poston’s&nbsp;suggestion that we cannot predict the uses of our data,&nbsp;we use our own work on various print and digital&nbsp;databases to show how we can control and scaffold the&nbsp;mining processes to establish links between several&nbsp;pairs of projects in order to mine and ingest data from&nbsp;databases that do not share a common data field with&nbsp;the initial project in the sequence. We conclude with a&nbsp;list of considerations and principles for maximizing&nbsp;future interoperability between literary datasets.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although not strictly based in MySQL technology, our methodology borrows from the work of digital&nbsp;humanists like Harvey Quamen and Jon Bath who use&nbsp;MySQL to design relational databases. Indeed, in order&nbsp;to establish valuable connections across diverse&nbsp;datasets, we must first identify what data points these&nbsp;datasets have in common (either directly or&nbsp;indirectly). For example, suppose that Dataset 1&nbsp;contains raw data for categories A, B, and C and&nbsp;Database 2 contains raw data for categories X, Y, and&nbsp;C. By identifying common data points in category C&nbsp;between databases 1 and 2, it becomes possible to&nbsp;make further connections among categories A, B, X,&nbsp;and Y. From here, we could identify common data&nbsp;points in a third database that contains raw data for&nbsp;categories E, F, and X. We believe that relational&nbsp;databases provide the best platform to capture this&nbsp;“web of relations” in big data. Quamen and Bath&nbsp;describe relational databases as “a series of&nbsp;interconnected spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet-called a table in database lingo—contains information&nbsp;on a real world entity such as People or Books or Songs&nbsp;or Birds or Rock Concerts or Places. Those tables are&nbsp;then tied together via relationships” (Quamen and&nbsp;Bath, 2016; 146-147). By providing a set of stepping&nbsp;stones or crosswalks between diverse datasets,&nbsp;relational databases enable us to build links between&nbsp;allied projects (i.e., ones that share a common data&nbsp;point) and more remote projects (i.e., ones that do not&nbsp;share a common data point) in order to combine&nbsp;expertise and mobilize already curated data in new&nbsp;environments.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Past Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In 2014, MoEML research assistant Tye Landels-Gruenewald undertook a directed study course with director Janelle Jenstad with the aim of geocoding the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">English Short Title Catalogue</span><span class="font2"> (ESTC) from 1475&nbsp;through 1666. With the generous assistance of David&nbsp;Eichmann and Blaine Greteman of the Shakeosphere&nbsp;project (based at the University of Iowa), we were able&nbsp;to extract toponyms from transcribed imprints in the&nbsp;ESTC catalogue using natural language processing&nbsp;(NLP) technology. We had intended on using named&nbsp;entity recognition to find matches between the&nbsp;extracted ESTC toponyms and our own gazetteer of&nbsp;early modern London locations; however, the&nbsp;toponyms themselves included too many errors or&nbsp;extra text to make this feasible. As Grover, Givon,&nbsp;Tobin, and Ball note in their white paper on “Named&nbsp;Entity Recognition for Digitised Historical Texts,”&nbsp;there is still much work be done in order to teach&nbsp;named entity recognition software to recognize early&nbsp;modern English (Grover et al., 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Concomitantly, Jenstad was manually compiling a spreadsheet of Pantzer numbers and cross-referencing them to MoEML location identifiers.&nbsp;Pantzer numbers are an alphanumeric string&nbsp;consisting of a letter and an integer. The letter&nbsp;indicates a general location. All the Pantzer numbers&nbsp;beginning with the letter O indicate locations in, near,&nbsp;or “against” the Royal Exchange. The numbers offer&nbsp;more granularity. For example, O.2 designates a&nbsp;location “at the north side of the Royal Exchange.” Key&nbsp;challenges in matching Pantzer numbers with MoEML&nbsp;IDs were (1) different controlled vocabularies, and (2)&nbsp;the different levels of granularity inherent in the&nbsp;projects. Pantzer’s authority names came from the&nbsp;imprint line wording; MoEML authority names are&nbsp;standardized spellings of the official or most common&nbsp;toponym variant (determined by set of critical rules&nbsp;we codified in order to build our gazetteer).&nbsp;Granularity differences emerged from the different&nbsp;interests of the two projects. Book historians map the&nbsp;bookstalls in the Royal Exchange, a location for which&nbsp;MoEML considered as a single entity (ROYA1); MoEML&nbsp;finer granularity emerges elsewhere, in our mapping&nbsp;of conduits, landings, and the many other precise&nbsp;locations that John Stow mentions in his Survey of&nbsp;London. A full crosswalk between Pantzer and MoEML&nbsp;would require the addition of sublocations to&nbsp;MoEML’s placeography, a goal we will likely realize via&nbsp;the development of MoEML microsites for the Royal&nbsp;Exchange and Paul’s Churchyard. In the meantime, we&nbsp;lose some of the granularity of Pantzer’s data by&nbsp;assigning the same MoEML id to two or more Pantzer&nbsp;numbers.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Current Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">These &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past-attempts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at establishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">interoperability between datasets illustrate the challenges in attempting to traverse projects that only&nbsp;weakly share common data points. Between MoEML&nbsp;and the ESTC are a number of assumptions, potential&nbsp;errors, and remediations that weaken the link&nbsp;between the two respective datasets. To get to our&nbsp;larger project of mapping the STC, we must take&nbsp;smaller steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our current work relates the playbook data collected by Zachary Lesser and Alan B. Farmer at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Database of Early English Playbooks</span><span class="font2"> (DEEP) to our own&nbsp;toponymic data, relying on Pantzer’s vocabulary as a&nbsp;shared data-point. Jenstad’s spreadsheet was&nbsp;transformed into a TEI-conformant XML table, which&nbsp;we ran across DEEP’s openly available XML data.&nbsp;Doing so allows us to integrate DEEP numbers into the&nbsp;site, linking outwards to DEEP’s newly static and&nbsp;predictable URLs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The DEEP data and Pantzer-MoEML table can be related, but we recognize that this relationship is not&nbsp;immutable. In other words, both datasets are “living”&nbsp;databases insofar as the data can—and should be—&nbsp;curated and edited. Once Jenstad’s spreadsheet was&nbsp;converted into TEI, Landels-Gruenewald was tasked&nbsp;with editing and refining Jenstad’s initial findings to&nbsp;reflect the the growth of MoEML’s gazetteer over the&nbsp;past two years (the MoEML team tagged nearly 2000&nbsp;more toponyms between July 25, 2014- the last day&nbsp;Jenstad worked on the spreadsheet- and October 31,&nbsp;2016, from 11,259 to 16,120). Lesser and Farmer have&nbsp;also recognized the need to amend Pantzer’s findings&nbsp;in their data.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Future Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The experiment with DEEP data has given us a stronger link to the ESTC. Now that we know Pantzer&nbsp;numbers are relatable to MoEML toponym IDs, we can&nbsp;now mobilize the data from Pantzer’s appendix to&nbsp;connect MoEML with the ESTC. We plan to convert&nbsp;Pantzer’s printed aggregations of STC numbers to&nbsp;digital files via OCR. With some curation, we will then&nbsp;have a list of all the STC numbers at each Pantzer&nbsp;number; using our crosswalk between Pantzer&nbsp;numbers and MoEML IDs, we will have a list of STC&nbsp;numbers (and therefore of unique print editions and&nbsp;issues) associated with MoEML locations. From the&nbsp;ESTC, we can obtain a crosswalk relating STC numbers&nbsp;to ESTC numbers. We add the caveat that Pantzer’s&nbsp;locations will need to be corrected as book historians&nbsp;like Lesser and Farmer bring their knowledge to bear&nbsp;on her interpretation of STC data; every crosswalk&nbsp;dependent on her data will need to be refreshed and&nbsp;all the data maps remade. We can display these STC&nbsp;numbers as lists on MoEML location pages, much as&nbsp;Pantzer’s print database does; in the digital&nbsp;environment, we can make dynamic links to DEEP or&nbsp;ESTC open-access pages for the book. We can also map&nbsp;these numbers on our open-layers Agas map platform&nbsp;as a layer of imprints associated with locations,&nbsp;eventually in combination with other tags (such as&nbsp;genre, now being added to EEBO by other scholars) or&nbsp;with other metadata fields harvested from the ESTC.&nbsp;All this data will pivot on the STC-MoEML data&nbsp;crosswalk that we are producing via Pantzer,&nbsp;following DEEP’s initial work.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Distant Future Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A longer-term goal is to harvest from the ESTC’s XML files the strings of characters transcribed in the&nbsp;imprint line metadata field. Since we will already&nbsp;know from the STC-MoEML crosswalk which location&nbsp;is described in the imprint line, we can sort the imprint&nbsp;lines by locations and do rapid human scans for&nbsp;outliers, which may be a quick way of correcting&nbsp;Pantzer’s data. We can also wrap TEI tags around the&nbsp;toponyms in the imprint lines, thereby increasing the&nbsp;number of toponymic variants in the MoEML&nbsp;gazetteer. The more variants in the gazetteer, the more&nbsp;accurate any future NER or geoparsing of large&nbsp;corpora will be. Given that we already search the&nbsp;EEBO-TCP corpus manually for references to place, we&nbsp;aspire to run our gazetteer against the entire TCP&nbsp;corpus to find and then map toponyms.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Principles and Practices of Curation for Future Mining and Interoperability</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Acknowledging that the most interesting future uses of a project’s data have not yet been imagined&nbsp;(Poston, 2011), how can we maximize the&nbsp;opportunities for other people to do things with that&nbsp;data? We suggest the following principles and&nbsp;practices as a starting point for discussion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make your data free to the world, preferably&nbsp;in easily downloadable and manipulable&nbsp;formats (in .json or .xml files, for example).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be clear about how you compiled your data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are aware of limitations in your data,&nbsp;tell the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you correct and refine your data,&nbsp;communicate regularly about data updates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using other people’s data in your&nbsp;own applications, check back regularly and&nbsp;rebuild the data crosswalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know the weak link(s) in your data&nbsp;crosswalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan for corrections as other projects&nbsp;improve their data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be mindful of the potential for error to&nbsp;compound. Errors in my data, combined&nbsp;with errors in your data, have the potential&nbsp;to lead scholars to false conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test your data crosswalks in a variety of&nbsp;ways. Take a small subset of the data and&nbsp;compare NLP results to hand curated results,&nbsp;for example.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Pantzer died in 2005, the year before MoEML was published at a public URL, but we like to think that she&nbsp;would have welcome the digital recreation, correction,&nbsp;curation, and connection of her data. She used the&nbsp;capacities of print to create a map and dense crossreferences. Having “o’erleapt” Pantzer’s curatorial&nbsp;work in building our digital catalogues, we now need&nbsp;to capture her formidable scholarship of interpreting&nbsp;and relating disparate types of data. We began with the&nbsp;goal of relating MoEML toponyms to ESTC numbers,&nbsp;but discovered that Pantzer’s hand-curated data was&nbsp;more reliable than the results of NER and NLP. Our&nbsp;new question then became: “What sort of steps,&nbsp;processes, principles, and practices are necessary in&nbsp;doing this sort of work?” Handcrafted data, in&nbsp;conjunction with computer processing, allows for&nbsp;greater interoperability between projects and begins&nbsp;to achieve the possibilities of the data not conceived by&nbsp;Pantzer.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
