<p><span class="font3">The poster will focus on the Panorama Toolkit built</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">by the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond (DSLUR) and Stamen Design. The first section will outline the capabilities of the toolkit then turn&nbsp;to examples from DSLUR's American Panorama project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The focus of the toolkit is on the richly dynamic capabilities of modern web maps to enable deep digital scholarship on American History. The components are&nbsp;built on the foundation of open source tools including&nbsp;React and Leaflet libraries -- creating an extensible,&nbsp;public, collaborative framework that will support the&nbsp;continued development of future maps in our Atlas or&nbsp;the user's maps of choice. The components within can&nbsp;be installed via npm and integrated into any web-facing project. American Panorama also includes a template that can be used as a starting point for maps in&nbsp;the American Panorama Atlas, or for other projects&nbsp;that aim to use Panorama components. All of the components are &quot;views&quot; (meaning they appear in the&nbsp;DOM) and use React.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since it is open-source, people can contribute and add new components that can be used individually, or&nbsp;wired together to create dynamic visualizations. The&nbsp;flexibility of the toolkit allows for a range of complexity, which has been seen in the five maps currently&nbsp;available. We envision this being used not only in academia, but in other projects varying in subject and purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To highlight the possibilities of the toolkit, we will focus on University of Richmond's American Panorama, a series of online maps that use interactive mapping features and innovative cartographic design to&nbsp;encourage active investigation of American History.&nbsp;For over a year, the DSLUR has been working with Stamen Design to investigate spatial exploration across&nbsp;various subjects in 19th and 20th century U.S. history.&nbsp;These maps—which make up the Atlas—cover a wide&nbsp;range of topics designed to communicate knowledge&nbsp;about some facet of American history to audiences that&nbsp;include students, scholars, and the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 2015, Stamen and the DSLUR collaborated on the first four maps of the Atlas. The first map covers the&nbsp;forced migration of enslaved people before the Civil&nbsp;War, highlighting the change in net importation and&nbsp;exportation of slaves to and from different parts of the&nbsp;South for each decade between 1810-1860. The migration across the Overland Trails to the West focuses on&nbsp;the routes emigrants took envisioned through the&nbsp;writings in their journals, along with the locations of&nbsp;forts, ferries, and bridges. The movement of people&nbsp;and goods through canals highlights not only the location of canals, but visualizes the goods that moved&nbsp;along them. The immigration of people to the U.S. from&nbsp;1850 to today shows Foreign-Born populations at various scales from country level to county level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The collaboration between Stamen and DSLUR was the key driver to the success of the first four maps. We&nbsp;combined the knowledge and narrative ideas of&nbsp;DSLUR and the visualization skills of Stamen to translate new knowledge into inviting, elegant displays that&nbsp;respect the complexity of the subjects. American Panorama combined two deeply passionate teams to create not just four deeply engaging maps, but also a&nbsp;toolkit of reusable visualization components that&nbsp;could be used for future atlases in the American Panorama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 2016, DSLUR employed the Panorama toolkit to build the fifth map in the American Panorama series, a&nbsp;visualization of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation&nbsp;(HOLC) redlining maps from the early 20th Century.&nbsp;Using the visualization tools developed by Stamen,&nbsp;DSLUR created Mapping Inequality, which updates the&nbsp;study of New Deal America, the federal government,&nbsp;housing, and inequality with twenty-first century tools&nbsp;and scholarship. It offers unprecedented online access&nbsp;to the United States government's collection of &quot;security maps&quot; and area descriptions produced between&nbsp;1935 and 1940. The toolkit allowed the use of cartographic visualizations like concentric circles, which arguably were the spatial episteme of cities for early&nbsp;twentieth-century Americans. These Concentric circle&nbsp;diagrams visualize the relative distribution of HOLC&nbsp;grades in relation to the center of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The toolkit's capabilities are seen in the fifth Atlas map, Mapping Inequality. The foundational components, as well as the flexibility of the software, allowed&nbsp;DSLUR to create an engaging, invoking map highlighting the practice of denying access to mortgages and&nbsp;other forms of credit to neighborhoods based upon&nbsp;discriminatory practices, which later became known&nbsp;as redlining. This last installment of the Atlas showcased that this can be used by anyone wanting to create a project using the capabilities of modern web&nbsp;mapping seen in American Panorama.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Screenshots</span></h2><img src="253_files/253-1.jpg" style="width:232pt;height:113pt;"/>
