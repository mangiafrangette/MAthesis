<p><span class="font3">The ability to create and deploy networking technologies able to deliver relevant content over&nbsp;multiple platforms has until very recently depended&nbsp;on access to costly technology, infrastructure and&nbsp;expertise. The result has been a digital divide that is&nbsp;particularly acute in highly unequal economic contexts&nbsp;like South Africa. The potential of ICT to democratize&nbsp;the public realm, currently dominated by large media&nbsp;houses catering to individuals with the economic&nbsp;means to access costly data services, has not been&nbsp;realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The increased availability of cheap, open-source technologies, along with the growth of communities of&nbsp;users around these technologies, has made possible&nbsp;new kinds of digital publics beyond the&nbsp;abovementioned constraints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Drawing on these technologies we have developed a freestanding platform capable of empowering users&nbsp;to create, publish and access their own network-dependent projects. We have done this using a solar-powered single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) and&nbsp;have tested its application in two projects: a site-specific digital literature project; and a virtual site-specific museum of apartheid-era forced removals.&nbsp;Both are based in the city of Potchefstroom in South&nbsp;Africa’s North West Province.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Site-specific digital literature project</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Site-specific digital literature, by allowing users to access place-bound, multimodal digital literature via&nbsp;mobile devices, opens doors for creative expression,&nbsp;place making as well as experiencing traditional texts&nbsp;in a new way. It can also contribute to a better&nbsp;understanding of the relationship between digital&nbsp;interfaces, spatiality and people and empower people&nbsp;in terms of what is called place-making practices&nbsp;(Kaye, 2000:203; Turner &amp; Davenport, 217-220).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Byderhand</span><span class="font3"> (Byderhand.net, 2016), is a site-specific digital literature project launched during the 2015&nbsp;Aardklop National Arts Festival in Potchefstroom,&nbsp;South Africa. Users accessed multimodal texts on their&nbsp;mobile devices through QR-codes deployed around&nbsp;various sites at the North-West University. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Byderhand&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">was awarded the Aartvark prize for a ground breaking&nbsp;production, and the team was approached to host&nbsp;similar productions elsewhere. In 2016 the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Byderhand</span><span class="font3">-project and platform were used in various&nbsp;educational contexts. Most recently, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Byderhand-</span><span class="font3">team, assisted 1st additional language (Afrikaans)&nbsp;learners at a Potchefstroom secondary school to&nbsp;publish their own site-specific digital literature on the&nbsp;school grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although there is a demand for expansion of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Byderhand</span><span class="font3">-project, cost and scalability are limiting&nbsp;factors. First, in its current form, implementing the&nbsp;project requires a team of dedicated members. is&nbsp;Second, functionality depends on the provision,&nbsp;maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure such as&nbsp;servers and physical QR-codes. On the user end,&nbsp;mobile data cost is a constraining factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, we explored the design of the infrastructure for an automated platform that could&nbsp;empower a low-skilled user, to create, publish and&nbsp;access their own projects. This was important as&nbsp;usability of a platform can ether promote access or&nbsp;restrict it through the way the interface is developed&nbsp;(Shneiderman, B. 2003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The infrastructure chosen was a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) and a platform was&nbsp;developed based on open standards.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Virtual museum project</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">South Africa’s heritage landscape remains largely skewed in ways that exclude intangible heritage such&nbsp;as stories and memories of such events as apartheid-era forced removals. A virtual museum of forced&nbsp;removals aids in remedying this by offering an in situ&nbsp;space where people can give voice to their experience&nbsp;and preserve it for future generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The city of Potchefstroom was one of the first places where forced removals took place during the&nbsp;apartheid regime but little historical records exist&nbsp;outside oral accounts and some pictures of what took&nbsp;place. The platform we developed provides access for&nbsp;a community to tell their own story without the need&nbsp;for expensive infrastructure. It can provide a place for&nbsp;reconciliation, healing and understanding the&nbsp;intricacies of racial tensions within the context of a&nbsp;specific community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In summary our paper reports on prototyping a cheap, scalable system, independent of electricity and&nbsp;data costs that can allow users to add and access&nbsp;content for both these projects. In particular, the&nbsp;paper considers the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the prototype platform enables users to&nbsp;publish multimodal texts and multimedia&nbsp;(e.g. audio, images and video) on their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the prototype platform provides an&nbsp;easy way to consume published work using&nbsp;entry-level smartphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scalability of this cultural infrastructure,&nbsp;with regard to expanding multimodal site-specific literature and museums along with&nbsp;the creation of site-specific corpora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational applications:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the platform could be ported into&nbsp;other applications such as freestanding,&nbsp;free-access libraries for schools and&nbsp;community centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational possibilities created that can&nbsp;introduce students to the world of digital&nbsp;literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lesson in the value of interdisciplinary&nbsp;collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building collaborative communities and&nbsp;empowering them to tell their own stories.</span></p>
