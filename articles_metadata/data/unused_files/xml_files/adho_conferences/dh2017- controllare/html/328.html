<p><span class="font1">This paper presents a project, currently underway, that combines 3D fabrication and digital audio&nbsp;processing with text mining and sentiment analysis to&nbsp;gauge attitudes toward digital fabrication processes&nbsp;(and maker culture more generally) among a large&nbsp;online community of musicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the last two years, traditional musical instrument manufacturing materials have been joined&nbsp;by laser-sintered plastics and photopolymer resins, as&nbsp;new Additive Manufacturing techniques have been&nbsp;employed either to replicate vintage instrument parts,&nbsp;or redesign them altogether. In no case, however, have&nbsp;digital fabrication methods managed to entirely&nbsp;displace artisanal tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This study explores how digital fabrication has been negotiated by one large and active online&nbsp;musician’s community that values artistry, craft, and&nbsp;industrial history alike. Using low-end desktop 3D&nbsp;fabrication methods with open-source software, I am&nbsp;reproducing a line of replica instrument parts based&nbsp;on vintage originals. Once all reproductions are&nbsp;complete, I plan to engage a professional musician to&nbsp;test-play the printed replicas, and compare them with&nbsp;their original vintage models. These tests will be&nbsp;recorded using audio freeware, and shared with&nbsp;members of a select online musician’s community, in&nbsp;order to determine whether they distinguish my 3D-prints from their original models.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My aim is less to determine whether these replicas are in fact morphologically and sonically identical to&nbsp;their period models than to determine how 3D digital&nbsp;fabrication is received by musicians strongly devoted&nbsp;to vintage equipment and artisanal craft. Using the&nbsp;Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK 3.0) with a&nbsp;naïve Bayes classifier trained on a valenced wordlist&nbsp;(e.g. AFINN), I will conduct sentiment analyses of the&nbsp;online forum to gauge how the community of&nbsp;musicians responds to the introduction of new&nbsp;manufacturing techniques that are neither industrial&nbsp;nor conventionally artisanal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ultimately, this project addresses the “emergence” of digital humanities (Jones 2013) into artisanal&nbsp;practices as a sign of our contemporary “post-digital”&nbsp;condition, under which we need “no longer talk about&nbsp;digital versus analog but instead about modulations of&nbsp;the digital or different intensities of the&nbsp;computational” (Berry 2014). By engaging one active&nbsp;and prominent community of analog musicians in a&nbsp;discussion of digital fabrication, I hope to use their&nbsp;insights into the materiality of music production to&nbsp;address questions crucial to maker epistemology, such&nbsp;as: “For which methodologies do tactility and texture&nbsp;especially matter?,” and “When is scholarly&nbsp;communication most persuasive off the screen?”&nbsp;(Sayers 2015).</span></p>
