<p><span class="font3">This paper discusses the importance of physical spaces, as a source of context, with relation to&nbsp;electronic resources. The presented arguments are&nbsp;based on a geo-located mobile application (due for&nbsp;launch in November 2016) developed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the Letters&nbsp;of 1916</span><span class="font3"> project that allows users to see letters from the&nbsp;collection near them. The application is available for&nbsp;the Android platform and allows users to read letters&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Letters of 1916</span><span class="font3"> based on the device’s&nbsp;geolocation providing a different way to engage with&nbsp;the resource. While the abstract considers a wider&nbsp;perspective, the presented paper will focus more on&nbsp;the implementation of the application and the means&nbsp;of access it provides.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Context</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Letters of 1916</span><span class="font3"> is Ireland’s first public engagement, digital humanities project. It collects,&nbsp;digitises, transcribes, encodes, and makes available&nbsp;through its electronic platform epistolary documents&nbsp;written about Ireland between 1 November 1915 and&nbsp;31 October 1916. The goal of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Letters of 1916</span><span class="font3"> is to&nbsp;reassess the narrative of this period through the&nbsp;collection of letters (including postcards and&nbsp;telegrams) with a tangible link to Ireland. The year&nbsp;1916 was one of transition for Ireland: between its&nbsp;involvement in the Great War and the rise of militant&nbsp;nationalism, the country was divided by sentiment,&nbsp;separated by ideals. The rhetoric of the letter presents&nbsp;personal perspectives and individual memory traces;&nbsp;the collected letters provide an insight into those&nbsp;fragmentary stories that, inspected together,&nbsp;constitute a collective consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the project uses its </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Explore database</span><span class="font3"> to provide a traditional interface (including search and&nbsp;browse functions as well as the ability to view the&nbsp;letters sorted by location, topic, institution, and&nbsp;author’s gender, etc.) to engage with the collection,&nbsp;the mobile application is limited to discovery through&nbsp;geo-location. The motivation behind such an&nbsp;application is to provide a different way to engage with&nbsp;the resource through a dynamic-content interface.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a project born out of humanities research, it is important to ground the mobile application within a&nbsp;framework that provides clarity about its function and&nbsp;design. The application addresses questions of access&nbsp;and investigates the following three key areas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Re-inserting space</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Archival objects are decontextualised artefacts that are removed from their place of origin and collected&nbsp;within resources outside their purpose and&nbsp;provenance. The importance of providing&nbsp;geographical positions to objects within collections,&nbsp;both as means of providing access and as a method of&nbsp;context-attribution, has been discussed broadly&nbsp;(Harekama 2012; Cusworth et. al. 2015). Mapping&nbsp;objects to digital maps is a common practice in&nbsp;collection building and may be seen in projects like&nbsp;Mapping the Republic of Letters or Photogrammar, for&nbsp;instance. The objects in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Letters of 1916</span><span class="font3"> collection&nbsp;are written between individuals within a historic&nbsp;context and a spatial context. Letters are spatially-aware objects — written from a place and to a place;&nbsp;their understanding is deeply grounded within the&nbsp;geographical spaces they occupy. It is, then, obvious&nbsp;that their experience should be enhanced by providing&nbsp;them with geo-locations. The mobile application&nbsp;presents these letters within the spaces they are&nbsp;created or written to; the experience of reading a letter&nbsp;standing on the same street as it was composed is&nbsp;different to reading it on a screen detached from its&nbsp;physical space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Serendipity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Collections are only as good as the access they provide. Most digital collections provide access&nbsp;through text-searches, which, at some level, always&nbsp;assume that the user knows what she is looking for.&nbsp;Even with faceted searches, the sense of discovery is&nbsp;limited by a prior knowledge of the collection. A geo-located retrieval of content is not mediated by textual&nbsp;input but through the user’s own existence in physical&nbsp;space. That tangible sense of discovery, or rather, that&nbsp;serendipitous moment of coming across a piece of&nbsp;history is mediated, not by some prior knowledge of&nbsp;the collection, but as a consequence of the user’s&nbsp;location in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aura, magic, and history</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stanley Cavell (1979), while discussing photographs, tries to find the relationship between the&nbsp;subject and the image of the subject. His exploration&nbsp;attempts to address that connection between the&nbsp;physical object and its representation; he explores&nbsp;ideas of aura (Benjamin 1969), magic (Barthes 1977),&nbsp;and history (Tagg 1988) to think about the experience&nbsp;of seeing the physical object and the impression of it;&nbsp;while he identifies that there is a differences, he&nbsp;struggles to describe quite what that is. Building on&nbsp;this line of inquiry, I would like to argue that reading a&nbsp;letter within the space it is conceived or received&nbsp;provides a mode of perception that cannot be found if&nbsp;it is read outside of it. Whether we choose to call that&nbsp;aura, magic, or history, the importance of connecting&nbsp;the object to its physical space lends a multi-sensory&nbsp;engagement that is lacking in other forms of digital&nbsp;interfaces.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Implementation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">This mobile application is designed with input from two rounds of internal user testing and feedback in&nbsp;2016. A focus-group is planned for summer 2017 to&nbsp;further test and enhance the user experience from&nbsp;both software and conceptual perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Letters of 1916</span><span class="font3"> has multiple moving parts and the application is designed and conceived within that&nbsp;existing framework. The project invites the public to&nbsp;transcribe and encode images of the collected letters.&nbsp;These machine-readable documents are then put&nbsp;through a rigorous editing phase which create valid&nbsp;TEI (</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Text Encoding Initiative</span><span class="font3">) files. The sender’s and&nbsp;receiver’s addresses (that are present in the letters)&nbsp;are given unique identifiers and, consequently, geocoordinates. Specific fields(title of the letter, sender’s&nbsp;location, and link to the letter) found within the edited&nbsp;TEI documents are extracted and converted into a&nbsp;JSON object. This is the data structure and format that&nbsp;the application uses to dynamically pull information.&nbsp;The mobile application is built using the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Adobe&nbsp;PhoneGap</span><span class="font3"> framework (for the Android platform). The&nbsp;application reads the user’s device geolocation; it uses&nbsp;the haversine formula to calculate the distance&nbsp;between the user and the letters. The application&nbsp;calculates the distance between two points on the&nbsp;earth’s surface and measures the distance between&nbsp;them in metres. This distance orders the letters from&nbsp;the least to the greatest (see Fig. 1). It is then possible&nbsp;to display the letters closest to the device’s&nbsp;geolocation. Clicking each object opens an in-app&nbsp;browser that makes the text of the letter available in a&nbsp;mobile-friendly interface (see Fig. 2).</span></p><img src="251_files/251-1.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:363pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3">The presented mobile application takes electronic resources outside the paradigm of the desktop&nbsp;computer and provides a meaningful way of engaging&nbsp;with the resource. The presented paper will consider&nbsp;how this application is built and the means through&nbsp;which it makes resources accessible. It will also&nbsp;consider the drawbacks and limitations of such a&nbsp;system opening up to discussion the use of mobile&nbsp;technology in the experience of cultural resources.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgements</span></h1>
