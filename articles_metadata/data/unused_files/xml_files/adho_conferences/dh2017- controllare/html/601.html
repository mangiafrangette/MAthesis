<p><span class="font2">In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hermeneutica</span><span class="font2">, Geoffrey Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair (2016) argue for an approach to the digital humanities that deemphasizes the tool and positivist notions of proof. Their proposed approach, also called </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hermeneutica</span><span class="font2">, champions tool accessibility over tool&nbsp;sophistication. Similarly, scholarly play is legitimated&nbsp;as a useful step in developing research questions and&nbsp;as a means to reconsider established notions within&nbsp;literary disciplines. The aim of Hermeneutica as a&nbsp;methodology seems to be the generation of interesting&nbsp;humanistic questions as much as the resolution of&nbsp;open questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rockwell and Sinclair demonstrate the difference between Hermeneutica and typical DH approaches by&nbsp;quoting from Gary Wong's 2009 blog post:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">[Typical DH] takes the worst part of the scientific papers (really really long sets of tabular data in the body of the text) and the worst part&nbsp;of papers from the humanities (really really&nbsp;complicated language where simple language&nbsp;would have done) and puts it in one. If this is&nbsp;what the cooperation of computational text&nbsp;analysis and traditional literary analysis yield, I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">am scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because Hermeneutica attempts to join the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">best parts </span><span class="font2">of these fields, it has the potential to turn DH&nbsp;into a discipline that is more useful for the vast majority of non-DH humanists. It could be the means of accelerating the mainstreaming of DH methods and&nbsp;bringing us to the eventual point where all humanities&nbsp;are digital—a destination Claire Clivaz described succinctly (DARIAH, 2016).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Voyant</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">One feature that distinguishes Hermeneutica from many other DH approaches is its companion set of&nbsp;tools meant to demonstrate its application. Voyant&nbsp;Tools, now referred to simply as Voyant, is a web-based, modular suite of tools meant to be “worth&nbsp;thinking </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">with</span><span class="font2">” (Rockwell and Sinclair, 2016: 10, original emphasis). The goal is to accommodate playful exploration of text and sharing of corpora across the&nbsp;web. It is not designed as an industrial-grade text analysis tool, but as a “toy” that allows scholars to uncover&nbsp;new questions and gain new appreciation of texts.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Current limitations of Hermeneutica</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A fundamental component of Hermeneutica is that the scholar views text through the lens of Voyant (or&nbsp;other computational text analysis tools), and then synthesizes that experience with their prior knowledge of&nbsp;the text and its milieu. A problem that Voyant addresses, but does not solve, is that many scholars who&nbsp;know the most about specific texts lack the technological skills that would be considered pre-novice in DH&nbsp;circles. Voyant allows everyone with a text and a&nbsp;browser to explore word frequencies, collocations,&nbsp;etc., but it presupposes that the text is available and&nbsp;clean enough for use. In order for Hermeneutica to appeal to non-DH humanities scholars, these issues of&nbsp;text availability and the lack of user skill must first be&nbsp;addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the issue of text availability, it is not often that scholars wish to analyze text that is rare or missing.&nbsp;More often they are interested in text that is protected&nbsp;by various copyright laws, which prohibit posting the&nbsp;text to public websites such as Voyant. Thankfully, in&nbsp;the Unites States at least, Google Books' recent court&nbsp;victory (Stohr, 2016) now permits scholars to publish&nbsp;online the analysis results derived from copyrighted&nbsp;texts, so long as the original text is not recoverable by&nbsp;the user. To this end Rockwell and Sinclair developed&nbsp;Voyant 2's “non-consumptive” mode which restricts&nbsp;access to tools that allow full-text views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While such developments represent Rockwell and Sinclair's amenability to meet the ever-evolving needs&nbsp;of Hermeneuticans, accommodating users' lack of&nbsp;technology skill is beyond the scope of their involvement. For example, it is not reasonable to expect the&nbsp;Voyant developers to be concerned over issues of text&nbsp;acquisition or text preparation. Rather, those con-cerns—while critical to expanding the pool of potential Hermeneuticans—are issues of local implementation. Similarly, it makes sense that Voyant would offer&nbsp;the ability to link to a corpus after uploading the text,&nbsp;but uploading the text and keeping track of various&nbsp;versions of corpora is beyond the scope of Voyant. A&nbsp;local practice of adding some structure around the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Voyant suite ought to make Hermeneutica useful to a far greater audience than it is now.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Scaffolding</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In the field of instructional design, such structure is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">scaffolding</span><span class="font2">. Specifically, scaffolding refers to&nbsp;the process of providing learners adequate introduction and examples before allowing them to attempt a&nbsp;task on their own (Bruner, 1978). For </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">scaffolded Her-meneutica</span><span class="font2">, DH-savvy professionals can work to acquire, clean, and upload text to Voyant (and other&nbsp;tools), and then provide public listings of the resulting&nbsp;corpora.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Examples of scaffolded Hermeneutica</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">We have implemented this scaffolded Hermeneu-tica approach in our Office of Digital Humanities beginning with the Cormac McCarthy Corpus Project (CMCP). The CMCP includes 13 Voyant corpora of&nbsp;McCarthy's 10 novels: one for the complete works, one&nbsp;for each novel, and two for novels (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Orchard Keeper&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Road</span><span class="font2">) where the narration has been segregated from the dialogue. But the linchpin of scaffolded&nbsp;Hermeneutica is the CMCP's publicly-accessible website that organizes these Voyant corpora. The website&nbsp;is built on WordPress with the Pods content management plugin, and contains information on McCarthy's&nbsp;work, descriptions of Voyant (and other tools), and&nbsp;listings of links to the Voyant corpora. An essential feature of the website's structure is the ability to accommodate revisions to the current corpora as well as the&nbsp;addition of other tools in the future. Already, there is a&nbsp;non-Voyant sentence structure search tool attached as&nbsp;a beta-testing option.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A rough version of the Cormac McCarthy Corpus Project was presented at the 2015 conference of the&nbsp;Cormac McCarthy Society. The reaction to these tools&nbsp;being available for public use was strongly positive.&nbsp;One attendee referred to the website as “a game-changer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same scaffolded Hermeneutica is being implemented on two other projects: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Machado a longa distancia</span><span class="font2"> and The Modernist Short Fiction Project. Preliminary demonstrations of the approach have yielded similar reactions to what we observed with the CMCP.&nbsp;Non-DH scholars become excited rather than anxious&nbsp;when the digital analysis tools are scaffolded to provide them ready access. In fact, these demonstrations&nbsp;turn into play sessions where non-DH scholars repeatedly request for certain words to be added to the frequency charts and other Voyant panels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hermeneutica and Voyant represent the greatest potential for growth in DH not because they are the&nbsp;most technologically or theoretically </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">advanced </span><span class="font2">developments, but because they are the most </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">accessible </span><span class="font2">to&nbsp;non-DH scholars. Still, they don't quite reach the&nbsp;ground level of technology skills possessed by most researchers in the humanities. The scaffolded Herme-neutica approach proposed in this paper seems to&nbsp;span that gap to make Hermeneutica more accessible.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
