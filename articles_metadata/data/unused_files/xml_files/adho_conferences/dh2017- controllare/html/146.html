<p><span class="font4">In the mid-1850s, American educator and editor Elizabeth Peabody (1804-1894) set off from Boston&nbsp;to ride the rails. She traveled as far north as Rochester, NY; as far west as Louisville, KY; and as far south&nbsp;as Richmond, VA, in order to promote the textbook&nbsp;she had recently published, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A Chronological History of&nbsp;the United States</span><span class="font4"> (1856). Along with her suitcase,&nbsp;Peabody traveled with a large fabric roll, which, when&nbsp;unrolled, displayed a grid-like array of colored&nbsp;squares that represented the major events in U.S. history. In the nineteenth-century version of a product&nbsp;demo, Peabody would arrange the “painted centuries,” as she called them, on the floor, and invite potential textbook adopters to sit around the charts and&nbsp;contemplate the colors and patterns that they perceived (9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although not described in terms of visualization--the term did not enter common parlance until the early twentieth century--Peabody’s ideas about the&nbsp;uses of her charts anticipate many of the benefits associated with visualization today: the ability to “offload” mental processing “from cognitive to perceptual systems,” to “enhance” pattern recognition&nbsp;through “abstraction and aggregation,” and, crucially,&nbsp;to interact with and potentially “manipulate” the visualization itself (Card et al. 1999, 16). For Peabody&nbsp;did not only imagine that her readers would interpret&nbsp;the “data” presented on her charts; she also intended&nbsp;for them to create charts of their own. To this end,&nbsp;Peabody also sold workbooks of blank charts, so that&nbsp;students could read each chapter of her textbook, and&nbsp;then convert the list of events that followed into color&nbsp;and position, according to her visual scheme.</span></p><img src="146_files/146-1.jpg" style="width:191pt;height:192pt;"/>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Project Overview</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Drawing from recent digital humanities work relating to historical fabrication (e.g. Elliott et al. 2012, Sayers 2015), as well as from our own previous explorations of historical visualization techniques (e.g.&nbsp;Foster et al. 2016), we set out to recreate and enhance Peabody’s pioneering visual design. In particular, we focused on Peabody’s ideas about interaction&nbsp;and interpretation, since her ideas about the tripartite relation between data, text, and image-- and the&nbsp;role of the reader in translating between each-- speak&nbsp;directly to current debates in the digital humanities&nbsp;about the importance of acknowledging data as “capta” (Drucker 2011), and of recognizing the role of individual interpretation in both the design and reception of visualizations (Posner 2016). In our project,&nbsp;we focused first on reimagining Peabody’s original&nbsp;interaction for the web, employing current information visualization research to suggest techniques&nbsp;for emphasizing the interrelation between the data&nbsp;and their visual display. We then began a project to&nbsp;recreate the floor-sized version of Peabody’s chart&nbsp;using physical computing materials, so as to further&nbsp;explore the embodied aspects of Peabody’s visualization scheme. In the following sections, we describe&nbsp;the design choices involved in each recreation-- the&nbsp;digital and the physical-- with particular attention to&nbsp;how we sought to amplify Peabody’s ideas about interaction, interpretation, and embodiment through&nbsp;our reimagined interfaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Shape of History: Reimagining</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Interaction and Interpretation for the Web</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The website located at </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">shapeofhistory.net</span><span class="font4"> represents the culmination of a year-long iterative design process. From Peabody's original textbook, we distilled four conceptual modes of interaction: an “explore” mode, designed to explain to novice users how&nbsp;to interpret her charts, and how to translate between&nbsp;text and image; a “lesson” mode, designed to allow&nbsp;users to create their own charts, drawing upon Peabody's original data; a “compare” mode, designed to&nbsp;call attention to how choices in visual display affect&nbsp;the charts' ultimate interpretation; and a “play”&nbsp;mode, intended to facilitate the most open-ended&nbsp;form of interaction and expression. To implement the&nbsp;site, we employed a combination of HTML5, CSS, and&nbsp;JavaScript, including Bootstrap.js for site structure,&nbsp;jQuery for navigation and site-level interaction, and&nbsp;D3.js and two.js (along with custom JavaScript) for&nbsp;the visualization components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At each juncture, we considered how to enhance Peabody's original designs and interactions. For instance, when recreating the grid that would serve as&nbsp;the primary typographical form, we remained faithful&nbsp;to the original design and color palette, while adding&nbsp;additional minor grid lines (in light gray) so that users would know where to click (White 2011). In order&nbsp;to emphasize the relation between text and image, an&nbsp;important feature of both the “explore” and “compare” modes, we added a simple interaction, known&nbsp;as “brushing,” so that hovering over a single event in&nbsp;either the text or the image would simultaneously&nbsp;highlight both elements, as well as the corresponding&nbsp;location on the chart's key (Stasko 2007). For the&nbsp;“lesson” mode, we augmented the features developed&nbsp;for the other two modes with a more guided experience, akin to the lesson that Peabody described in her&nbsp;textbook, through proceduralized interaction (Bogost&nbsp;2007). In the lesson, users must read each event, one&nbsp;at a time, translate it into color, and then place the&nbsp;colored square in the appropriate location on the&nbsp;grid. Through enhanced user cues, such as converting&nbsp;the cursor to a pointer as it hovers over the grid, and&nbsp;highlighting empty squares as the user hovers over&nbsp;them, users are guided through a digital version of&nbsp;the interactive lesson that Peabody envisioned in&nbsp;print.</span></p><img src="146_files/146-3.jpg" style="width:239pt;height:150pt;"/>

<p><span class="font4">Reimagining Peabody's historical visualization scheme for the web helps to underscore how she understood interpretation as a fundamental part of the&nbsp;process of perceiving visualizations. Her visual design&nbsp;bears very little relation to the immediately intuitive&nbsp;images that we associate with visualization today.&nbsp;And yet, for Peabody, the abstraction of the chart was&nbsp;part of its purpose; she intended her charts to be individually interpreted by each person who encountered them. More than that, she envisioned her charts&nbsp;as lessons in themselves--lessons that often took time&nbsp;and effort in order to complete. In this way, the interactions she envisioned, while made quicker and more&nbsp;intuitive through their digital recreation, lose some of&nbsp;their original intent, in that Peabody did not identify&nbsp;efficiency as a feature of her designs. Instead, she&nbsp;viewed the interpretive process--sometimes difficult</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and often slow-- as the best source of historical</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">knowledge. The “lesson” of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Shape of History,</span><span class="font4"> as</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">distinct from Peabody's original scheme, is a reminder of how little interpretation is intended-- even if it is still required--when encountering visualizations of&nbsp;data today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Floor Chart: Reimagining Embodiment through Physical Computing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the digital version of the project emphasizes Peabody's interest in facilitating interaction and interpretation, it does not convey the embodied aspects&nbsp;of the original interaction; looking at a screen is a far&nbsp;different experience than walking around a rug-sized&nbsp;chart on the floor. To reimagine this embodied mode&nbsp;of interaction, we designed a one-meter by one-meter&nbsp;floor chart, consisting of a matrix of thirty by thirty&nbsp;individually addressable light-emitting diodes&nbsp;(LEDs). Each LED corresponds to one subsection of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Peabody's original chart, so that the 900 possible events can be represented. (We cannot account for&nbsp;multiple simultaneous events, however). The LEDs&nbsp;can be pre-programmed via custom software, which&nbsp;makes use of Adafruit's NeoPixel library. We are also&nbsp;in the process of developing a flexible touch interface,&nbsp;using conductive copper tape and neoprene, so that&nbsp;the LEDs can be controlled through a soft button-like&nbsp;interaction. Both the LEDs and the touch interface are&nbsp;controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller.</span></p><img src="146_files/146-4.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:136pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0">Figure 5: The touch interface in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We view this project as one of speculative design</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Dunne and Raby 2013). Since Peabody's original</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">floor charts were not preserved, we must speculate about everything from the size of the chart, to the&nbsp;colors employed, to the events depicted. While we&nbsp;have textual accounts, in Peabody's correspondence,&nbsp;of how nineteenth-century viewers would interact&nbsp;with the floor charts, the original charts were obviously not programmable. What the reimagined floor&nbsp;chart teach us, then, is about how we might incorporate embodied elements into current visualization&nbsp;design practices, as much as about how viewers interacted with large-scale visualizations in the past. It&nbsp;also reminds us about the labor involved in fabricating the original charts. (Peabody complained about&nbsp;the magnitude of the task in her correspondence).&nbsp;The work of data visualization, while not always expressed in physical form, is always the work of many&nbsp;hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions and Next Steps</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In their foundational essay on historical fabrication, Devon Elliott et al. observe that “working with actual, physical </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">stuff</span><span class="font4"> offers the historian new opportunities to explore the interactions of people and&nbsp;things” (2012). In this project, we have sought to extend these opportunities for exploration to include&nbsp;the interactions of people with data, as well as with&nbsp;their visual display. Our project underscores the&nbsp;foundational role of interpretation in designing and&nbsp;perceiving visualizations; and shows how interaction&nbsp;is crucial to the interpretive process. It also points to&nbsp;future modes of visualization, not yet imagined, that&nbsp;might better emphasize embodied ways of knowing.&nbsp;In terms of next steps, for the website, we plan to&nbsp;think through what a more scholarly version of the&nbsp;site, with room for more explanatory text, might look&nbsp;like. For the physicalization, we are continuing to implement the touch interface. From there, we will focus on the aesthetic aspects of the rug, exploring options for light-diffusing fabrics to frame the LEDs, and&nbsp;light-blocking materials to create the grid-lines.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></p>
