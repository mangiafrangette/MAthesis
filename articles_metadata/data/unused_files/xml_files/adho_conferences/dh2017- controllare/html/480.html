<p><span class="font4">Revivalism has always played a significant role in the social functioning of religion in the US. As argued&nbsp;by McClymond, &quot;religious revivals are as American as&nbsp;baseball, blues music, and the stars and stripes&quot; (2010,&nbsp;306). This strong presence of revivalism in the American religious landscape translates into the considerable significance of revival preaching not only for the&nbsp;American pulpit practice, but also for American culture in general. One could argue that a certain continuity is discernible in the American revival tradition, and&nbsp;preachers of consecutive &quot;Awakenings&quot;, starting with&nbsp;the Great Awakening, have utilized similar communicative strategies, analogous sets of cultural references,&nbsp;as well as persuasive ploys to forward the &quot;New Birth&quot;&nbsp;to their hearers and to spread the revival zeal. Billy&nbsp;Graham, the most celebrated televangelist of the 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century, testified to the importance of this tradition&nbsp;when in 1949 in Los Angeles, during the &quot;Canvas Cathedral&quot; Crusade, he delivered to a contemporary audience the most notorious sermon of the Great Awakening (and, perhaps, of America's entire pulpit oratory), Jonathan Edwards's </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sinners in the Hands of an&nbsp;Angry God</span><span class="font4">. Graham was by no means a pioneer in this&nbsp;respect, as the 19<sup>th</sup> century American revivalists, like&nbsp;Charles Finney, eagerly fell back on the rhetorical heritage of the first Great Awakening sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Crowds of thousands of people, the emotional reactions of the audiences which often bordered on mass hysteria, fervent theological debates and a surplus of&nbsp;publications played a significant role in the shaping of&nbsp;the early American ecclesiastical order. Similarly, the&nbsp;American rhetorical tradition was strongly informed&nbsp;by the revival developments in pulpit oratory, especially in the context of both the oratory of the American Revolution and the Civil War. New forms of&nbsp;preaching manifested the power of the spoken word,&nbsp;and propelled the dynamics of public debate in a period which was to prove vital for the development of&nbsp;American identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The study of American preaching tradition from the diachronic perspective seems particularly important.&nbsp;Different groups of preachers in consecutive Great&nbsp;Awakenings, (First 1735-1750, Second 1790-1840,&nbsp;Third 1850-1900, Fourth 1960-1980) appropriated&nbsp;the rhetorical models employed by the previous generations and built upon their output.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, because of the sheer size of the available corpus, the comparative study of the preachers of all&nbsp;Great Awakening has been so far impossible. Stylome-try based on word usage makes it possible to highlight&nbsp;the connections between particular groups of preachers, as well as to demonstrate the evolution of the&nbsp;American revival preaching tradition; and to confront&nbsp;these findings with the existing attempts at classifica-tion/chronology (Stout 1986).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In our study, 42 collections of sermons by individual preachers (one text file per preacher) have been collected, digitized and modernized to avoid an excessive chronological bias due to spelling differences; of&nbsp;course, purely linguistic bias could not be entirely&nbsp;eliminated. Of these, 13 are traditionally classified as&nbsp;First Awakening; 9 as Second; 19 as Third; the most&nbsp;traditionally controversial group, Fourth, is represented by Billy Graham alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Classification was made by comparing distances, or differences, between most-frequent-word frequencies&nbsp;of the texts using Burrows's Delta procedure (2002);&nbsp;the distance measure applied was “Cosine Delta” as&nbsp;proposed by Jannidis et al. (2015), implemented in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">stylo</span><span class="font4"> package (Eder et al. 2015, 2016) for R (). The&nbsp;word frequencies were submitted to a consensus procedure of cluster analysis at word frequency vectors of&nbsp;100 to 2000 most frequent words, and these results&nbsp;then served to produce network diagrams in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gephi&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">(Bastian et al. 2009) using the gravitational Force Atlas 2 algorithm (Jacomy et al. 2014). This produces a&nbsp;network or a “map” of data points for the individual&nbsp;preachers' sermons; the closer and the thicker the&nbsp;links between them, the more similar they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Figure 1 presents such a network graph for the 42 preachers. The color coding follows the traditional division into four “Awakenings” (from First, green,&nbsp;through Second, yellow, Third, red, and Fourth, purple). A very strong evolutionary pattern emerges;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">apart from minor imperfections, the network shows a clear evolution from the earliest preachers to the most&nbsp;modern one, Graham. At the same time, the grouping&nbsp;of the data points suggest that a different classification&nbsp;might also exist in the dataset. This is why another algorithm available in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gephi</span><span class="font4">, “Modularity,” was used to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">discover these “communities,” or groups (Blondel et al.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2008).</span></p><img src="480_files/480-1.jpg" style="width:236pt;height:81pt;"/><img src="480_files/480-2.jpg" style="width:235pt;height:35pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. The four Great Awakenings in traditional classification (top); divided by modularity into 3 (center) and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 (bottom) groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This produces two alternatives to the traditional division of the Revivalist movements(s). In the first of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">these (center), what is usually referred to as the First and the Second Great Awakening would be merged&nbsp;into a single group, while the traditional Third Awakening splits into early and late phases; the latter of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">which now also included the single representative of the Fourth. Perhaps more interestingly, computergenerated four Awakening communities (bottom) suggest a First only limited to some of Edwards's contemporaries, a Second that extends a little more than traditionally into the past, and again a limited early Third&nbsp;with an expanded Fourth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is of course not to say that the above results</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">invalidate the traditional, or historical, division of American revivalist writing. But the stylistic (or, at&nbsp;least, stylometric) divisions are no less valid. Most-frequent-word usage is a significant element of distant&nbsp;reading; and such a distant reading of the Revivalism</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">opens new avenues for close reading of the American homiletic tradition.</span></p>
