<p><span class="font2">In a publishing landscape long challenged by small audiences, tightening library budgets, and steady&nbsp;growth in the number of monographs produced each&nbsp;year, potentially illegal text sharing has become an&nbsp;everyday practice for many humanities scholars and&nbsp;students, both those with access to conventional distributions channels (libraries, online databases, interlibrary loan) as well as independent scholars and&nbsp;those at institutions with limited library resources.&nbsp;Whereas many researchers in medicine and natural&nbsp;science disciplines have embraced open access publication practices, both in open-licensed journals and&nbsp;via centralized preprint repositories, access to scholarship in humanities fields poses greater challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Due to humanities monographs' limited commercial value, many titles are only commercially available for a short window. As Borgman has noted, “[l]itera-ture in the humanities goes out of print long before it&nbsp;goes out of date” (2007: 241), while older works from&nbsp;university presses are “virtually entombed” (McGann,&nbsp;2014: 133) in the stacks of academic libraries. Meanwhile, factors including rising journal prices and an increase in the number of monographs published each&nbsp;year have led libraries to purchase proportionally&nbsp;fewer monographs than in past decades (Thompson,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2005: 103-6). In turn, humanities scholars’ reputation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">for “unreadable complexity” (Eve, 2014: 22) may be exacerbated by the unavailability of published research. By contrast, informal circulation can provide a&nbsp;double benefit to scholars, allowing them to secure the&nbsp;prestige of publishing with a name-brand university&nbsp;press while reaching a larger audience than would be&nbsp;possible in print alone (Hall 2013). In this paper, I&nbsp;draw on public metadata sets, download logs from Sci-Hub (Bohannon and Elbakyan, 2016), and interviews&nbsp;with operators and users of illicit text sharing sites to&nbsp;examine their place in contemporary humanities&nbsp;scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A decade ago, illicit text collections, also known as shadow libraries (Liang 2012; Bodo 2015, 2016), were&nbsp;limited in size and existed on the margins of academic&nbsp;culture. Today, one can find millions of books and tens&nbsp;of millions of journal articles spread among Library&nbsp;Genesis, Aaaaarg, and Sci-Hub, as well as in niche collections such as Memory of the World and Monoskop&nbsp;Log. And yet, these sites’ coverage of literary works&nbsp;and literary scholarship is significantly shallower than&nbsp;is the case for published research in medicine, engineering, and the social sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most shadow libraries are messy, ad hoc affairs, composed of digital objects in a range of formats and&nbsp;quality levels, drawn from a pre-existing ecosystem of&nbsp;interpersonal text sharing among scholars and students. Metadata for the 1.5 million documents in Library Genesis, which is freely available, exhibits what&nbsp;we might call bounded messiness. A tabular dataset&nbsp;riddled with missing values, text encoding quirks, and&nbsp;duplicate entries, it clearly would not pass muster in&nbsp;an academic library setting. However, the simplicity&nbsp;and flexibility of this system make it well-suited for a&nbsp;text collection compiled, maintained, and mirrored by&nbsp;a culturally diverse community of participants. In this&nbsp;case, a just-good-enough database supports the goals&nbsp;of inclusiveness and replication by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In interviews with scholars who use shadow libraries, I have observed a wide range of positions with respect to copyright law and the business of scholarly publishing. While some hope for a future in which copyright is abolished and publishers are driven out of&nbsp;business, many are essentially satisfied with the scholarly publishing ecosystem as it stands today. Most use&nbsp;library resources and purchase physical books, turning to shadow libraries to fill the gaps and evaluate&nbsp;texts’ relevance and quality. Nearly all respondents&nbsp;said they prefer to read printed texts when the option&nbsp;is available. Moreover, if the cost of these sites’ continued existence is that they remain culturally marginal,&nbsp;my participants see this as an acceptable tradeoff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Several interview participants described their personal document management schemes, an age-old form of scholarly labor that typically remains invisible&nbsp;to outsiders. What is new, however, is that some avid&nbsp;collectors are systematically compiling clean copies of&nbsp;their personal libraries, along with extensive metadata&nbsp;and searchable full-text indexes. They then share these&nbsp;collections among colleagues, either on hard drives or&nbsp;in private online repositories. One respondent described this text curation practice as both a pedagogical strategy and an attempt to shape the scholarly&nbsp;canon in his field of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are no easy answers to the problems shadow</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">libraries pose for publishers and university libraries,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">leading Bodo (2016) to suggest we should “bet on all horses,” throwing support behind academic publishers and shadow libraries alike. For now, exploring how&nbsp;where shadow libraries come from, how they are designed, curated, and maintained, and what their futures may hold — including the eventual, inevitable,&nbsp;closure of individual sites — may help us understand&nbsp;current academic culture and possible future models&nbsp;for humanities research and scholarly culture more&nbsp;broadly.</span></p>
