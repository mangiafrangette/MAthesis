<p><span class="font2">The Victoria Press began as an outgrowth of SPEW (Society for Promoting the Employment of Women), a&nbsp;group of Victorian feminists who sought to provide&nbsp;new avenues for women’s work in the printing&nbsp;industry. SPEW activists, led by Emily Faithfull, set up&nbsp;a Press where women worked as compositors (Tusan,&nbsp;2004; Fredeman, 1974). Presswomen printed&nbsp;anthologies, tracts, and feminist periodicals, including&nbsp;the monthly English Woman’s Journal (1858-1864),&nbsp;which published mainly contributions by women.&nbsp;Publication of the English Woman’s Journal (EWJ)&nbsp;spanned “the period between the failed attempt to&nbsp;reform legislation that prevented married women&nbsp;holding property in 1857 and the equally unsuccessful&nbsp;attempt to win female suffrage in 1867” (Mussell,&nbsp;2008). Articles in the EWJ promoted both of these&nbsp;reform measures and advocated for female&nbsp;employment in different fields, as well as other&nbsp;contemporary feminist causes. My use of the term&nbsp;“feminist,” though anachronistic to the movement, has&nbsp;been accepted by other scholars writing about the&nbsp;period, who choose the word to demonstrate an active&nbsp;and purposeful engagement with the continuous&nbsp;struggle for women’s rights (see Phegley, 2004;&nbsp;Mussell, 2012; Frawley, 1999).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My digital project, The Victoria Press Circle, funded by Princeton’s Center for Digital Humanities, offers&nbsp;open-access network visualizations of the women and&nbsp;men involved in the Victoria Press, based on contents&nbsp;of the EWJ and three anthologies printed at the Press&nbsp;between 1861 and 1863. The Victoria Press Circle’s&nbsp;first aim is reconstruction: the project helps to&nbsp;establish the history of the Victoria Press, since there&nbsp;is no existing archive. This is especially important&nbsp;since the EWJ includes a high percentage of unsigned&nbsp;contributions (about 40 percent). None of the women&nbsp;who published in the EWJ currently have significant&nbsp;digital representation. Identifying them as individuals&nbsp;combats the critical undervaluing of texts in female-produced periodicals, and studying them as a group&nbsp;highlights authors who may not receive attention&nbsp;individually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, this project demonstrates collaboration. A network-focused approach is&nbsp;particularly appropriate because the Victoria Press&nbsp;was constructed on a material model of collaborative&nbsp;female labor. Its founders explicitly attempted to build&nbsp;a hub of social interaction around the Press, creating&nbsp;venues to promote women’s rights. SPEW members&nbsp;saw their office as a meeting place for women&nbsp;advocating for female employment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is also the intention of the Society to render their office a depot for information of every kind relating to&nbsp;the employment of women. Curious and interesting&nbsp;facts will be collected. Extracts from newspapers,&nbsp;pamphlets, and speeches on the subject, will be&nbsp;gathered together, and kept for the inspection of&nbsp;members of the Society (EWJ, 1859).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In creating network graphs, I am reconstructing how the Presswomen built a social network for&nbsp;themselves, not imposing intentionality on their&nbsp;project (Weingart, 2013). All of my data will be freely&nbsp;available and downloadable in .csv format for other&nbsp;researchers to access and use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ultimately, The Victoria Press Circle’s open-access website will display at least three network&nbsp;visualizations, constructed in Cytoscape, of those&nbsp;involved in the Press: one composite graph for the&nbsp;three anthologies; one graph for the EWJ; and one&nbsp;combined visualization for all the publications.&nbsp;Cytoscape, though a tool designed for biomolecular&nbsp;analysis, is more flexible than Gephi for social network&nbsp;analysis, especially for specific functions of filtering&nbsp;based on node and edge attributes and on network&nbsp;statistics (see Shannon, 2003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to literary contributors, my visualizations include compositors, engravers,&nbsp;printers, editors, and paper manufacturers. Marianne&nbsp;Van Remoortel (2015) has helped in identifying names&nbsp;of compositors from newspaper reports and census&nbsp;data. While the individual model of many digital&nbsp;archives privileges authors and minimizes others&nbsp;involved in literary production, the women of the Press&nbsp;were working at every level of print culture to advance&nbsp;their social aims. By valuing all types of contributions&nbsp;equally, my visualizations illustrate their collaborative&nbsp;effort. The Presswomen’s project echoes through&nbsp;current debates in digital humanities about the&nbsp;necessity of learning to code for engagement in DH&nbsp;work (Dinsman, 2016). I believe that programming&nbsp;can be a feminist act for scholars, just as involvement&nbsp;in print culture was a feminist act for Victorian female&nbsp;authors. The artisan practice of printing is analogous&nbsp;to the artisan practice of coding, and both are affected&nbsp;by experiences of gender, race, class, and sexuality. I&nbsp;hope to use my project to show how women worked&nbsp;with their hands and their pens in tandem, and how&nbsp;I’m continuing that work today.</span></p>
