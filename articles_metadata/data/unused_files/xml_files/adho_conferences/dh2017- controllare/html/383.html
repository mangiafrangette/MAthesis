<p><span class="font4">Over the past several years, as part of a Digging into Data Grant and in conjunction with Oxford University's e-Research Centre, the ARTFL Project at the University of Chicago has been developing a large-scale</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">online resource that allows scholars to examine text</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">reuse in the 18th century. We used sequence alignment algorithms to compile a database of textual repetitions found in the Gale-Cengage </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eighteenth Century Collections Online</span><span class="font4"> (ECCO) corpus, which contains the&nbsp;200,000 works that represent most of the printed literary and scientific output in Britain from 1700 to&nbsp;1799.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Digital Humanities 2016 in Krakow, we presented the methodology and algorithms we used to identify these reuses and showed the early results of&nbsp;our work (Roe et al, 2016; for earlier discussions of&nbsp;this project, see Roe et al, 2015 and Abdul-Rahman et&nbsp;al, 2016). For the upcoming Digital Humanities conference, our presentation will have two facets. First, we&nbsp;will outline the technical and editorial approaches we&nbsp;took when building the final version of the alignment&nbsp;database to maximize its usability and usefulness as a&nbsp;scholarly resource (See the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Common Place Cultures&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">project site</span><span class="font4">, and its </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">page on the University of Chicago&nbsp;domain</span><span class="font4">). Secondly, we will discuss a use case of the database in which we examined reuses and citations of&nbsp;the first-century BC Roman poet, Lucretius, as a means&nbsp;to get a broad understanding of the 18th-century reception of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De Rerum Natura,</span><span class="font4"> the philosophical&nbsp;poem that proposes a materialist conception of the&nbsp;universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To construct the database, we used the PhiloLine (see Horton et al, 2010) sequence aligner to identify&nbsp;many millions of similar passages in the often low-quality OCR of the ECCO dataset. These passages range&nbsp;from a handful of words to large extracts of documents. We then used a similar passage matching algorithm to identify passages that were reused many&nbsp;times. The resulting database allows users to track&nbsp;specific passages, identify citations of specific texts in&nbsp;later texts, and find borrowed passages in later documents of an author’s oeuvre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the creators and users of our navigational tool, we had to decide on the nature and scope of research&nbsp;the database should support and then strike balances&nbsp;between feasibility, usability, and performance. One of&nbsp;our earliest concerns was to allow users to get a fairly&nbsp;long view of textual reception/citation. To be able to&nbsp;identify the true source of any given reuse, we made&nbsp;the editorial decision to include texts that predated the&nbsp;18th century. We therefore extended our alignment&nbsp;detection procedure to a variety of curated datasets&nbsp;such as the King James Bible, Classical Latin texts, and&nbsp;EEBO-TCP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our extended alignment experiment was extremely successful: we uncovered more than 40 million text reuses across our multiple datasets. At the same time,&nbsp;this success raised the problem of devising a way to&nbsp;explore result sets of a huge scale efficiently, leading&nbsp;us to focus on building a navigation tool that provides&nbsp;filtering and sorting control to users in a precise and&nbsp;intuitive way. We added various UI elements to guide&nbsp;users in their exploration: a list of the most commonly&nbsp;cited authors just a click away from the input box; a&nbsp;faceted browser to help users narrow down search results; and a timeline view of any given text reuse (see&nbsp;Appendix for screenshots) Combined together, these&nbsp;choices greatly enhance the capabilities of our web application, making it a tool that can very easily track intellectual influence from the classical Latin era to the&nbsp;late 18 th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the second part of our presentation we will discuss a use case of our database, examining citations of Lucretius’s Latin text in 18th-century English texts.&nbsp;Our aim was to fill in gaps in current scholarship and&nbsp;discover the aftereffects of the resurgence in interest&nbsp;in Lucretius’s work, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De Rerum Natura (DRN),</span><span class="font4"> at the&nbsp;middle of the 17th century in England (for example,&nbsp;Greenblatt (2011) gives only very cursory treatment&nbsp;to reception of Lucretius in the 18th century in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Swerve</span><span class="font4">). During this so called “Epicurean revival,”&nbsp;John Evelyn (1656) and Lucy Hutchinson (unpublished) were the first to translate, either in part or&nbsp;whole, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DNR</span><span class="font4"> into English. Walter Charlton published his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana,&nbsp;or, A fabrick of science natural, upon the hypothesis of&nbsp;atoms</span><span class="font4"> in 1654. And though Thomas Hobbes never cites&nbsp;Lucretius directly in his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leviathan</span><span class="font4"> (1651), the Latin&nbsp;poet's ideas about the material nature of the universe&nbsp;are a distinct antecedent to Hobbes's mechanical philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even around the time of the revival, the reception of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DRN</span><span class="font4"> was vexed. Lucretius's statements about&nbsp;the materiality and mortality of the soul, the role of&nbsp;chance in the universe, and the detachment of the gods&nbsp;were far too radical ever to gain wide acceptance in&nbsp;early modern England. In the backlash against&nbsp;Hobbesianism in the 1660s, Lucretius was a prime target for criticism. Cottegnies (2016) argues that the&nbsp;backlash against Hobbes's ideas in the 1660s also&nbsp;marks the end of the Epicurean moment. Theologians&nbsp;writing against Hobbes attacked Lucretius's atheistic&nbsp;materialism. And though Lucretius's stature as a poet&nbsp;continued to grow, praise for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DRN</span><span class="font4"> was almost always&nbsp;tempered. His more extreme ideas were to be dismissed or ignored. In the notes to his translation of&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">DRN</span><span class="font4"> in 1682, the first complete translation published&nbsp;in English, Thomas Creech argued against Lucretian&nbsp;and Epicurean attitudes toward the soul and divinity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Creech and Dryden, 1700; these citations refer to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">text published</span><span class="font4"> using the PhiloLogic build of eebo). John Dryden, the preeminent arbiter of literary taste&nbsp;of his era, quoted Lucretius often in his plays and included translations of select passages in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvae</span><span class="font4"> (1685).&nbsp;In his preface to that collection, Dryden praised the directness of Lucretius's poetic expression, pointing out&nbsp;the “positive assertion of his Opinion” and his “Magisterial authority.” But the subject of his poem is “naturally Crabbed” and the poet himself is “often in the&nbsp;wrong” (Dryden, 1685; </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">text published online</span><span class="font4"> by Philo-logic)<sup>.</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reuses and citations found in the Digging into Data database suggest that this basic framework for understanding Lucretius largely played out across the 18th&nbsp;century. Lucretius was at once an admired poet, a materialist attacked for not admitting divine involvement&nbsp;in the universe, and a philosopher who in fact had important things to say about living well. Even so, the&nbsp;alignment database allows us to see a handful of authors, mostly medical and scientific writers, whose&nbsp;views of Lucretius and his ideas veer from this basic&nbsp;narrative. Mainly toward the middle and latter parts of&nbsp;the century, some reuses suggest a less troubled acceptance of Lucretius's naturalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through this presentation, we hope to show that this alignment database, through the accumulation of&nbsp;so many instances of citation, can facilitate a kind of&nbsp;large-scope reading that allows scholars to gain a nu-anced sense of longer term intellectual trends. Built on&nbsp;a huge quantity of uncorrected OCR, the database provides scholars the specific source evidence -- and a&nbsp;ready means to access it -- that they might need as a&nbsp;starting point to pursue even deeper investigations&nbsp;into the thought of the 18th century.</span></p>
