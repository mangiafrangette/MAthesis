<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How does Google Cultural Institute Affect the&nbsp;Collections of Museums?&nbsp;The Case of Turkey</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sumeyye Akfa</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><a href="mailto:sumeyyeakca@hacettepe.edu.tr">sumeyyeakca@hacettepe.edu.tr</a> Hacettepe University, Turkey</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In recent years, progress on information and communication technology (ICT) has affected the management of cultural heritage. While ICT plays a key role in the accessibility and informed experiences of the public, it is also becoming more apparent in creating participatory platforms for people who manage and enjoy&nbsp;cultural heritage (Lekakis and Chrysanthi, 2011). Thus&nbsp;cultural memory institutions use this technology for&nbsp;creating digital content about their collections and&nbsp;making this content available from all over the world.&nbsp;Increasing the value of collections using sophisticated&nbsp;and innovative new media also affects the economic&nbsp;development of countries and provides more integrated awareness about cultural identity and crosscultural communication (Brizard, Derde, Silberman,&nbsp;2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ICT has provided a wide range of tools for cultural heritage management. Implementing these new tools&nbsp;also provides many advantages for both memory institutions and users. Memory institutions can manage&nbsp;their collections more easily with support for image&nbsp;processing, advanced publishing systems, and etc. Furthermore, while open access to public involvement in&nbsp;cultural heritage objects improves the public awareness and sense of belonging to the society, it also develops the content of the objects with crowdsourcing&nbsp;from all over the world. In order to benefit from these&nbsp;advantages of new media tools, cultural memory institutions have opened their collections to the global&nbsp;public regardless of geographic location. Thus,&nbsp;memory institutions also benefit from increasing their&nbsp;promotion and advertising among other countries and&nbsp;institutions (Myat, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of these new media platforms is Google Cultural Institute, which has been applied to the cultural heritage area in recent years, especially in museums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of this institution is to provide broad public awareness, use and augmented access online for cultural heritage objects. It offers a range of tools that&nbsp;make it easy for memory institutes to put the collections online. With the online exhibitions, memory institutions can create stories about their collections.&nbsp;People can reach these collections all around the&nbsp;world using a wide range of platforms, and can share&nbsp;the images they like with friends using their social media accounts (Google Cultural Institute, 2016). In his&nbsp;2016 TED talk, the head of Google Cultural Institute,&nbsp;Amit Sood says “The world is filled with incredible objects and rich cultural heritage. And when we get access to them, we are blown away, we fall in love. But&nbsp;most of the time, the world's population is living without real access to arts and culture.” This new platform&nbsp;allows users to experience the world's cultural heritage objects, and to add comments about them as well.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are ten museums in Turkey putting their collections on Google Cultural Institute. All of these ten museums are private. They are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rezan Has Museum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elgiz Museum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sakip Sabanci Museum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borusan Contemporary</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murat Istanbul Festival</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masumiyet Museum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Istanbul Museum of Modern Art</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Istanbul Research Institute</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pera Museum</span></p><img src="501_files/501-1.jpg" style="width:236pt;height:132pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3">In this study, the data about visibility and access of these ten museums is analyzed looking at the previous&nbsp;and next data of the collections that are added to this&nbsp;online platform. For detailed analysis of this issue, interviews were conducted with curators and managers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of these ten museums regarding their observations of this new platform. The web activities of the museums&nbsp;-before and after- are also visualized. In addition, the&nbsp;data about the social media usage of these museums&nbsp;and its effect on increasing visibility and access of the&nbsp;collections are discussed. To understand the data in&nbsp;this study, these research questions are answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. How does this online platform affect the visibility of these collections?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. Does it affect the diversity of visitors being&nbsp;national or international?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. What are the advantages and disadvantages&nbsp;of this new platform?</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
