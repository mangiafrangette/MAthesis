<p><span class="font2">The Internet, along with the advent of online technologies has provided researchers with greater&nbsp;opportunities to collaborate and create a myriad of&nbsp;digital projects. Taking our research group as an&nbsp;example, we have collaborated in creating online art&nbsp;catalogs (Meneses et al., 2011), interfaces for&nbsp;visualizing and creating poetry (Meneses et al., 2013),&nbsp;and tools for analyzing and exploring Shakespeare’s&nbsp;plays (Meneses et al., 2015, Meneses et al., 2016a).&nbsp;However, the convenience and familiarity of computer&nbsp;networks makes us forget (or overlook) that there is a&nbsp;certain fragility associated with our online tools. In&nbsp;turn, this fragility threatens the completeness and the&nbsp;sustainability of our work over time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nowadays, a large portion of the research carried out in the digital humanities includes an online project&nbsp;as one of its components. In turn, these digital projects&nbsp;can be catalogued as distributed resources, which&nbsp;implies that the administrative control of information&nbsp;related to a topic may be spread across online&nbsp;resources and/or collections maintained by multiple&nbsp;scholars in different institutions. This administrative&nbsp;decentralization can lead to changes in content that&nbsp;are often unexpected by a researcher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These unexpected changes can be caused by different factors or circumstances. Changes can occur&nbsp;because of deliberate actions on part of the collector -for example, reorganization of the structure of the&nbsp;collection, switching to a different content&nbsp;management system, or changing jobs and&nbsp;institutions. Changes might also be due to unexpected&nbsp;events - earthquakes, power outages, disk failures, -or may be due to other uncontrollable factors - death,&nbsp;seizure of computers by law enforcement, or&nbsp;termination of the services from an Internet Service&nbsp;Provider (Mccown et al., 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over time, great strides have been made to harness and manage the fragility of online resources. Klein and&nbsp;Nelson argued that digital documents do not&nbsp;disappear from the Web, but leave artifacts that can be&nbsp;used to reconstruct them (Klein et al., 2011). Bar-Yosseff et al. carried out experiments to measure the&nbsp;decay of the Web (Bar-Yossef et al., 2004). SalahEldeen&nbsp;determined that nearly 11% of shared resources will&nbsp;be lost one year after being published and that this&nbsp;decay will continue at a 0.02% rate per day&nbsp;(Salaheldeen and Nelson, 2012). Nevertheless, and&nbsp;despite these previous efforts, managing and&nbsp;characterizing change in online environments is a&nbsp;complex problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently, our research group has been focusing on analyzing the perceptions of change in distributed&nbsp;collections (Meneses et al., 2016b). However, we&nbsp;believe that the inherent characteristics of online&nbsp;digital humanities projects present an interesting (and&nbsp;unique) area for inquiry for two reasons. First, the&nbsp;research aspect of digital humanities projects hinders&nbsp;our previous approaches - as our methods for&nbsp;identifying change in the Web do not fully apply. And&nbsp;second, digital humanities projects have a limited&nbsp;useful life - which is accompanied by research from&nbsp;primary investigator, which may or may not be&nbsp;indicated by updates in the project’s content and tools.&nbsp;We have seen many cases of successful projects in&nbsp;digital humanities (that fulfill their original objectives&nbsp;and achieve their expected level functionality) that&nbsp;interestingly become abandoned at some point in&nbsp;time. Examples of abandoned successful projects&nbsp;include the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Cervantes Project</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">TAMU Herbaria&nbsp;Project</span><span class="font2">. This abandonment might be caused by a&nbsp;different set of reasons -which are not often apparent&nbsp;to its users- such as loss of funding, change in&nbsp;personnel or simply decay in interest. We believe that&nbsp;all these reasons are worthy of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All this reasoning led us to formulate the following question: When can online digital humanities projects&nbsp;be considered abandoned? In this paper, we propose&nbsp;to present a study on the persistence and average&nbsp;lifespan of online projects in the digital humanities.&nbsp;More specifically, we will elaborate on their reliance&nbsp;on distributed resources and methods for measuring&nbsp;their shelf life: the average length of time that a digital&nbsp;project can endure without updates until it can&nbsp;ultimately be considered abandoned by its researcher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, we believe that “abandonment” is not necessarily a sufficient designation —as there are&nbsp;different nuances involved. We will proceed to&nbsp;elaborate on them using one of our online projects as&nbsp;an example. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Digital Acting Parts</span><span class="font2"> is an online project&nbsp;that encourages active reading and memorization,&nbsp;which in turn leads to a better understanding of&nbsp;Shakespeare’s plays. The project has been active since&nbsp;2013, but online development has shifted to a set of&nbsp;different processes that are carried out behind the&nbsp;scenes. Consequently, the project’s online presence&nbsp;has not been updated for some time now (we estimate&nbsp;that it has been at least a year). However, the online&nbsp;tools are quite stable at this point. In this specific case,&nbsp;the lack of updates and new content is not a signal of&nbsp;abandonment. This is clear example of why the rules&nbsp;for traditional websites do not fully apply and new&nbsp;metrics are needed to identify issues concerning&nbsp;online projects in the digital humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our study is an attempt to categorize change in a very specific domain. As an attempt of categorization,&nbsp;determining the degree of abandonment affecting a&nbsp;digital project over time is a difficult task. A Web&nbsp;resource may gradually degrade from being correct to&nbsp;one that is still of some use by providing access to&nbsp;related information or information about the&nbsp;institution to contact for more information.&nbsp;Abandonment can also be hinted by changes in Web&nbsp;servers, directory structures, etc., which may cause&nbsp;Web requests to still result in a successful responses&nbsp;from a server, yet provide no valid information to the&nbsp;requestor. Based on our findings, we approximate the&nbsp;average shelf life to 5 years, which aligns with reports&nbsp;from previous work (Goh and Ng, 2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, our study will touch upon on potential strategies for the archival and the long-term&nbsp;preservation of abandoned digital online projects. It is&nbsp;important to highlight that different levels of&nbsp;preservation and curation are needed among digital&nbsp;projects. Historically, preservation efforts have been&nbsp;primarily concerned with maintaining the primary&nbsp;artifacts in collections; relegating descriptive&nbsp;metadata to a lesser level of importance. There is an&nbsp;underlying notion that descriptive metadata is static:&nbsp;requiring minimal resources to maintain and&nbsp;consequently making it easier to preserve. However,&nbsp;our previous work (Meneses et al., 2016b) has shown&nbsp;us that this is not the always the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To summarize, in this paper we propose to identify indicators of the abandonment of digital humanities&nbsp;projects - as well as identifying their average lifespan.&nbsp;Digital online projects in the humanities have unique&nbsp;characteristics that make them impervious to the&nbsp;metrics that used in the Web as a whole. In our&nbsp;opinion, these unique characteristics make them&nbsp;worthy of study. In the end, the purpose of our study&nbsp;is to gain a better understanding of digital humanities&nbsp;projects, their lifespan and formulate better strategies&nbsp;for their long-term preservation.</span></p>
