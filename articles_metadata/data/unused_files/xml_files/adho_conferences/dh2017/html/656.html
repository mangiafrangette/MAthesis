<p><span class="font2">In this half-day tutorial we will offer a full-fledged, implemented and tested workflow that has been developed in the interdisciplinary </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Center for Reflected</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Text Analytics</span><span class="font2"> (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">CRETA</span><span class="font2">, a research center connecting both scholars from Humanities/Social Sciences and&nbsp;Computational Linguistics at the University of&nbsp;Stuttgart). Our focus is the valid and reliable identification of various kinds of entities and segments from&nbsp;raw, un-annotated texts and the extraction of specific&nbsp;relational information via network visualizations.&nbsp;Given the recent interest in networks for data representation and visualization (e.g., Gephi-tutorial at DH&nbsp;2016), we argue that the following three-step-workflow is applicable to many research questions in the&nbsp;Social Sciences and Humanities:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detection of entity references in texts of different genres (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. references to chancellor&nbsp;Merkel in parliamentary debates)</span><span class="font2">,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segmentation of the texts guided by research&nbsp;questions (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. parts of a parliamentary&nbsp;speech dealing with the Greek financial crisis</span><span class="font2">),&nbsp;and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. Creation of networks of entities that co-occur within a segment </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. references to national or international organizations in a parliamentary debate dealing with the issue of&nbsp;wars and military interventions).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This workflow is one example of modularizing complex research questions into concrete steps and&nbsp;can moreover be combined with computational methods for the semi-automatic analysis of very large text&nbsp;corpora. The concepts of “entity” and “segment” are&nbsp;sufficiently generic to allow the same set of tools to be&nbsp;employed in different research questions originating&nbsp;from different fields of research. The tutorial is therefore not aimed at a specific Humanities or Social Sciences discipline and instead open to all researchers interested in the analysis of entity relations in large&nbsp;amounts of textual data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our tutorial we will make use of the web-based annotation tool CRETAnno developed to support&nbsp;semi-automatic annotation. CRETAnno provides tools&nbsp;for annotation and continuous assessmen</span><span class="font3">t </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inter-annotator agreement</span><span class="font2">, thereby facilitating the production&nbsp;of reliable and valid data. Our tool facilitates the annotation of large text corpora: After some training instances are annotated, a machine learning model can&nbsp;be trained to predict new instances on additional texts,&nbsp;which can then be corrected and used as additional&nbsp;training material. This way, large texts can be annotated (relatively) quickly, given systematic manual annotation and clear annotation guidelines.&nbsp;This 3-step&nbsp;approach is currently investigated within the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Center&nbsp;for Reflected Text Analytics</span><span class="font2"> (CRETA) on four distinct&nbsp;text corpora, connected to diverse research questions&nbsp;in different disciplines. Although establishing broadly&nbsp;applicable workflows has its merits (Kuhn &amp; Reiter,&nbsp;2015), we believe it is important to be able to “parameterise” them to take into account the specificities of a&nbsp;concrete research question. Research questions&nbsp;should govern the definition of entities, segments and&nbsp;weighting criteria in the network. In the tutorial, participants will be free to bring in (and work on) their&nbsp;own research questions (within the time limits of the&nbsp;tutorial).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Entity Reference Detection</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">Every concept of interest within a real or fictional world can be considered as an entity. Words in a text&nbsp;refer to th ese entities and are therefore called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">entity&nbsp;references</span><span class="font2">. We have established annotation guidelines&nbsp;that distinguish six entity classes, oriented at the research questions within CRETA: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Person</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Location</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Work</span><span class="font2"> (e.g., a piece of art), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Event</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abstract Concept</span><span class="font2"> (e.g., art).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While these entities are semantically diverse, their linguistic representation in texts is similar: References&nbsp;are either proper nouns (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hillary Clinton</span><span class="font2">/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">EU</span><span class="font2">), pronouns (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">she</span><span class="font2">/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font2">) or appellative noun phrases (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">an American politician</span><span class="font2"> / </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the international organisation</span><span class="font2">).Most of&nbsp;the entity references consist of a few words, but we&nbsp;generally opt for annotating full noun phrases (e.g., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the&nbsp;British people after having voted for the Brexit</span><span class="font2">). In order to be able to link entities semi-automatically, we&nbsp;focus on appellative noun phrases and proper nouns,&nbsp;and ignore pronouns (see below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The notion of “entity reference” we are aiming for differs from what is known in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Named Entity Recognition </span><span class="font2">(NER) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Coreference Resolution </span><span class="font2">(CR). In NER,&nbsp;only proper nouns are detected, while CR also aims to&nbsp;resolve pronouns. Our notion of entity reference detection is aiming for the middle ground. By excluding&nbsp;pronouns, we also exclude the most ambiguous words,&nbsp;whose co-reference properties typically can only be&nbsp;judged in context of their appearance. Appellative NPs&nbsp;contain enough information such that we can establish&nbsp;their identity with proper nouns with relatively simple&nbsp;lists and rules.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Text Segmentation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">Researchers from Humanities or Social Sciences generally want to inquire either the interaction between entities (within certain contexts) or between&nbsp;entities and the contexts themselves. Text segmentation is our way of operationalising this context.&nbsp;The&nbsp;notion of segment -- again -- is a generic one, to be&nbsp;adapted to specific research questions and/or theoretical assumptions made within a discipline or research&nbsp;area. Different kinds of segmentation are distinguishable: A </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">segmentation according to structural units&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">like chapters (narratives), speeches (minutes of parliamentary debates) or acts (dramatic texts) relies on&nbsp;the proper detection of such segments in the original&nbsp;texts and is therefore highly intertwined with the concrete text format at hand. Although machine learning&nbsp;models can be trained to perform such tasks, they&nbsp;likely do not generalize well to new texts. Even in TEI-encoded dramatic texts (which are strongly structured), there are a lot of options how to encode acts.&nbsp;We therefore aim for making it easy for researchers&nbsp;from Humanities and Social Sciences to detect such&nbsp;segments using metadata (e.g. dates of publication of a&nbsp;newspaper article or a parliamentary debate), text-specific regular expressions and/or rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A second kind of segmentation is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">segmentation according to content </span><span class="font2">criteria. Depending on text&nbsp;genre and research question, this can mean segmentation by topic, narrative level, plot, time, location etc.&nbsp;One possible application is the segmentation of newspaper content according to various topics (Kantner &amp;&nbsp;Overbeck 2017, forthcoming).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Structurally, segment annotations differ from entity reference annotations by being longer and thus sparser within a text. This has consequences for the&nbsp;semi-automatic support, because annotating a sufficient number of training instances requires more text&nbsp;to be read (and analysed with respect to its segmentation) and thus takes more time. CRETAnno therefore&nbsp;supports a number of unsupervised segmentation algorithms that can be used directly. In addition, researchers can specify text patterns using regular expressions and simple rules and thus focus the segmentation on the specific research question they have.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Entities + Segments = Networks</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Given entity reference and segment annotations, it is only a small step to extract network-like data based&nbsp;on co-occurrence. As the entity reference annotation&nbsp;does not include links between annotations referring&nbsp;to the same entity, we developed a small tool to mark&nbsp;co-reference, given the annotated entity references.&nbsp;Currently, this has to be done manually, but we will explore automatisation possibilities in the future. Given&nbsp;that we can already identify string-identical entity references automatically, it is a manageable workload.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CRETAnno offers an interface to the graph exploration</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">software </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Gephi</span><span class="font2">, which can be used to edit, explore, inspect and visualise the network (the tutorial covers the annotation, ex- and import, but only basic functionality of Gephi.).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tutorial</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">Participants will have the opportunity to work on texts of their own choosing within the first half of the&nbsp;workshop. To that end, they will be asked to submit&nbsp;their texts before the workshop. We will supply hands-on material to participants that do not submit. The tutorial focuses on hands-on sessions and active participation.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Appendix</span></h1>
