<p><span class="font3">The Linguistic DNA project (LDNA) is an AHRC-funded collaborative project (AHRC grant AH/M00614X/1) between the universities of Sheffield, Glasgow, and Sussex which is designing automatic processes to investigate the emergence and&nbsp;development of concepts in pre-1800 CE print. Employing Early English Books Online, manually-transcribed through the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Text Creation Partnership&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(EEBO-TCP) as its primary dataset, supplemented by&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Eighteenth Century Collections Online</span><span class="font3"> (ECCO-TCP)&nbsp;and other high-quality 18th-century text collections,&nbsp;the project is developing and refining a processing&nbsp;pipeline which assembles groupings of words bound&nbsp;together by their contextual use in printed discourse. The project is charting development of these&nbsp;discourse-embedded word groups across time, investigating how they are shaped by historical and literary contexts, the boundaries and overlap between&nbsp;the groupings, and the interaction of ‘encyclopedic'&nbsp;groupings with more traditional ‘thesaurus'-style semantic fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper discusses results from a branch of the project which is investigating incidences of rapid&nbsp;change in the size of semantic categories as represented in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Historical Thesaurus of English</span><span class="font3"> (Kay et&nbsp;al., 2016). Development of concepts through size of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> categories has been investigated previously (cf. Alexander and Struan, 2013; Jurgen-Diller,&nbsp;2014), although the extra dimension provided by the&nbsp;outputs of the LDNA processor allows a dramatic&nbsp;leap forward in such research by enabling identification of instances in which change in discourse-embedded word groupings acts as catalyst for corresponding rapid change in the semantic fields of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present case study investigates words relating to the concept of ‘virginity', utilising processed time-slice subsets of EEBO-TCP as snapshots of the&nbsp;discourse context for these words in Early Modern&nbsp;English print. By building sample word-groupings&nbsp;(the term ‘cluster' is here avoided to avoid confusion&nbsp;with cluster or network analysis word clusters) for&nbsp;each of the subsets, it establishes the discourse context of ‘virginity' words at different points in the&nbsp;timespan covered by EEBO-TCP. Comparison of&nbsp;these groupings suggests change in focus of language users, through which a largely religious context of use opens out to a secular and then a poetic&nbsp;literary context, suggesting that society's consciousness of this concept and the scale on which it was&nbsp;discussed enlarged dramatically in the period covered by the sub-corpora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to select a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> category for analysis, an average pattern of change over time&nbsp;was established. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> arranges the words&nbsp;of the English language into a semantic hierarchy&nbsp;that is seven category levels deep with the potential&nbsp;for up to four further sub-category levels within any&nbsp;given category. Owing to the incredibly fine-grained&nbsp;nature of the sense categorisation in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3">,&nbsp;it was necessary to ‘cut' the hierarchy at human scale</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">using a thematic category set, developed during the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AHRC- and ESRC-funded </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">SAMUELS project</span><span class="font3"> (Grant AH/L010062/1), which is intended to allow </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> users to find information at a level that is salient&nbsp;to human beings - i.e. neither too general nor too detailed.</span></p><img src="016_files/016-1.jpg" style="width:229pt;height:57pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: Sparkline showing growth of ‘Virginity' category from 1000 CE to 2000 CE in context of surrounding</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">thematic categories (which are themselves unusual as they are lexicalised only in later periods of English)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of lexemes within each category level was counted, and lexemes were filtered to include only those active within the approximate time&nbsp;range of the EEBO-TCP collection, i.e. 1475-1700 CE.&nbsp;This data was aggregated so that the change in the&nbsp;mean contents of a category could be viewed across&nbsp;time, and decade-to-decade percentage changes calculated. Individual categories were then compared&nbsp;to this average category change, and a deviation of&nbsp;more than 5% from the average change considered&nbsp;to be significant. Out of the categories which were&nbsp;marked as statistically unusual from this process,&nbsp;category ‘AI09g Virginity' was selected as promising&nbsp;because the items in its lexis had a relatively low&nbsp;number of homographs that could skew the results&nbsp;towards irrelevant information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Testing of the LDNA processor outputs is being conducted on select subsets extracted to provide&nbsp;snapshots across the EEBO time-period. The subsets&nbsp;used for this paper cover the periods 1520-39, 155059, 1610-11, and 1649. They are designed to contain&nbsp;a similar number of tokens; the progressively contracting timespans reflect the concomitant growth of&nbsp;printed material throughout the 15<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> centuries. Each token in the text is regularised, lemma-tised, and tagged with a NUPOS part of speech tag via&nbsp;the MorphAdorner pipeline developed by Martin&nbsp;Müller and Philip Burns (Burns, 2013). Data is then&nbsp;gathered by the LDNA processor for the token's cooccurrences within 100- and 200-word bi-directional windows which are intended to simulate paragraph-like sections of the proximate discourse (cf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fitzmaurice </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3"> forthcoming). Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is used to provide a statistic for&nbsp;likelihood of word co-occurrences; a minimum PMI&nbsp;value of 0.5 was arrived at experimentally for identifying node-collocate pairs to be considered interesting in initial stages of investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Seven items - ‘maid,’ ‘maiden,’ ‘maidenhead,’ ‘undefiled,’ ‘vestal,’ ‘virgin,’ and ‘virginity’ - in the ‘Virginity’ category were found to be present consistently across the subsets (although an eighth - ‘virginal’ - was present in the 1520-39 and 1610-11 subsets). The co-occurrences were then processed&nbsp;to identify those which occurred with multiple items&nbsp;in this list. Words which co-occurred with four or&nbsp;more items were investigated further.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Comparison of the co-occurrence results across the five text subsets shows a consistent shift in the&nbsp;patterns of word association with ‘Virginity’ category items. The words ‘woman’ and ‘widow’ remain&nbsp;strongly associated with the terms across all the subsets, demonstrating societal preoccupation with female rather than male virginity. The most evident&nbsp;change in the grouping is movement from a predominately religious discourse context into the secular&nbsp;world. In the 1520-39 subset, the Virgin Mary is intimately related to discussion of virginity. In the&nbsp;shared collocates listing, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mother</span><span class="font3"> collocates with all&nbsp;seven of the ‘Virginity’ lexemes, ‘mary’ with six, ‘angel,’ ‘bless,’ ‘hymn,’ ‘nativity,’ and ‘nazareth’ with five&nbsp;each. Of these, only ‘mother’ maintains a strong association with ‘Virginity’ words throughout the&nbsp;EEBO period, appearing with four items in the 161011 text set and five in 1649.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The secularisation of the term is suggested by the prevalence in later subsets of words relating to marriage, reflecting what appears to be a growing focus&nbsp;on wedlock being preceded by virginity. ‘Marry’&nbsp;gradually increases its association with the node&nbsp;items, collocating with four, then five, then seven&nbsp;from 1520 to 1649. ‘Marriage’ and ‘wife’ both enter&nbsp;the shared collocate group in 1550, and remain there&nbsp;through to 1649, whilst ‘matrimony’ is present in&nbsp;1550, drops out in 1610, and returns in 1649.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The extensive list of shared collocates in the 1649 sub-corpus strongly reflects the greater prevalence&nbsp;of literary fiction and poetry in printers’ output and&nbsp;reinforces that virginity is a topic for which the discourse context is expanding; where it was easy to intuitively group ‘marry,’ ‘marriage,’ and ‘wife’ together, the 1649 collocates do not form easily identifiable groupings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Discussion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The consistency of the core items found in the subsets is interesting in its disparity with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> data, where the increase in the number of&nbsp;terms present in the ‘Virginity’ category suggests</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that there should be an expanding number of items found throughout these subsets. The most likely explanation for this is loss of low frequency information through a combination of cut-off values intended to reduce noise for later clustering experiments, and difficulty in normalising/lemmatising&nbsp;low frequency items. A clear outcome of the analysis&nbsp;is the confirmation that the category of ‘Virginity'&nbsp;contains core vocabulary which remains almost unchanged in over a century (i.e. 1520-1649), primarily a consistent group of seven items which co-occur&nbsp;with ‘Virginity' category words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This study demonstrates that understanding of semantic development can be enriched by such&nbsp;cross-analysis of discursive-concept word groups&nbsp;with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> semantic fields and the word groups&nbsp;which travel through time with multiple items of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus</span><span class="font3"> categories.</span></p>
