<p><span class="font1">Copyright is controversial and murky. By any name, it refers to rights connected to original works.&nbsp;In some countries, emphasis is on the rights of authors&nbsp;or distributors of a work; in others, public good is&nbsp;given prominence. In most places it’s a combination of&nbsp;the two. Significant commercial and personal interests&nbsp;are involved, and the advent of the internet has&nbsp;redefined distribution; and so copyright laws are&nbsp;constantly changing. Although the notion of&nbsp;intellectual property exists in almost all countries its&nbsp;significance and actual implementation varies as does&nbsp;the degree to which the counter balancing rights of&nbsp;access to information are implemented and supported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In digital humanities, copyright is implicated in multiple ways. As with all scholarship, book and article&nbsp;publishing is fraught with rights transfers embedded&nbsp;in publishing contracts, and subsequent publisher&nbsp;practices that often impede scholarly progress. Other&nbsp;copyright issues are unique to DH. Who holds&nbsp;copyright to what part of a collaborative, web-based&nbsp;project? What is the difference, and what are the&nbsp;intersections, between having, protecting, and&nbsp;exercising legal rights on one hand, and being given&nbsp;proper credit on the other?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We propose a DH2017 panel to discuss these issues, with an eye toward helping DH practitioners&nbsp;make better informed decisions regarding the new&nbsp;knowledge they create. More importantly, though, we&nbsp;aim to spur a community conversation about&nbsp;copyright as an area in which digital humanists have&nbsp;agency as knowledge producers, not just as&nbsp;consumers. The rapid worldwide expansion of digital&nbsp;humanities work demands that we begin to deal with&nbsp;the complex tangle of rights around digital humanities&nbsp;knowledge production before others do it for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This conversation has not yet happened at the DH conference or in the field at large in a robust way.&nbsp;Copyright is mentioned usually as an issue around&nbsp;using third-party materials, an obstacle or a limitation&nbsp;for a particular project (Neuman, Greent, Unsworth&nbsp;1997; Evenson 1999; Lord 1999; Ben-Porat, Reich,&nbsp;Behrendt 2002). We were unable to locate conference&nbsp;abstracts that addressed copyright and intellectual&nbsp;property issues for the new knowledge produced.&nbsp;Workshop-type events on DH and copyright tend also&nbsp;to take a more applied approach, on how third-party&nbsp;copyright affects the project. Two related&nbsp;conversations are taking place, though. One is about&nbsp;labor in academe at large and in DH in particular&nbsp;(Keralis, Burgess and Hamming, Anderson et al,&nbsp;Flanders); the other is about access to knowledge as a&nbsp;social justice issue—what access to scholarship means&nbsp;in terms of power distribution, perpetuating systemic&nbsp;inequalities in academe and outside it (Risam et al,&nbsp;Chenier, Faull et al). We think that our panel will&nbsp;contribute to this conversation. Considering questions&nbsp;of labor from the perspective of rights to knowledge&nbsp;produced potentially clarifies, and makes more&nbsp;expansive, our collective notion of where labor exists&nbsp;in a digital humanities project. And, thinking of the&nbsp;knowledge we produce in terms of rights we possess&nbsp;to it highlights our agency as individual contributors.&nbsp;This enables us to consider whether our individual&nbsp;and collective practice around author rights promotes&nbsp;or impedes our work’s overall contribution to society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We envision this panel beginning with a 10-12 minute presentation from each panelist on the topics&nbsp;described below, followed by a discussion with the&nbsp;audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Isabel Galina Russell </span><span class="font1">will speak on the long tradition of Open Access publishing in Latin America&nbsp;and discuss how this may have impacted the way in&nbsp;which DH resources are produced, disseminated and&nbsp;published in this region. She will draw on examples of&nbsp;DH projects in the region and analyse the copyright&nbsp;situation, as well as present the results of&nbsp;conversations with DH creators and their attitudes&nbsp;and experiences with copyright in relation to their&nbsp;work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alex Gil </span><span class="font1">will address the intersection between shadow libraries, digital humanities, vendor databases&nbsp;and digital libraries. Departing from the research work&nbsp;of the Piracy Lab and the Group for Experimental&nbsp;Methods in the Humanities at Columbia University, Gil&nbsp;will argue that our burgeoning global, hybrid republic&nbsp;of letters is being shaped in specific ways by the&nbsp;relationship of specific sectors of society to intellectual&nbsp;property. In a sense, Gil argues, architectures of&nbsp;humanistic knowledge are being produced by these&nbsp;different sectors, where the end product may&nbsp;resemble each other, but in large part due to the work&nbsp;of intellectual property laws, the labor conditions and&nbsp;social impact are quite different. The talk will conclude&nbsp;with a series of proposals for future humanistic&nbsp;research in the burgeoning area of what Alan Liu calls&nbsp;&quot;critical infrastructure studies.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Padmini Ray Murray </span><span class="font1">will address how the global hegemonies of knowledge production, ownership and&nbsp;circulation are challenged by creation and&nbsp;consumption practices in India, as embodied by the&nbsp;landmark ruling of the Delhi High Court in 2016, which&nbsp;dismissed suits filed by three international publishers&nbsp;who alleged that the circulation of photocopied&nbsp;material was an infringement of copyright. This will&nbsp;contextualise Ray Murray’s consequent discussion of&nbsp;how both academic publishing and conventions of&nbsp;copyright are largely colonial legacies, and how this&nbsp;case marks a significant moment in the decolonisation&nbsp;of the Indian university and intellectual life. Ray&nbsp;Murray will demonstrate how practices in Indian&nbsp;language publishing might exemplify alternatives to&nbsp;dominant regimes, as well as how digital spaces and&nbsp;practices can and are already fostering an emergent&nbsp;model of humanities scholarship different than that&nbsp;found in the global North.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Vika Zafrin </span><span class="font1">will give a brief overview of the current state of copyright in the United States as it&nbsp;relates to academic work from both the&nbsp;consumer/reader/user and the creator/author points&nbsp;of view. She will touch on some struggles academic&nbsp;libraries face in the current scholarly publishing&nbsp;climate, and describe strategies some institutions have&nbsp;adopted to improve the situation, including open&nbsp;access policies and an access-oriented approach to&nbsp;stewardship of digital (or digitized) scholarly&nbsp;materials given to libraries for archival and&nbsp;preservation. Zafrin will compare the institution- and&nbsp;funding-agency-level approaches to open access&nbsp;generally taken in the U.S. to those seen in some&nbsp;European countries (and in Europe as a whole via the&nbsp;Europeana project), highlighting differences and&nbsp;comparing their effectiveness while taking account&nbsp;what is possible in the respective political and&nbsp;legislative climates. She will briefly discuss some&nbsp;representative collaborations between U.S.&nbsp;researchers and colleagues worldwide, and their&nbsp;treatment of rights issues. Finally, she will make some&nbsp;suggestions for resources DH practitioners can use to&nbsp;make decisions about rights claims and attribution in&nbsp;their projects.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
