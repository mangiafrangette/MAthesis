<p><span class="font1">The National Museum of Japanese History (NMJH) is using digital technology to establishing its core&nbsp;research project, Constructing Integrated Studies of&nbsp;Cultural and Research Resources. This project offers&nbsp;unique insight into a variety of studies and Japanese&nbsp;historical resources through multidisciplinary&nbsp;collaboration with universities, museums, and other&nbsp;institutes. This paper introduces the initial application&nbsp;of Linked Data and IIIF (International Image&nbsp;Interoperability Framework).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Researchers working in the humanities and sciences with a focus on history need to collaborate&nbsp;with their peers in relevant fields to produce more&nbsp;diversity and substance in academic data. The plan for&nbsp;a new academic field is to construct a “research&nbsp;circulation model” that links academic studies and&nbsp;resource information through advanced cooperative&nbsp;studies. Although institute resources encompass a&nbsp;wide variety of materials, the poor quality of the&nbsp;current infrastructure has hampered researchers’&nbsp;access to original data and convenience in producing&nbsp;the primary evidence for research results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The number of researchers specializing in the study of China, Korea, and Taiwan is increasing due to&nbsp;the rapid growth in the networks of historical resource&nbsp;information in these countries. In contrast, the&nbsp;number of their peers in Japan is decreasing, in part&nbsp;because of Japan’s non-digitized and partially closed&nbsp;systems. This trend is particularly apparent in the&nbsp;younger generation, which is accustomed to using the&nbsp;internet. In our poster, we show an example of our&nbsp;collaborative studies with relevant local and&nbsp;international institutes. The name authorities and&nbsp;concept label authorities in the translation are related&nbsp;to the entities mentioned in the RDF (Resource&nbsp;Description Framework). In addition to preservation&nbsp;of data in the case of disaster, the poster presents our&nbsp;development of a support system in the affected areas&nbsp;and an advanced sharing infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RDF is a de facto standard since it is easy to add and edit metadata. It also enables the addition of multiple&nbsp;metadata to a single data element. Giving each&nbsp;resource its own address produces a permanent link&nbsp;to permanent data. This is an advantage for any&nbsp;researcher or institute that uses the data as an&nbsp;academic resource. Linking one resource to multiple&nbsp;relevant resources enables one to find information&nbsp;resources consecutively, as well as resources followed&nbsp;by historical studies. Research results must refer to&nbsp;original resources. In addition to fundamental data,&nbsp;division of systems and RDF can share complex data&nbsp;and advanced applications. Our RDF-based prototype&nbsp;is currently being tested, but it can connect internal&nbsp;and external databases by linking their URLs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To achieve the current results from resources in Japan, we also constructed an initial application of&nbsp;Linked Data and IIIF. It has five features. First, each&nbsp;resource has its one own address, which enables&nbsp;access to its resources from Google and other search&nbsp;engine results. Second, the application can access&nbsp;resources that follow another resource, such as a&nbsp;resource ^an institute another resource. Third, for&nbsp;smart device applications, spatial information is added&nbsp;to the resources. Fourth, the system and the data are&nbsp;separate. If a system is replaced or updated in the&nbsp;future, the data should remain usable. If an institute&nbsp;provides infrastructure data, other institutes or&nbsp;researchers can use the data to create applications. In&nbsp;doing so, the access path to the institute needs to be&nbsp;confirmed. Finally, RDF data are applied to the&nbsp;database.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are currently implementing all the functions and testing for real data, including 150,000 triples of&nbsp;our museum collection, 20,000 triples of related de&nbsp;facto data, and approximately 500 IIIF images. We&nbsp;plan to integrate the data sets of other Japanese&nbsp;universities by August 2017, and the application will&nbsp;be fully launched at the beginning of 2018.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here, we discuss links using Ukiyo-e of Japan. The Ukiyo-e material enables access to information&nbsp;concerning its holding institute as well as access to&nbsp;other collections. Its spatial information is also added&nbsp;to the resources. If, for example, Mt. Fuji is drawn on&nbsp;the Ukiyo-e, this application can show its spatial&nbsp;information. The application also connects to image</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">data using IIIF (providing both Image API and Presentation API) from RDF data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are now constructing a system to connect information about the Ukiyo-e artist to information&nbsp;about his work. Some of these links include metadata,&nbsp;such as FOAF (Friend of a Friend) in the information&nbsp;about people, and other links use vocabulary defined&nbsp;by our project.</span></p>
