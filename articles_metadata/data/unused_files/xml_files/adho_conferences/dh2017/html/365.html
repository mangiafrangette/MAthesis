<p><span class="font1">We propose a discussion of the pedagogical process and representational implications of our digital&nbsp;project, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Red Record. The Red Record</span><span class="font1"> is an open-ended, ongoing project created using </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">DH Press</span><span class="font1"> that&nbsp;situates historic American lynchings, starting with&nbsp;those that took place in North Carolina, on a Cartesian&nbsp;map. In its current state the project offers primary&nbsp;source documentation and scholar-produced context&nbsp;for each of the 112 lynching events, which took the&nbsp;lives of 147 people in the state between 1865 and&nbsp;1941. The initial project was undertaken by a seminar&nbsp;of first year students at the University of North&nbsp;Carolina, and subsequently amended with the&nbsp;research of two additional undergraduate classes. In&nbsp;the session proposed here, we detail the process of&nbsp;research and the intertwined workflow that&nbsp;simultaneously teaches students primary research&nbsp;skills and forces them to confront the legacies of racial&nbsp;violence inherent in the landscapes they live in. We&nbsp;suggest that the pedagogical model of this project has&nbsp;broader implications for the ways that digital&nbsp;representations might seek to engage diverse&nbsp;populations in understanding and contributing to the&nbsp;knowledge of the places they are from. In the papers&nbsp;here, we consider both the implications of digital&nbsp;representations of lynching, and the possibilities and&nbsp;practical obstacles in extending this project through&nbsp;student and community crowdsourcing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Until recently, North Carolina has enjoyed a reputation as a less objectionable southern state,&nbsp;whether as a “vale of humility” between the less&nbsp;commendable Virginia and South Carolina, or as a&nbsp;“business progressive” southern state, concerned&nbsp;enough about outside investment to control its&nbsp;citizens’ worst impulses. The problem of lynching,&nbsp;widely studied in states such as Georgia and Virginia,&nbsp;has received less attention from North Carolina’s&nbsp;scholars: the only monograph on the subject is a&nbsp;summary-study our research found to contain a&nbsp;number of errors. Visual scholarship on the subject is&nbsp;limited. In 2000, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Without Sanctuary,</span><span class="font1"> a gruesome&nbsp;collection of lynching postcards, opened in New York&nbsp;and was soon followed by </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">a website</span><span class="font1"> which still exists&nbsp;but which shows its age. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Without Sanctuary</span><span class="font1"> was and is&nbsp;an important project, one that shocked viewers as to&nbsp;the extent of historical violence. Yet today, as we&nbsp;regularly witness violence against persons of color on&nbsp;social media or television news, we must wonder&nbsp;about troubling side effects of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Without Sanctuary:</span><span class="font1"> that&nbsp;in presenting lynchings as sepia-toned horrors of the&nbsp;past, it appeared to relegate such violence to history&nbsp;and allow for a self-satisfied reassurance that this time&nbsp;had passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such is the challenge for any project addressing historical trauma. Adding to this concern are&nbsp;questions of representation. In uncritically presenting&nbsp;images of lynchings, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Without Sanctuary</span><span class="font1"> risked&nbsp;reproducing the work of those postcards, which&nbsp;traveled the country presenting damaged black bodies&nbsp;that titillated as much as it horrified, and even in their&nbsp;extremity regularized and commodified anti-Black&nbsp;violence. We know that lynchings themselves echoed&nbsp;across generations in Black communities (Wolf, 1992)&nbsp;did </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Without Sanctuary</span><span class="font1"> address that trauma or amplify&nbsp;it? Do the victims of lynchings have, in a sense, the&nbsp;right to be forgotten? (Causey, 2015) In pursuing&nbsp;Locating Lynching, we remained aware of these risks&nbsp;and encountered still more: how to choose visual&nbsp;anchors for our display, whether or not to publish&nbsp;images of trauma, how to share accounts of lynchings&nbsp;from the white and Black presses without false&nbsp;equivalence, what kinds of information to include&nbsp;about persons who do not deserve to be remembered&nbsp;only as victims. Our panel will address these issues in&nbsp;detail, share our solutions, and explain our next steps&nbsp;as we continue to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A key element of our project and our panel is pedagogy, both in terms of engaging undergraduate&nbsp;students with digital, primary-source research and in&nbsp;terms of engaging them with a traumatic subject. It is&nbsp;the rare undergraduate student, particularly in a&nbsp;seminar designed for first-year students, who is well-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">equipped to conduct original research. But with the recent digitization of hundreds of thousands of pages&nbsp;of small-town newspapers, of censuses from the 19th&nbsp;and early 20th centuries, and of city directories and&nbsp;historic maps, the hidden histories of lynchings, their&nbsp;victims, and their perpetrators have never been more&nbsp;visible. As historians, we can and have learned stories&nbsp;from the darkened margins: We have learned the story&nbsp;a young man who escaped a lynching attempt and fled&nbsp;the state, ending up, married and with a son, as a&nbsp;doorman in the United Nations building in Manhattan.&nbsp;We have learned the names of the white men who&nbsp;kidnapped from jail an African American man jailed on&nbsp;a rape accusation and hanged him. We know these&nbsp;people’s addresses, their occupations, the names of&nbsp;their parents and children. In both these marginal&nbsp;stories, and in the aggregating potential of digital&nbsp;visualizations, we can tell some small part of the&nbsp;abbreviated life stories of these people, albeit in the&nbsp;context of their deaths. Teaching undergraduate&nbsp;students the process whereby they can make these&nbsp;discoveries - as detailed in our nine-page </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">research&nbsp;guide</span><span class="font1"> - can be transformative. We ask our students,&nbsp;who are awash in digital representation and&nbsp;misrepresentation, to carefully consider their choices&nbsp;in saving, commenting on, and presenting past&nbsp;identities.</span></p>
