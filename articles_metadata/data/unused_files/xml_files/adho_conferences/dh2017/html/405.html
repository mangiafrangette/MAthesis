<p><span class="font3">Until recently, discussions about geographies, cartographies, space and place in Digital Humanities have taken place under the umbrella of the subfield generally known as the ‘Spatial Humanities'. During last&nbsp;year's DH 2016 conference at Krakow and particularly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">at the workshop ‘</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">A Place for Places</span><span class="font3">: Current trends</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and challenges in the development and use of geo-historical gazetteers', an exciting but not often discussed challenge started to emerge as an issue of clear importance: How can we, through spatial technologies&nbsp;and computational approaches address places and&nbsp;spaces that are non-geographical? This is to say, places&nbsp;that are vague or imaginary and that cannot be&nbsp;mapped or related to coordinates? Can we argue that&nbsp;there is a clear distinction between what could be&nbsp;called the Geo-humanities and the Spatial Humanities?&nbsp;Is there a need for this division? And more importantly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How can we move towards a holistic analysis of space and place in Digital Humanities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Building from Lefevre's original proposition that our understanding of space and place changes with&nbsp;time and culture, humanists addressing questions related to space and time in Literature, History and Archaeology among other fields, must engage in the reflection of what constitute a place in the cultures, narratives, documents, data, and evidence they examine.&nbsp;As such, the field of Spatial Humanities despite its undoubtful success in the creation of innovative methods&nbsp;using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other&nbsp;approaches, it has focused primarily on the investigation of geographic or ‘mappable' places (Moretti 1999;&nbsp;Cooper and Gregory 2011; Murrieta-Flores et al 2015;&nbsp;Heuser et al 2016; Stadler et al 2016). Several scholars,&nbsp;particularly from literary fields, have addressed the&nbsp;importance of the gap left by the lack of research of&nbsp;these ‘other' kind of places with DH methodologies,&nbsp;partially due to the fact that from the Humanities, they&nbsp;are the ones that deal with imaginary places and also&nbsp;due to the strong research that is carried out in terms&nbsp;of spatial narratives within Literary Geography (Piatti&nbsp;2009; Saunders 2010, 2016; Jockers 2013; Bushell&nbsp;2016). Nevertheless, a similar question can be posed&nbsp;in the case of historical documents. Although one&nbsp;wouldn't expect to encounter imaginary places in an&nbsp;historical text, many historical documents often deal&nbsp;with vague spaces, or a combination of vague and locational place. Furthermore, literary documents of historical nature such as medieval romances, but also fiction among other genres, can also deal with a combination of geographical, vague, and imaginary places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking to address this issue and taking as example a corpus of the five French medieval romances written&nbsp;by Chretien de Troyes during the 12 <sup>th</sup> century, we designed a basic methodology using a combination of&nbsp;Corpus Linguistics and spatial technologies to investigate all sorts of place and space (Murrieta-Flores and&nbsp;Howell, 2017-forthcoming). While the first experiment with this methodology was simply exploratory,&nbsp;it allowed us in a first instance to identify and extract&nbsp;places that are geographic, vague and imaginary from&nbsp;the texts, and to analyse these in relation to their context and other keywords of our interest. More recently,&nbsp;we started a second phase of experimentation that is&nbsp;allowing us to compare real, vague and imaginary&nbsp;places between different stories, traditions, and languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Using this methodology and this particularly rich case study, this talk will aim to spark the reflection and&nbsp;hopefully discussion about (a) the theoretical challenges that conceptions of space and place pose in different disciplines, (b) the possible methodological solutions to these questions, and (c) the future directions&nbsp;of the field of Spatial Humanities.</span></p>
