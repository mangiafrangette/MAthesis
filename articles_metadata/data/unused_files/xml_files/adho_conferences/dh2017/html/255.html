<p><span class="font5">This panel brings together papers by three projects that are working on digital methods for researching&nbsp;and representing the textual networks of women&nbsp;writers. “Documentary Social Networks: Women&nbsp;Travel Writers in Prosopographies,” by Alison Booth&nbsp;with Worthy Martin, Rennie Mapp, and Jeremy Boggs,&nbsp;focuses on a cohort of travel writers from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Collective Biographies of Women project to consider documentary social networks and the “sibling”&nbsp;relationship of subjects who occupy a single&nbsp;biographical volume. “Intertextual Networks:&nbsp;Theorizing and Encoding Textual Connections in Early&nbsp;Women’s Writing,” by Sarah Connell and Julia&nbsp;Flanders, presents the Women Writers Project’s&nbsp;(WWP) work on using markup to model and research&nbsp;the citation and quotation practices of early women&nbsp;writers in the context of the larger ecology of digital&nbsp;projects focused on gender. “Digital Representation,&nbsp;Intertextual Relationships, and the Impact of Early&nbsp;Modern Women’s Writing,” by Marie-Louise Coolahan&nbsp;and David Kelly, describes the research of the RECIRC&nbsp;project (The Reception and Circulation of Early&nbsp;Modern Women’s Writing: 1550-1700), focusing on&nbsp;RECIRC’s development of taxonomies of reception and&nbsp;circulation and on the methodologies for&nbsp;understanding textual transmission that the project&nbsp;has been testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These projects explore the problem of intertextuality at several different levels: primary&nbsp;source documents (including print and manuscript),&nbsp;metadata, and synthetic or critical narratives such as&nbsp;biography and annotation. Each project faces the&nbsp;challenges particular to its own place in the digital&nbsp;ecology and also the challenge of making its data&nbsp;usable in other parts of that ecology: connections that&nbsp;will depend on the collaborative generation of digital&nbsp;standards. The projects also share an interest in&nbsp;understanding the roles that gender played in the&nbsp;circulation of texts, investigating what women read&nbsp;and cited, which women were read and cited, and how&nbsp;women were represented in writing. Together they&nbsp;offer an opportunity to explore how intertextuality, as&nbsp;understood in the context of the modern web of linked&nbsp;open data, operates not only as a deliberate rhetoric of&nbsp;quotation but also through more complex&nbsp;interconnections between texts, authors, and other&nbsp;cultural agencies—and how those links can effectively&nbsp;be brokered through connections between digital&nbsp;research projects and resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These three papers will not only discuss the various textual networks of women writers that are&nbsp;the subject of their individual projects but will also&nbsp;consider connections between the projects&nbsp;themselves, highlighting both points of contact and&nbsp;distinctions. We see this panel as an opportunity to&nbsp;examine the wider possibilities for making&nbsp;intertextual connections legible among digital systems&nbsp;of textual circulation.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Documentary Social Networks: Women Travel Writers in Prosopographies</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alison Booth with Worthy Martin, Rennie</span></h2><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mapp, and Jeremy Boggs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">New literary histories using large digitized corpora can scale up the longstanding interest in&nbsp;intertextuality, beyond allusions and acknowledged&nbsp;influences. Such projects as the Women Writers&nbsp;Project and RECIRC engage not only textual but also&nbsp;personographic data, as all kinds of metadata&nbsp;interdependently form rigorous measures of&nbsp;intertextual transmission. As feminist literary history,&nbsp;such projects are also committed to contexts of&nbsp;women's lives and networks of representation. The&nbsp;Collective Biographies of Women (CBW) project&nbsp;studies Anglophone prosopographies (collective&nbsp;biographies, or a quantitative approach to&nbsp;standardized lives in sets) women of all occupations in&nbsp;books published since 1830, revealing trends in&nbsp;representation of women through an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">annotated&nbsp;bibliography,</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">database</span><span class="font5"> and stand-aside XML markup&nbsp;of narrative structure and discourse (Biographical Elements and Structure Schema, or </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">BESS</span><span class="font5"> a stand-aside&nbsp;XML schema for marking elements of biographical&nbsp;narratives at the level of the paragraph). Unlike many&nbsp;feminist DH projects, CBW is not an archive of&nbsp;women's creative writing, though at least 700 of 8700&nbsp;persons in the database are writers (one person is&nbsp;likely to represent several types). We study the&nbsp;collocation of women in books; thus Harriet&nbsp;Martineau, in 25 collections, is a “sibling” in “one&nbsp;degree of separation” from the 316 individuals found&nbsp;at least once in those collections. We have begun with&nbsp;typological cohorts and sample corpora focused on a&nbsp;nodal woman (all the volumes in which her biography&nbsp;appears) because of the labor-intensive analysis in our&nbsp;project's design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This talk introduces the cohort of travel writers in CBW, focusing on the sample corpus of volumes that&nbsp;include a short biography of the famous mother and&nbsp;travel writer Frances Trollope (CBW includes 10&nbsp;books entirely of female travelers; 17 collections of&nbsp;great mothers or mothers of the great. It should be&nbsp;noted that CBW assigns 137 collection types- e.g.&nbsp;genre; theme; types of women in them- and the 1272&nbsp;volumes may each be assigned more than one type).&nbsp;Her biography joins assortments of different types:</span></p><img src="255_files/255-1.jpg" style="width:218pt;height:169pt;"/>
<p><span class="font5">One exemplary text for this paper will be Una Pope-Hennessy's Three Englishwomen in America (London: Benn, 1929), on Frances Trollope (for an earlier&nbsp;account of Frances Trollope as travel writer and&nbsp;mother, see Booth, 2015), Harriet Martineau, and&nbsp;Fanny Kemble, to illustrate the concept of&nbsp;documentary social networks and the “siblings” who&nbsp;occupy a single volume. More recently, we study the&nbsp;author of such a collection, in the cohort of some 995&nbsp;“presenters” (i.e. biographers, illustrators, editors),&nbsp;567 of whom were female. Currently, the CBW&nbsp;database relates an author such as Pope-Hennessy&nbsp;only to the book, not to the persons associated with its&nbsp;chapters. We would like to visualize the relations&nbsp;among authors and their subjects as well as we already&nbsp;trace intertextual exchange among versions of the&nbsp;same lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">famous observations on America in the 1830s, adapted as frontispieces, take on a family resemblance&nbsp;in spite of the great social and personal distance&nbsp;among these mutual acquaintances. Covers and illustrations often create composite portraits (see Booth,&nbsp;2004:33-42) Pope-Hennessy's Englishwomen had&nbsp;bestselling books or tours in the 1830s, warranting&nbsp;their then-fashionable portraits (Cecil Beaton&nbsp;photographed Pope-Hennessy). Whereas Trollope and&nbsp;Kemble, and Martineau and Kemble, only coincide in&nbsp;Three Englishwomen in America, Martineau and&nbsp;Trollope share 8 collections, 3 on travelers, others on&nbsp;more miscellaneous achievement. What common&nbsp;ground justifies narratives of their lives in a single&nbsp;publication? Pope-Hennessy's title suggests it is their&nbsp;gendered transatlantic vision. It does not spell out that&nbsp;these Victorian writers attacked America for its&nbsp;manners and for slavery. CBW finds distinctive&nbsp;features in lives of women writers who traveled,&nbsp;besides an increase in geospatial data: a publication&nbsp;event characterizes and types the author (“Trollopize”&nbsp;is the verb the came from Trollope's offensive&nbsp;Domestic Manners of the Americans); literary&nbsp;biographies devote a high proportion of paragraphs to&nbsp;summary of the works, in contrast with biographies of&nbsp;queens or nurses, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Databases tend to label persons by nationality and familial role. Our research shows the temporal or&nbsp;narrative dimension of supposedly fixed traits as well&nbsp;as the unstable scope of events. Englishness (the event&nbsp;“birth”) should be modified by later adopted&nbsp;countries; Trollope and Kemble emigrated to the US&nbsp;for some years, and both primarily resided in Italy in&nbsp;later life. Married mothers, novelist Trollope and&nbsp;actress Kemble later separated or divorced; political&nbsp;theorist Martineau was unmarried and childless; these&nbsp;relations shape their representation. Many events&nbsp;challenge the researcher to affix GIS or standard dates,&nbsp;such as the bankruptcies (tied to family relations) that&nbsp;enabled all three writing careers; these crises had far-reaching continuance in creating their opportunities&nbsp;or need to travel. We have identified the most&nbsp;frequently narrated events in all versions of the three&nbsp;writers' lives, potentially mapping their travels,&nbsp;works, and lives in a way adaptable for any&nbsp;intertextual biographical cohort (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">http: //cbw.iath.virginia.edu/cbw db /events.phpl</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Intertextual Networks is an initiative of the Women Writers Project (WWP) at Northeastern University&nbsp;aimed at exploring and theorizing the representation&nbsp;of intertextuality, with a focus on the citation and&nbsp;quotation practices of the authors represented in the&nbsp;WWP’s digital collection, Women Writers Online&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">(WWO)</span><span class="font5">. The WWP’s work on Intertextual Networks&nbsp;incorporates several strands: focused projects&nbsp;conducted by individual research collaborators;&nbsp;sustained examination of the modalities of&nbsp;intertextuality as revealed by the work of our staff and&nbsp;collaborators; and a large-scale encoding project&nbsp;creating a bibliography of all the texts named or&nbsp;quoted in WWO, linking the texts in that bibliography&nbsp;with their occurrences in the WWO corpus, and&nbsp;substantially expanding the encoding of intertextual&nbsp;phenomena in our textbase. In this paper, we will&nbsp;discuss the aims and methods of the project, offering&nbsp;models for encoding complex intertextual features&nbsp;and setting out some processes for the systematic&nbsp;application of additional markup to an existing corpus.&nbsp;We will also consider the implications of this project&nbsp;for the larger ecology of digitized collections focused&nbsp;on gender and on women’s writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Contexts</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While Intertextual Networks is a recent initiative of the WWP, it has grown out of several decades of&nbsp;previous research as manifested in WWO and other&nbsp;WWP publications-particularly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Women Writers in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Review</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> a collection of around 700 reviews and publication notices responding to the authors in&nbsp;WWO. The almost 400 texts published in Women&nbsp;Writers Online are primarily print English-language&nbsp;works, representing a broad cross-section of texts&nbsp;written and translated by women from 1526 to 1850.&nbsp;These texts have been transcribed and encoded using&nbsp;the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines.&nbsp;Intertextual Networks also builds on and contributes&nbsp;to ongoing research into the digital representation of&nbsp;intertextuality, including the substantial work already&nbsp;evident in the TEI Guidelines’ recommendations for&nbsp;encoding titles, quotations, and other textual&nbsp;references. Additionally, we are working with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Orlando Project’s</span><span class="font5"> (see also, Brown et al, 2004) and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">RECIRC</span><span class="font5"> project’s (The Reception and Circulation of&nbsp;Early Modern Women’s Writing, 1550-1700) bodies&nbsp;of research into developing taxonomies of reception,&nbsp;circulation, and intertextuality. Intertextual Networks&nbsp;is equally grounded in literary and historical&nbsp;scholarship on the ways that women from the early&nbsp;modern period to the mid-nineteenth century read&nbsp;and responded to texts (e.g., Horrocks, 2008;&nbsp;Rumbold, 2006; Winterer, 2008).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Design and goals</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This project is working to create a much clearer and more textured picture of the rhetoric of&nbsp;intertextuality: what female authors read; what they&nbsp;felt it important to quote, paraphrase, or cite; and what&nbsp;mechanisms connect their writing to that of other&nbsp;authors. In addition to the relatively straightforward&nbsp;instances of explicit quotations, citations, and&nbsp;references to specific titles, the project is also invested&nbsp;in developing practices for marking up subtler forms&nbsp;of intertextual engagement that emerge from verbal&nbsp;echoes, stylistic or topic similarities, imitation, parody,&nbsp;and other transformative ways of responding to what&nbsp;one has read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because WWO is chronologically broad and generically diverse, it provides a considerable range of&nbsp;opportunities to test different encoding practices&nbsp;against textual exemplars. The textual references in&nbsp;WWO are often densely layered and quite complex—&nbsp;for just a few examples, Lady Eleanor Davies inserts&nbsp;the full text of other documents into some of her&nbsp;political pamphlets; the 1706 Ladies’ Diary constructs&nbsp;short poems, called “Enigmas,” out of lines from&nbsp;several other poetic works; and Elizabeth Craven’s&nbsp;1789 A Journey through the Crimea to Constantinople&nbsp;inserts a poem that she wrote based on, and&nbsp;sometimes “literally translated” from a pamphlet, with&nbsp;citations to the pamphlet itself (43). Thus, an&nbsp;important goal of this project is not only to reveal early&nbsp;women’s intertextual practices but also to test and&nbsp;model methods for representing the considerable&nbsp;complexity of these practices in TEI markup, working&nbsp;with formal categories without flattening out useful&nbsp;levels of nuance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Encoding and bibliographic development</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In developing a bibliography for the texts named in WWO, we have found that a balance of programmatic&nbsp;intervention and human attention can effectively&nbsp;accomplish systematic adjustments across our corpus.&nbsp;Using XQuery, we have generated a spreadsheet with&nbsp;the distinct titles—and authorship details where they&nbsp;are available—referenced in WWO. The WWP’s&nbsp;encoding staff has been gathering basic publication&nbsp;details (standardized titles, authors, and dates and&nbsp;locations of initial publication), removing duplicates,&nbsp;disambiguating wherever necessary—such as with&nbsp;the many texts that are titled “Poems”—and adding&nbsp;unique identifiers. Our bibliographic data follow Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)&nbsp;recommendations. Preserving the titles as they are&nbsp;represented in WWO, with the XPaths used to locate&nbsp;each, means that we can automatically add the unique&nbsp;identifiers back into the corpus when we have&nbsp;completed the initial bibliographic work. This&nbsp;approach enables us to identify the more than 6,000&nbsp;&lt;title&gt; elements in WWO relatively quickly, while&nbsp;ensuring from the outset that there are no duplicate&nbsp;entries and laying the groundwork for the future&nbsp;additions of texts and textual details as we expand our&nbsp;source identification to quotations and other textual&nbsp;references.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have also found that human and programmatic intervention can be fruitfully combined in establishing&nbsp;and implementing methods for encoding those&nbsp;intertextual features that are not straightforward&nbsp;&lt;quote&gt;s and &lt;title&gt;s and in expanding our&nbsp;understanding of how quotations and titles are being&nbsp;used by the authors in WWO. XPath and XQuery can&nbsp;reveal usage patterns and identify cases that might&nbsp;warrant additional investigation—such as the&nbsp;relatively rare instances in which titles are named in&nbsp;dramatic verse. Corpus-wide queries are also useful in&nbsp;locating additional examples of textual phenomena in&nbsp;order to decide how best to encode them. For example,&nbsp;we have reviewed emendations and translations of&nbsp;quotations, indirect references to titles, instances in&nbsp;which textual materials are elided from quotations,&nbsp;quotations within quotations, and incorrect or&nbsp;partially correct citations to develop consistent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">encoding practices that are applicable across our corpus, despite its variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This project is concerned with both discovering textual reverberation (the traces of women’s reading&nbsp;that emerge in their writing) and with making that&nbsp;reverberation legible within the new digital systems of&nbsp;textual circulation. Within the boundaries of the&nbsp;Women Writers Project, that legibility is effected&nbsp;through the encoding that makes intertextuality an&nbsp;explicit feature of our modeling of texts. The use of a&nbsp;community standard like the TEI and the future&nbsp;availability of an API to the project’s data extend that&nbsp;legibility—in principle—beyond the project’s walls,&nbsp;but these methods do not in themselves build the&nbsp;complex web of interconnections that would&nbsp;constitute digital intertextuality. By placing the&nbsp;WWP’s work alongside that of Collective Biographies&nbsp;of Women and RECIRC (two out of a much wider field&nbsp;of relevant connections) this panel will suggest what&nbsp;that larger intertextuality could look like, and what&nbsp;further work would be needed to realize it.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Digital Representation, Intertextual</span></h1><h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Relationships, and the Impact of Early Modern Women's Writing</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marie-Louise Coolahan and David Kelly</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This paper emerges from the research of the team working on the RECIRC project (The Reception and&nbsp;Circulation of Early Modern Women’s Writing, 15501700; see <a href="http://www.recirc.nuigalway.ie">www.recirc.nuigalway.ie</a>), funded by the&nbsp;European Research Council (2014-2019) and led by&nbsp;Marie-Louise Coolahan. It will describe the project, its&nbsp;development of digital tools, collaborations, and plans&nbsp;for interoperability with cognate projects. It will focus&nbsp;in particular on our development of taxonomies of&nbsp;reception and circulation, designed to capture data&nbsp;that reflects early modern source material, as the basis&nbsp;for our dialogue with the Women Writers Project and&nbsp;Collective Biographies of Women project - a dialogue&nbsp;that is centrally concerned with questions of&nbsp;intertextuality, circulation and the collaborative&nbsp;generation of digital standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The RECIRC project is essentially a study of intellectual impact. Its fundamental research&nbsp;questions include: Which women were read? How,&nbsp;where, and by whom were they read? RECIRC is&nbsp;structured around four interlinking ‘work packages’,&nbsp;each of which takes a specific entry point in order to&nbsp;amass quantitative data relating to the reception and&nbsp;circulation of women’s writing between 1550 and&nbsp;1700. The first of these posits the Catholic religious&nbsp;orders as transnational channels by which devotional&nbsp;and polemical texts were translated and transmitted;&nbsp;it investigates the martyrologies and bibliographies of&nbsp;the various religious orders, as large-scale compendia&nbsp;of texts that included female-authored works. The&nbsp;second ‘work package’ examines scientific&nbsp;correspondence networks (and therefore also&nbsp;complements the research currently brought under&nbsp;the umbrella of Women’s/Early Modern Letters&nbsp;Online (EMLO, WEMLO) and Reassembling the&nbsp;Republic of Letters (led by Howard Hotson); the&nbsp;wealth of data to be found in the scriptorium operated&nbsp;through Samuel Hartlib has meant we have focused&nbsp;specifically on this circle. The third approach aims to&nbsp;rebalance the bias of digitization projects toward print&nbsp;culture by harvesting data from early modern&nbsp;manuscripts. It does so by focusing solely on the&nbsp;category of the manuscript miscellany (a compilation&nbsp;of miscellaneous materials) in order to assess the&nbsp;contexts for excerpting and transcribing women’s&nbsp;writing. It differs from the Folger Shakespeare&nbsp;Library’s Early Modern Manuscripts Online (EMMO)&nbsp;initiative, which is a full-text transcription project, in&nbsp;its harvesting and structuring of data relating&nbsp;specifically to reception and circulation. The fourth&nbsp;RECIRC approach is concerned with early modern&nbsp;library catalogues; it captures data on the proportion&nbsp;of female-authored items in order to facilitate&nbsp;statistical analysis relating to the gendering of such&nbsp;book collections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RECIRC, then, is testing these methodological approaches for understanding the ‘big picture’ of&nbsp;textual transmission, reception and circulation of&nbsp;women’s writing in the sixteenth and seventeenth&nbsp;centuries. The focus on women’s writing enables&nbsp;investigation of the routes to impact that were&nbsp;exploited by early modern women, as well as of the&nbsp;ways gender inflected the construction of writerly&nbsp;reputation. It also delimits the corpus, facilitating our&nbsp;testing of methodologies for studying the circulation&nbsp;of non-elite, non-canonical writing in the period.&nbsp;Rather than producing a full-text digitization of&nbsp;primary materials, the project has been centrally&nbsp;concerned with developing taxonomies of reception&nbsp;and circulation - and these are the basis of&nbsp;collaboration with the WWP's current Intertextual&nbsp;Networks project and the Collective Biographies of&nbsp;Women project. This encompasses productive&nbsp;conversations around the kinds of intertextuality&nbsp;(quotation, excepting, citation of text and/or author)&nbsp;that occur in relation to women’s writing, and their&nbsp;modes of digital representation. There are also&nbsp;important areas of divergence: RECIRC is working&nbsp;with metadata categories rather than xml tags;&nbsp;although each instance of reception evidence is&nbsp;supplied as full-text, these instances are themselves&nbsp;extracts from significantly larger texts. Moreover,&nbsp;RECIRC is concerned with all - women’s and men’s -reception of female authors, which allows for equally&nbsp;productive conversations about gender and reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RECIRC data are stored in an online database, which will be made publicly accessible at the project’s&nbsp;close, and is intended to be interoperable with cognate&nbsp;projects, such as the NEWW Women Writers Virtual&nbsp;Research Environment. The database architecture&nbsp;(built using a RESTful API approach) enables multiple&nbsp;output formats and we will discuss possibilities for&nbsp;interoperable outputs. Moreover, the project is now&nbsp;(October 2016) at the stage of data cleaning, in&nbsp;preparation for experimenting with visualization tools&nbsp;and quantitative analysis. We aim to create network&nbsp;visualizations and analyses that embrace both the&nbsp;gendering of reception and the relationships of texts&nbsp;with each other. Questions include: Which genres of&nbsp;female-authored texts were most popularly&nbsp;circulated? What forms of circulation (translation,&nbsp;excerpts, citation) were most conducive to their&nbsp;transmission? How important (and prevalent) was&nbsp;attribution to their circulation? Which female authors&nbsp;were reading and using other women writers? What&nbsp;circulation contexts promoted women as authors? If&nbsp;accepted to DH2017, we intend to present our&nbsp;preliminary answers to the questions and patterns&nbsp;that emerge during this quantitative analysis phase.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
