<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Emergent programs like those associated with the Praxis Network have redefined the possibilities for&nbsp;digital humanities training by offering models for project-based pedagogy. These efforts provide innovative&nbsp;institutional frameworks for building up and sharing&nbsp;digital skills, but they primarily focus on graduate education. The long-term commitments that they require&nbsp;can make them difficult to adapt for the professional&nbsp;development of other librarians, staff, and faculty collaborators. While members of these groups might&nbsp;share deep interests in undertaking such programs&nbsp;themselves, their institutional commitments often&nbsp;prevent them from committing the time to such professional development, particularly if the outcomes&nbsp;are not immediately legible for their own structures of&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My talk argues that we can make such praxis programs viable for broader communities by expanding the range of their potential outcomes. This talk explores the potential for collaborative writing projects&nbsp;to develop individual skillsets and, by extension, the&nbsp;capacity of digital humanities programs. While the example here focuses on a coursebook written for an undergraduate audience, I believe the model and set of&nbsp;pedagogical issues can be extrapolated to other circumstances. By considering writing projects as potential opportunities for project-based development, I argue that we can produce professionally legible outcomes that both serve institutional priorities and&nbsp;prove useful beyond local contexts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Case Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The particular case study for this talk will be an open </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">coursebook</span><span class="font3"> written for a course on digital text&nbsp;analysis (Walsh and Horowitz, 2016). In the fall of&nbsp;2015, Professor Sarah Horowitz, a colleague in the history department at Washington and Lee University,&nbsp;approached the University Library with an interest in&nbsp;digital text analysis and a desire to incorporate these&nbsp;methods in her upcoming class. As the Mellon Digital&nbsp;Humanities Fellow working in the University Library, I&nbsp;was asked to support Professor Horowitz’s requests&nbsp;because of my own background working with and&nbsp;teaching text analysis. Professor Horowitz and I conceived of writing the coursebook as a means by which&nbsp;the Library could meet her needs while also building&nbsp;the capacity of the University’s digital humanities resources. Our model in this regard was as an initiative&nbsp;undertaken by the Digital Fellows at the CUNY Graduate Center, where their Graduate Fellows produce documentation and shared digital resources for the wider&nbsp;community. We aimed to expand upon their example,&nbsp;however, by making collaborative writing a centerpiece of our pedagogical experiment. Through her involvement in the the creation of the course materials,&nbsp;Professor Horowitz engaged with a variety of technologies: Markdown, Git, and GitHub. The process also required synthesis of both text analysis techniques and&nbsp;disciplinary material relevant to a course in nineteenth-century history. As a result of our initial collaboration in writing the materials and teaching the&nbsp;course, Professor Horowitz is prepared to offer the&nbsp;course herself in the future without the support of the&nbsp;library. In addition, we now possess course materials&nbsp;that could, after careful structuring and selection of&nbsp;platforms, be reusable in other courses at our own institution and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This type of writing collaboration can fit the professional needs of people in a variety of spaces in the university. Course preparation, for example, often takes place behind the scenes and away from the eyes of students and other scholars. With a little effort, the hidden labor of teaching can be transformed into openly&nbsp;available resources capable of being remixed into&nbsp;other contexts. As Shawn Graham (2016) has illustrated through his own resources for a class on Crafting Digital History, course materials can be effectively&nbsp;leveraged to serve a wider good in ways that still parse&nbsp;in a professional context. In our case, the collaboration&nbsp;produced public-facing web writing in the form of an&nbsp;open educational resource. The history department&nbsp;regarded the project as a success for its potential to&nbsp;bring new courses, skills, and students into the major&nbsp;as a result of Professor Horowitz’s training. The University Library valued the collaboration for its production of open access materials, development of faculty&nbsp;skills, and exploration of workflows and platforms for&nbsp;faculty collaboration. We documented and managed&nbsp;the writing process in a </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">GitHub repository</span><span class="font3">. This versioned workflow was key to our conception of the project, as we hoped to structure the project in such a way&nbsp;that others could copy down and spin up their own&nbsp;versions of the course materials for their own needs.&nbsp;We were careful to compartmentalize the lessons according to their focus on theory, application, or course&nbsp;exercises, and we provided </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">documentation</span><span class="font3"> to walk&nbsp;readers through the technical process of adapting the&nbsp;book to reflect their own disciplinary content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Implications for DH Praxis</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My talk argues that writing projects like this one provide spaces for shared learning experiences that&nbsp;position student and teacher as equals. By writing in&nbsp;public and asking students and faculty collaborators to&nbsp;discuss, produce, and revise open educational resources, we can break down distinctions between&nbsp;writer and audience, teacher and student, programmer and non-programmer. In this spirit, work by Robin&nbsp;DeRosa (2016) with the Open Anthology of Earlier&nbsp;American Literature and Cathy Davidson with HASTAC&nbsp;has shown that students can make productive contributions to digital humanities research at the same time&nbsp;that they learn themselves. These contributions offer a&nbsp;more intimate form of pedagogy - a more caring and&nbsp;inviting form of building that can draw newcomers&nbsp;into the field by way of non-hierarchical peer mentoring. It is no secret that academia contains “severe&nbsp;power imbalances” that adversely affect teaching and&nbsp;the lives of instructors, students, and peers (McGill,&nbsp;2016). I see collaborative writing as helping to create&nbsp;shared spaces of exploration that work against such&nbsp;structures of power. They can help to generate what&nbsp;Bethany Nowviskie (2016) has recently advocated as a&nbsp;turn away from the Kantian ideal of an isolated, reasoning self and towards, instead, a “feminist ethics of&nbsp;care” to “illuminate the relationships of small components, one to another, within great systems.” By writing&nbsp;together, teams engage in what Nowviskie (2011) calls&nbsp;the “perpetual peer review” of collaborative work.&nbsp;Through conversations about ethical collaboration&nbsp;and shared credit early in the process, we can privilege&nbsp;the voice of the learner as a valued contributor to a&nbsp;wider community of practitioners even before they&nbsp;might know the technical details of the tools or skills&nbsp;under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Collaborative writing projects can thus serve as training in digital humanities praxis: they can help introduce the skills, tools, and theories associated with&nbsp;the field, and projects like ours do so in public. Productive failure in this space has long been a hallmark of&nbsp;work in the digital humanities, so much so that “Failure” was listed as a keyword in the new anthology </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</span><span class="font3"> (Croxall and Wernick,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2016). Writing in public carries many of the same rewards - and risks. While a certain comfort with frustration can help one learn digital methods (Ramsay, 2016) not everyone is comfortable with what Stephen&nbsp;Ramsay (2014) describes as a “hermeneutics of screwing around.” Many of those new to digital work, in particular, rightfully fear putting their work online before&nbsp;it is published. I argue that the clearest way in which&nbsp;we can invite people into the rewards of public digital&nbsp;work is by sharing the burdens and risks of such work.&nbsp;In her recent work on generous thinking, Kathleen&nbsp;Fitzpatrick (2016) advocates “rooting the humanities&nbsp;in generosity, and in particular in the practices of&nbsp;thinking </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font3"> rather than reflexively </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">against</span><span class="font3"> both the&nbsp;people and the materials with which we work”. By&nbsp;framing digital humanities praxis first and foremost as&nbsp;an activity whose successes and failures are shared, we&nbsp;can lower the stakes for newcomers. Centering this approach to digital humanities pedagogy in the practice&nbsp;of writing productively displaces the very digital tools&nbsp;and methodologies that it is meant to teach. Even if the&nbsp;ultimate goal is to develop a firm grounding in a particular digital topic, focusing on the writing invites students and collaborators into a space where anyone can&nbsp;contribute. By privileging soft rather than technical&nbsp;skills as the means of engagement and ultimate outcome, we can shape a more inviting and generous introduction to digital humanities praxis.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></p>
