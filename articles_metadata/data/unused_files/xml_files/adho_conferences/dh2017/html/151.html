<p><span class="font4">The Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is a research group within the faculty of Humanities of the&nbsp;University of Basel. The research profile of the DHLab&nbsp;integrates computer science, digital imaging,&nbsp;computational photography and the accessibility of&nbsp;digital objects in humanities research. The project&nbsp;“Digital Materiality”, an interdisciplinary project in&nbsp;collaboration with the Seminar of Art History,&nbsp;examines how new digital methods and techniques&nbsp;can be used to describe the reflection of light on&nbsp;surfaces of artworks. Of main interest are mosaics&nbsp;and early prints; both categories have a strong&nbsp;interaction with light and standard photographic&nbsp;approaches are not able to capture the dynamic&nbsp;component of the light-surface interdependence that&nbsp;is specific for this kind of objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For art historians who study and work with mosaics or any other object of complex surface&nbsp;composition, it is difficult to capture and visualize the&nbsp;important surface features in such a way that&nbsp;research can be done with the reproduction. The&nbsp;major problem is the static nature of photographic&nbsp;reproductions, which does not allow interaction.&nbsp;Static, two-dimensional photographs cannot visualize&nbsp;appropriately the sparkling effect caused by the&nbsp;surface properties of the countless light reflecting&nbsp;tesserae of a mosaic, for example. Similar&nbsp;considerations apply for early prints, books and&nbsp;parchments. The visual impression that these objects&nbsp;convey is hardly delivered by a photograph. Metallic&nbsp;inclusions give the artwork a dynamic appearance&nbsp;caused by the change of reflectance behavior of glossy&nbsp;compared to matte material. Furthermore, the scholar&nbsp;may want to integrate information coming from other&nbsp;types of scientific photographs, such as infrared or&nbsp;ultraviolet illuminated or induced fluorescence&nbsp;images, to increase the visual impression of&nbsp;renderings of artwork. In particular, the combination&nbsp;of such scientific photographs with other imaging&nbsp;techniques like Reflectance Transformation Imaging&nbsp;is advantageous because multiple visual impressions&nbsp;can be combined in a way that would not be possible&nbsp;in reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reflection Transformation Imaging</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RTI (Reflectance Transformation Imaging) (Mudge et al, 2007; Malzbender et al, 2001) is a promising&nbsp;approach to go beyond the limitations of conventional&nbsp;photographic methods. However, RTI, as it is used&nbsp;today, has some drawbacks that are critical in the&nbsp;context of the reproduction of mosaics, metallic&nbsp;inclusions or most other artwork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RTI makes it possible to interactively display the light reflection as a function of the light incident angle&nbsp;and the structure of the surface captured. RTI needs a&nbsp;series of digital images from a fixed camera position,&nbsp;in which the light source is illuminating the object in&nbsp;each capture from a different position. In order to&nbsp;produce RTI renderings of objects of different size,&nbsp;several lighting systems have been developed that&nbsp;consist of a number of light sources that are mounted&nbsp;on the inside of a hemispherical dome. Those light&nbsp;sources can be switched on and synchronized&nbsp;sequentially with a digital camera. The fixed design&nbsp;ensures a fixed and equal distance between the&nbsp;numerous light sources and the object. Thus, with&nbsp;such an automated setup the image capture process is&nbsp;drastically accelerated and, in addition, ensures a&nbsp;high reproducibility. In the Digital Humanities Lab&nbsp;such a dome has been developed as well; In this&nbsp;specific case it is an alloy design, which is equipped&nbsp;with 50 LEDs and an electronic control system, which&nbsp;enables the automatic sequential triggering of the&nbsp;light sources and the synchronization with the&nbsp;camera. The image sequence, recorded in this way,&nbsp;serves in a second step as data basis for a subsequent&nbsp;pixel-based modeling. For this purpose, a&nbsp;mathematical model - normally a function of second&nbsp;order - is fitted for each pixel position, which&nbsp;represents the set of all image points from the&nbsp;different directions of illumination, i.e., it is&nbsp;parameterized so that the square mean error of all&nbsp;data points relative to the function curve becomes&nbsp;minimal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reflection model so far used in the original RTI method described by Hewlett Packard (Mudge et al,&nbsp;2006) corresponds to the mentioned simple second-order function. Thus it has only a relatively low&nbsp;mathematical complexity and therefore a limited&nbsp;precision to represent the actual surface reflection.&nbsp;This specific function, however, describes matt&nbsp;surfaces, a Lambertian radiator, very precisely.&nbsp;However, this method is not suitable for glossy&nbsp;materials, since this simple model does not&nbsp;correspond to the physical laws of gloss reflection. A&nbsp;further disadvantage is that the method, as it is&nbsp;usually used today, needs a specially designed viewer&nbsp;application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Digital Humanities Lab, the method has been enhanced in order to be able to present more&nbsp;complex surfaces that are made from different&nbsp;materials. In our approach the complexity of the&nbsp;mathematical model is increased so that we can&nbsp;handle diffuse and gloss surface components at the&nbsp;same RTI image. In other words, this improvement&nbsp;makes it possible to model and display materials with&nbsp;different gloss levels using the same mathematical&nbsp;model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A suite for humanities scholars ‘needs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For humanities research another important aspect is the compatibility to web-based Virtual Research&nbsp;Environments (VRE). In principle, a functional&nbsp;graphical &quot;front-end&quot; with a connection to a database&nbsp;can be called a VRE. The aim of such a digital&nbsp;infrastructure for research is to allow scholars to&nbsp;work with methods and tools in the digital domain as&nbsp;they would do it in a conventional “analogue” process.&nbsp;This should be done in such a form that the scientists&nbsp;can intuitively recognize and use the well-known&nbsp;concepts and working methods that are offered by&nbsp;the VRE. This requires some basic functions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">In any case, a browser-based client-server solution is preferable to a stand-alone&nbsp;application. In such a way collaborative&nbsp;work can be more easily achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">In many humanities disciplines intensive work is being done with image material and&nbsp;objects, in which specific areas (region of&nbsp;interest, RoI) are often to be emphasized.&nbsp;Therefore corresponding graphic elements&nbsp;(lines, polygons) are necessary, with which&nbsp;such areas can be marked. These graphical&nbsp;elements can, for example, be polygonal line&nbsp;sections or rectangles, which allow the&nbsp;marking of object parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">The method of evaluating image material, which is common in the human sciences, is&nbsp;of a more qualitative nature. This kind of&nbsp;work requires extensive and powerful tools&nbsp;to capture descriptive and contextual&nbsp;metadata (annotations, transcriptions,&nbsp;comments). These meta-objects have to be&nbsp;linked with the actual primary object and&nbsp;need also to be stored in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visualization in a VRE must be multi-media. Besides text, image, sound and video, it is also of&nbsp;advantage to be able to display objects in a virtual 3D&nbsp;space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be able to integrate an RTI solutions into a webenvironment to support real-time collaborative work needs specific web-technologies (Palma et al, 2010;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MacDonald and Robson, 2010). The presented RTI viewer is fully web-compatible and it can be&nbsp;integrated in most browsers to support high-quality&nbsp;client-side visualization; the key technology that&nbsp;allows this integration is WebGL. This OpenGL-based&nbsp;programming interface, which has been optimized for&nbsp;&quot;embedded systems&quot;, is nowadays integrated into any&nbsp;modern Web browsers. WebGL is a license-free&nbsp;standard developed to work seamless in conjunction&nbsp;with the programming language JavaScript. For the&nbsp;application in a browser this means that 3D&nbsp;functionalities are provided without the need to load&nbsp;any additional plug-ins. The performance and range&nbsp;of functions of WebGL are impressive. WebGL is also&nbsp;supported on most mobile devices, such as&nbsp;smartphones and tablets, which further increases the&nbsp;range of applications. The improved performance of&nbsp;WebGL, in contrast to many other graphics libraries,&nbsp;also allows for fluid interactive work. Long rendering&nbsp;times are left out and the visual latency is minimal.&nbsp;WebGL offers a variety of functionalities, ranging&nbsp;from simple grid models to complex animated,&nbsp;textured and illuminated surfaces. The fact that the&nbsp;use of graphic elements for marking RoIs is easily&nbsp;possible with this large range of functions is, of&nbsp;course, self-evident.</span></p><img src="151_files/151-1.jpg" style="width:246pt;height:134pt;"/>

<p><span class="font4">The integration of all those technologies and new developments allows us to present an improved&nbsp;solution to reproduce and render surfaces of different&nbsp;materials (matt and glossy) in a fully web-based&nbsp;environment implemented in JavaScript and WebGL,&nbsp;running on standard computers and mobile devices.&nbsp;In addition to RTI image processing, photographs in&nbsp;the UV and IR domain can be captured, displayed and&nbsp;superimposed with the same system to allow the user&nbsp;to compare the same region under different light&nbsp;condition. For flexibility, performance and data&nbsp;permanence aspects our RTI image server will follow</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the International Image Interoperability Framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">IIIF</span><span class="font4">). IIIF defines a standardized URL syntax to serve digital images online in the field of cultural heritage&nbsp;and research. The region of interest, resolution,&nbsp;rotation and the file format of a requested image can&nbsp;be indicated on the URL. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">SIPI,</span><span class="font4"> the Simple Image&nbsp;Presentation Interface, developed by DHLab, provides&nbsp;an IIIF compliant image server which is ideally suited&nbsp;for our scope. Due to the fact, that the front-end is&nbsp;compatible with any standard web-browser, it can be&nbsp;integrated in a virtual research environment using&nbsp;Knora. Knora is a software framework, developed by&nbsp;DHLab, for storing, sharing, and working with&nbsp;primary sources and data in the humanities. Knora&nbsp;builds the fundament for the Swiss National Data&nbsp;Center for Research Data in Humanities that is&nbsp;operated by the DHLab. The source code is publicly&nbsp;available on </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Github</span><span class="font4"> at the address in reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This integrated environment allows researchers to interactively control the viewing and light conditions&nbsp;of e g. a digital mosaic rendering. Regions of interest&nbsp;can be chosen, annotated, saved, and shared with&nbsp;other scholars. The full set of contextual and technical&nbsp;metadata is stored and time stamped to be fully&nbsp;reloadable and citable back to any point of its history&nbsp;of changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The combination of the Enhanced-RTI and the Scientific Image Viewer (SIV) enables us to convey the&nbsp;impressions of these highly dynamic light-surface&nbsp;interactions and the information provided by IR and&nbsp;UV imaging e.g. to researchers who cannot visit the&nbsp;actual artwork in situ. The visual impression can be&nbsp;enriched by meta information that can shared with&nbsp;other scholars. The presented RTI based solution is&nbsp;also helpful to document the current condition of&nbsp;objects more accurately, e.g. before and after a&nbsp;restoration. Sustainability and simplicity of RTI image&nbsp;data is drastically improved by the use of a IIIF server.&nbsp;The presented infrastructure allows the strict&nbsp;separation of image data and meta information. As a&nbsp;result, any RTI image rendering is fully reproducible&nbsp;and therefore perfectly suited for digital archiving,&nbsp;following the requirements of performance,&nbsp;permanence and reliability.</span></p>
