<p><span class="font2">“The Digital Life Project” at UC Berkeley aims to reframe how we define digital humanities by bringing&nbsp;critical analysis to every stage of a highly collaborative&nbsp;and distributed research process. Below, we provide&nbsp;three examples of how this work is evolving at UC&nbsp;Berkeley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To begin, incidents in the #BlackLivesMatter social movement raised our collective awareness and&nbsp;compelled us to rethink the digital humanities&nbsp;landscape on campus. We realized that&nbsp;understandings of race were being shaped by the&nbsp;dissemination of footage, images, and words. In&nbsp;particular, the dissemination of images of racial&nbsp;violence through media has begun to change the&nbsp;nature of questions in scholarship on race. Questions&nbsp;can no longer overlook a focus on the structure of&nbsp;those sources of data. Furthermore, in this rapid shift,&nbsp;social media must be understood as an infrastructure&nbsp;of hybrid online + offline human existence (i.e., the&nbsp;digital life).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We might perceive the dystopia of digital life in the preponderance of disturbing images of brutality and&nbsp;oppression, an archive that many—including victims&nbsp;of that violence—wish to reclaim. Conversely, we&nbsp;might understand the utopia of digital life to entail the&nbsp;affordance for social media users to document and&nbsp;share their experiences, instantaneously share&nbsp;information, and recruit attention, assistance, and aid&nbsp;to individuals and groups in need. In focusing on the&nbsp;broad rubric of “digital life,” moreover, we want to&nbsp;support both dialogue in the broader university&nbsp;community and plans for focused research on a range&nbsp;of issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first example of research within The Digital Life Project is a collaborative endeavor that is embedded in&nbsp;a digital humanities, ethnic studies methods course.&nbsp;Professor Keith Feldman worked closely with both the&nbsp;Ethnic Studies Library and the D-Lab to implement&nbsp;this project that included 65 undergraduate students,&nbsp;two graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow, in&nbsp;addition to library staff. Students worked with&nbsp;digitized field recordings of events at Berkeley from&nbsp;the late 1960s from the Yuen Archive. The structuring&nbsp;and coding of the audio data went back to (a) all of the&nbsp;students for their individual research papers; (b) the&nbsp;Ethnic Studies Library to help seed a Thesaurus for the&nbsp;Yuen archive; and (c) the public in the form of more&nbsp;user-friendly audio files housed on the Internet&nbsp;Archive. The project impacted multiple constituencies&nbsp;in both immediate and long-term ways. By the end of&nbsp;this course, students were able to historicize the&nbsp;emergence and transformation of the humanities as a&nbsp;field of knowledge, use computational methodologies&nbsp;to conduct research on race and ethnicity, practice&nbsp;various ways to read closely, critically, and against the&nbsp;grain, while at the same time being exposed to the&nbsp;affordances and challenges of digital humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next, we embarked on a groundbreaking initiative to track and monitor types of Internet-based hate: The&nbsp;Online Hate Index (OHI). The goal is to create a&nbsp;comparative analysis of the online locations, sources,&nbsp;and relationships, and motivations behind online hate&nbsp;targeting different populations. Because of the&nbsp;marked rise of xenophobia in America today, the first&nbsp;installment focused on anti-Latino immigrant&nbsp;sentiments; subsequent studies will examine different&nbsp;forms of targeted hate. The D-Lab provided guidance&nbsp;on designing and implementing a computational&nbsp;research methodology that employed Machine&nbsp;Learning. The League of United Latin American&nbsp;Citizens (LULAC) provided specific information&nbsp;relating to anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, and antimigrant populations and enabled the project findings&nbsp;to become actionable. In the future, ADL's Center for&nbsp;Extremism and Center for Technology and Society will&nbsp;provide expertise on the online locations and&nbsp;characteristics of hate groups, in-house computing&nbsp;resources, and the techniques used to terrorize&nbsp;groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After one year of the Digital Life Project, we reflect upon the lessons learned in generating a new body of&nbsp;research through a highly distributed infrastructure</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that optimizes (a) the knowledge of graduate students and staff consultants and (b) mentorship within&nbsp;working groups and research teams comprised of&nbsp;undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, faculty,&nbsp;and staff. At the same time, we are keeping our sights&nbsp;on mobilizing activism in order to foment an&nbsp;activist/researcher stance. Our collaboratory research&nbsp;work clearly defines roles and tasks within the&nbsp;research teams and thereby provides much needed&nbsp;apprenticeship opportunities that underrepresented&nbsp;minorities lack.</span></p>
