<p><span class="font3">Replacing “How something is made, with a view to finding out what it is” with “How something is made, with a view to making it again” -the Essence with the Preparation - is linked to&nbsp;an option that's completely antiscientific: in reality, the starting point of the Fantasy [of the&nbsp;critic's writing of a novel] isn't the Novel (in&nbsp;general, as a genre), but one or two novels out&nbsp;of thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">-Roland Barthes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Preparation of the Novel,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Session of December 9, 1978, 13.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Literariness of Topic Modeling</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This short paper reports on the progress of my attempt to construct a reading of topic modeling using state-of-the-art literary criticism. I argue that dominant digital humanities understandings of topic models assume some of the characteristics of literature&nbsp;most essential to twentieth-century criticism - coun-ter-factuality, a mediated form that is ultimately separable from aesthetic characteristics, and an efficient,&nbsp;self-enclosed, total form. More specifically, I show that&nbsp;topic models also tend to be read by digital humanists&nbsp;according to the assumptions, protocols, and caveats&nbsp;we accord to the interpretation of realist fiction. The&nbsp;result is that while often revealing and productive,&nbsp;many digital humanists' uses of topic modeling are indebted to assumptions about the literariness and fic-tionality of topic models that we have yet to fully understand. Drawing on work by Stephen Ramsay, Johanna Drucker, Alan Liu, and others that theorizes&nbsp;continuities between the values of literary criticism&nbsp;and computational processes, I suggest that we temporarily set aside the idea that topic modeling reveals&nbsp;the &quot;contents&quot; of a set of novels (or of any other corpus). Instead, drawing on Roland Barthes' late work on&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Preparation of the Novel</span><span class="font3">, we might rethink topics&nbsp;as preparatory notes written by no one, as an imaginary archive whose contents furnish a productively alienating, too-perfect map of the novel's preparation. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> Barthes moved away from his earlier&nbsp;work's emphasis on totalizing interpretations of literature's meaning to think about models of the text that&nbsp;allow for a more partial and slow view of the process&nbsp;of meaning creation (See Buurma and Hefferman,&nbsp;2014) Topic modeling has the potential for helping us&nbsp;towards a Barthesian reimagination of the novel's&nbsp;reader as the novel's writer, of the search for the fantasy origins of a novel as a method that pulls us away&nbsp;from formal totality and a form-content divide. While&nbsp;this reorientation comes out of literary studies, I also&nbsp;suggest that it might have applications for more instrumental uses of topic modeling outside the realm of&nbsp;the humanities, in which assumptions about topics as&nbsp;equivalent to a document set's “contents” also tend to&nbsp;draw on our conventions for reading realist genres.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Fictionality and the Topic Model</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The past few years have seen the rapid popularization of topic modeling among humanist scholars in general, and among scholars of literature in particular</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(see Blei, 2014; Erlin, 2014; Goldstone and Underwood, 2014; Laudun and Goodwin, 2013; Meeks, 2013; Jockers and Mimno, 2013; Rhody, 2013 and&nbsp;2016; and Tangherlini and Leonard, 2013). The literature on topic modeling abounds in stern and salutary&nbsp;warnings about the limits and dangers of topic modeling for humanistic study. One can read about the dangers of introducing algorithmic black boxes into literary research, the concern that literary scholars are unprepared to fully (or even partially) interpret the topic&nbsp;models and their related data, and the worry that they&nbsp;fail to understand even the interpretive choices made&nbsp;during corpus preparation. Part of the worry derives&nbsp;from a larger assumption that topic modeling &quot;reveals&quot; the &quot;contents&quot; of novels. We assume that literary critics dipping their toes into topic modeling will&nbsp;shed their traditional interpretive caution in the face&nbsp;of the algorithm's authority, and will misunderstand&nbsp;the un-semantic nature of topics or accept meaningless correlations as meaningful. I want to suggest that&nbsp;all such warnings are relevant only given a very limited understanding of what a topic model is, its imagined relation to the corpus from which it derives, and&nbsp;the goals of the model's interpreter. These warnings&nbsp;do usefully help us think about some of the seemingly&nbsp;inconsequential interpretive choices we make when&nbsp;we choose chunk and clean documents, apply stoplists,&nbsp;select a number of topics to train, and, most importantly, assign semantic labels to unsemantically&nbsp;generated topics. And yet these warnings assume either that topic models aspire to be mimetic maps of the&nbsp;corpuses they model or that technologically unsophisticated interpreters of topic models imagine that this&nbsp;is the case. Schmidt (2013) warns, for example, that&nbsp;&quot;simplifying topic models for humanists who will not&nbsp;(and should not) study the underlying algorithms creates an enormous potential for groundless — or even</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">misleading — “insights.”&quot; He worries that a pair of assumptions about topic models - that they are &quot;coherent&quot; and &quot;stable&quot; - &quot;let humanists assume that the cooccurrence patterns described by topics are meaningful; topics are useful because they describe things that resemble “concepts,” “discourses,” or “fields.”&quot; He is&nbsp;worried, that is, that the appearance of semantic&nbsp;meaning we find in &quot;good&quot; topics will seduce humanists into thinking that they have discovered the &quot;contents&quot; of novels - whereas what topic modeling really&nbsp;offers us is exactly a non-semantic machine indexing&nbsp;of a set of texts about which our approaches tend to be&nbsp;based on ground assumptions about semantic meaning. This is not surprising; the assumption that topic&nbsp;models are a realist genre is pervasive in literature on&nbsp;topic modeling, literary and otherwise (for example,&nbsp;Airoldi et al, 2015, describe good topics with the example of “trout fish fly fishing water angler stream rod&nbsp;flies salmon...” explaining that the topic “is specific.&nbsp;There is a clear focus on words related to the sport of&nbsp;trout fishing. It is coherent. All of the words are likely&nbsp;to appear near one another in a document. Some&nbsp;words-water, fly- are ambiguous and may occur in&nbsp;other contexts, but they are appropriate for this context. It is concrete). Yet if we relieve ourselves of this&nbsp;constraint and instead substitute a more plausible&nbsp;frame - the topic model's fictionality - we will be able&nbsp;to enjoy a wider range of relations between model and&nbsp;corpus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In place of assuming that topic models belong to the realm of realism, then, we might pay more attention to&nbsp;the generative uncertainty of topic modeling and to its&nbsp;literal fictionality. Topics are probabilistically-created&nbsp;formations, and the algorithm that generates topic&nbsp;models is based on the enabling--but crucially, coun-terfactual--&quot;assumption that documents have multiple&nbsp;topics.&quot; (Boyd-Graber et al., 2015). By looking at the&nbsp;documents we offer it, the algorithm generates topics&nbsp;that, in given proportions, compose each document.&nbsp;(Or, rather, it generates the probability that a certain&nbsp;percentage of words in every given document were&nbsp;generated by a given particular topic.) Topics, of&nbsp;course, don't actually exist prior to the documents that&nbsp;generate them; they don't actually exist independently&nbsp;in the same way the documents at all. They are, in a&nbsp;certain sense, fictions. Topics are things that might&nbsp;have existed - but didn't! - given the existence of the&nbsp;document set in question. While we can and sometimes do relegate this fact to the realm of methodology,&nbsp;the fictionality of topics is crucial to remember for any&nbsp;literary-critical uses of topic modeling, for it reminds&nbsp;us that these models offer us a view of our document&nbsp;set radically at odds with any other more literal&nbsp;sources of a novel we might use - such as an author's&nbsp;notes towards a novel, or a catalog of the virtual or actual library of books a novelist brings to the writing table, or even the looser sense of social &quot;discourses&quot; that&nbsp;exist prior to novels and which we might imagine in&nbsp;part &quot;composing&quot; a novel. As Boyd-Graber et alia note,&nbsp;&quot;Topic models are based on a generative model that&nbsp;clearly does not match the way humans write. However topic models are often able to learn meaningful&nbsp;and sensible models.&quot; (2014: 15). Using a few targeted&nbsp;examples drawn from topic models of corpuses of&nbsp;nineteenth-century novels of varying sizes and comparing them to some examples of nineteenth-century&nbsp;novelists' notebooks, I suggest that reimagining topic&nbsp;models as fictional notes might be not just a theoretical exercise but a practical way of conceptualizing the&nbsp;relation between topic model and corpus.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
