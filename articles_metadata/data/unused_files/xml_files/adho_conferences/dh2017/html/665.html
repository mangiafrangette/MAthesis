<p><span class="font0">the outlook for further work in the area and explain how to get involved and how to help ebook readers improve to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prerequisites: no firm prerequisites. Participants with some familiarity with XML, HTML, HTML 5, and&nbsp;CSS will be in a better position to follow the details of&nbsp;examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A short introduction to current standards for electronic books, focusing on EPub 3.0 (a standard issued by the International Digital Publishing Federation)&nbsp;and its supporting specifications: XHTML, HTML 5,&nbsp;CSS, SVG, and Zip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Are the dreams or visions of Ted Nelson, Alan Kay, and other visionaries of electronic books finally coming true? Current tablets, smart phones, and dedicated&nbsp;ebook devices seem to bring them closer to daily reality than ever before. We will survey the current shape&nbsp;of the territory for ebooks: what they can do, what&nbsp;they currently cannot do, what we hope they will be&nbsp;able to do soon. We will demonstrate some of the software available for generating EPubs and for checking&nbsp;them for device- and software-specific problems. Finally, we will outline some outstanding design and&nbsp;production challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of the challenges of ebook production will be familiar to anyone with experience in book or journal&nbsp;production: mathematics, tables, graphics, and figures&nbsp;are no easier to handle (but, happily, not always much&nbsp;harder) in electronic books than they are in print publications or on the Web. Others will be familiar from&nbsp;web-site production: ebook readers and applications&nbsp;vary both in terms of what then can do and in terms of&nbsp;how closely they adhere to the EPub specification. The&nbsp;requirement that ebooks be self-contained and work&nbsp;with no network connection brings new challenges, as&nbsp;does the the need for accessible content. Participants&nbsp;will learn how to check against relevant specifications,&nbsp;how to research problems, and how to attain an intuition for the sorts of things that are both possible and&nbsp;practical today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The International Digital Publishing Federation (IDPF), which developed EPub, has recently merged&nbsp;with the World Wide Web Consortium; we will discuss</span></p>
