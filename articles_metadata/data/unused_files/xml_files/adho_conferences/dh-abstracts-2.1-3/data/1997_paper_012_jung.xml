                    <head>1. Introduction</head>
                    <p>If morphologically analyzed sentences are directly parsed, a number of
                        translation failures caused by the limitations of word-to-word translation
                        may happen. The following show two sentences and their translations for this
                        difficulty.</p>
                    <p><eg>"He gave to his opinion." -> "Geu-neun geu-eui euigyeon-eul balpyo-hayeotda."</eg><lb/>
                        <eg>"I don't think his work is up to much." -> "Na-neun geu-eui jakpoom-i
                        daedan-chiantago saenggak-handa."</eg></p>
                    <p>The underlined phrases cannot be directly translated only by their own
                        meanings. We define compound unit(CU) as a bundle of words that is difficult
                        to be directly translated or appear in the same form regardless of context.
                        These units are necessary to recognized for more natural translation. But,
                        previous work like [Bond95], [Lauer94] and [Li95] has interest only on one
                        or two categories of the following. [SHYoon94] classifies CU into five categories.<list>
                            <item>1. traditional metaphorical idioms: "kick the bucket" ->
                                "jookda"</item>
                            <item>2. typical word usage: "prevent ~ from -ing" -> "~ga -haneun
                                geot-eul banghae-hada"</item>
                            <item>3. compound words: "operating system" -> "oonyeong chaeje"</item>
                            <item>4. lexical gaps: "by name" -> "jimyeong-hayeo"</item>
                            <item>5. frozen expressions: "How are you?" -> "annyeonhaseyo?"</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>We add (6) phrasal verbs: "put on ~" -> "~eul ipda" in these categories.</p>
                    <p>CU reduces the search space of parser by divide-and-conquer strategy and
                        resolves some POS(part-of-speech) ambiguities [HGLee94]. It also brings down
                        the loads of morphological/syntactic generation module by providing
                        pre-defined natural translation. We use several mechanisms for more
                        efficient recognition, for instance, (1) cooccurent constraint POS
                        information, (2) cooccurent constraint string set, (3) verb type information
                        and (4) pseudo syntactic tag. We also use syntactic tag for CU which has
                        unclear bound. It makes for syntactic analyzer to parse with predictable
                        top-down method.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>2. Terminology</head>
                    <p>(1) Conjugation Tags: These tags represent various conjugation forms. VBD,
                        VBG, VBN, VBP and VBZ are conjugation tags in [Marcus93]. If CU has the
                        first constituent with one of the tags, the conjugation tag is used to
                        represent the unit instead of pre-defined representative POS tag, which is
                        in CU dictionary.</p>
                    <p>(2) Verb Type Information: This information consists of two categories,
                        action mode/position information and verb-modifee form information. Action
                        mode/position information consists of seven types that represent the
                        properties of verb, for example, T-type verb is transitive verb with an
                        object. Verb-modifee form information restrains the constituents which are
                        modified by current verb, for instance, 1-type is one or more nouns
                        following verb. We use modified verb type information from [Longman83] and
                        [GCKim92].</p>
                    <p>(3) Variable Constituent and Fixed Constituent: We can find CU "keep ~ in ~
                        mind" from the following sentence, "I kept the words in my mind yesterday".
                        "keep", "in" and "mind" of the unit are fixed forms regardless of context.
                        We define this kinds of words as fixed constituents. "the words" and "my"
                        can be replaced with some other words by the context. These context
                        sensitive words are defined as variable contituents.</p>
                    <p>(4) Pseudo Syntactic Tag: Pseudo syntactic tag is zero or positive integer
                        number for CUs and variable constituents. This tag implies the syntactic
                        meaning that can be mapped to syntactic tag. For example, CU "keep ~ in ~
                        mind" is converted into "keep *1#1 in *1#2 mind" as a dictionary entry. *1
                        is pseudo syntactic tag for representing the unit, "#1" and "#2" for the two
                        variable constituents. All pseudo syntactic tags are attached to the first
                        word of corresponding unit or constituent. These forms make CUs with
                        embedded structure represented with hierarchy. The following example is an
                        embedded structure and its expression.</p>
                    <p>
                        <eg>[sentence]
                            "Investors continued to pour into money funds"
                        [CU]
                        "continue to #1(VB)" -> *1, "pour into #1(NP)" -> *2, "money funds" -> *3
                        
                        [sentence with pseudo syntactic tags]
                        "Investors continued(*1) to pour(*2, *1#1) into money(*3, *2#1) funds"
                        {*n | n = 1, 2, 3, ...} is for CU, {#n | n = 0, 1, 2, ...} is for variable constituent</eg>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>3. System Structure</head>
                    <p>Figure 1 shows the system structure of CU recognizer.</p>
                    <figure/>
                    <p>The search module of CU extracts all possible CUs for each word by
                        referencing index. Index is the memory view of index dictionary that is a
                        binary form of CU dictionary. POS attachment module gives representative POS
                        tag to extracted CU. In the case that representative constituent(the first
                        fixed constituent of CU) of the unit is verb or its conjugation, the module
                        does not work. This alternative processing enables syntactic analyzer to use
                        the original meaning of input context. Recognition result creation module
                        draws translations from recognized units, and makes adequate data structures
                        from the results.</p>

                    <p>CU dictionary consists of (1) CU search information, (2) CU information, (3)
                        representative POS information, (4) action mode/position information and (5)
                        translation information. CU search information has the fields for dictionary
                        sorting and index file making. Since CU is designed for English, a word
                        corresponds with a constituent. The contents of CU information vary with
                        constituent type - fixed constituent or variable constituent. There is no
                        information in case of fixed constituent. On the other hand, variable
                        constituent has CU information. Since translation is designed for Korean, an
                        eojeol(Korean word form) corresponds with a constituent. Figure 2 shows the

                    <p>The principle of CU search is "most-specific-expression-first" [SHYoon94].
                        This means "fixed constituent first, variable constituent next" and "longer
                        expression(CU) first", that is, the longest of successfully found
                        expressions for a word is expected to be the best. It also implies that at
                        most one expression can be extracted from each word in a sentence. Thus, the
                        number of expressions is equal or less than that of words in a sentence.</p>
                    <p>The "most-specific-expression-first" can be defined by "more-specific-than"
                        relation >> as follows.</p>

                            if a >> b iff a1 >> b1
                            else if a1 = b1 then a >> b iff a2a3...an >> b2b3...bn recursively
                            where a = a1a2a3...an and b = b1b2b3...bn</eg>

                    <p>CUs are searched on index. Index is the memory view of index dictionary that
                        is made from CU dictionary. Its structure is modified trie in order to
                        represent heterogeneous types(fixed constituent and variable constituent).
                        Figure 3 shows the index structure on memory.</p>
                    <figure/>
                    <p>Index structure consists of (1) beginning index, (2) constituent index and
                        (3) representative information index. Each element of beginning index is the
                        first two characters from the first fixed constituent. Empirically, the case
                        of using the first two characters instead of one reduces searched nodes
                        about 20~80%. Constituent index is modified trie structure for representing
                        the two kinds of constituents. We use "method" mechanism for the
                        heterogeneous types. Control on a constituent node is moved by this
                        "method". The following are "method" types and their action. <list>
                            <item>1. DO_GO_CHILD: in case of exact matching for fixed constituent,
                                go to child node </item>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>An entry of representative information index corresponds to a CU. The entry
                        has common information for the unit - representative POS information, action

                            sentences. Average word number in a sentence is 15.4 with standard
                            deviation of 3.7. The sentences have average path number of 157.2 with
                            standard deviation of 391.5 by our tagger. This means the tagger makes

                        <p>Most unrecognized CUs are caused by unexpected insertion of adverb or
                            adverbial phrase. For example, "heavily" is inserted into CU "invest in"
                            like "invest heavily in" (adverb insertion), and "at midnight Tuesday"
                            into "drop to" like "drop at midnight Tuesday to" (adverbial phrase
                            insertion). All these cases occur between verb and preposition. They can
                            be removed by checking unexpected insertion for some specific positions
                            during CU search.</p>
                        <p>Misrecognized results are divided into two categories. One is sub-CU that
                            is in other recognized CU like "as #1 as" in "twice as many as". The
                            other is insufficiency of cooccurent constraint or syntactic tag
                            information, for example, "take much to" is recognized "take #1 to". We
                            expect that these two misrecognized problems can be resolved by boundary
                            check and supplementation of information.</p>
                        <p>The number of segmentation means that of split pieces for
                            divide-and-conquer. The experimental results show the number is average
                            4.1, that is, a sentence is normally divided into 4.1 pieces by our
                            system. Divide-and-conquer can be obtained from parsing each piece and
                            merging them.</p>

                            Currently, GO-SIBLINGs are much more than the other methods. This reason
                            is from the structure of constituent index. It is modified trie which

                        promising method for high performance parser in view of parsing time and
                        space. The following are the strong points of the system. <list>

                    <p>We have several future works. First, enlarge type information for other POSs
                        as well as verb. Second, apply more efficient structure and mechanism for CU

                        parser.</p>
