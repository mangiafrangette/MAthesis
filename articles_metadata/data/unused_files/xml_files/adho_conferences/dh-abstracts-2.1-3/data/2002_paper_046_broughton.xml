                <p>The paper describes a collaborative project, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities
                    Research Board, between the School of Library, Archive &amp; Information
                    Studies, University College London and two major digital resource gateways, Arts
                    &amp; Humanities Data Service, and the Humbul Humanities Hub.</p>
                <p>AHDS (<ptr target="http://www.ahds.ac.uk"/>) and Humbul (<ptr
                        target="http://www.humbul.ac.uk"/>) are on-going government funded projects
                    for the identification, evaluation and organization of quality digital resources
                    in the humanities, primarily for the use of the higher education community.
                    AHDS' remit includes visual and performing arts and archaeology in addition to
                    traditional humanities disciplines; Humbul covers a slightly narrower humanities
                    field including history, archaeology, literature, theology and philosophy.</p>
                <p>The two are developing a single humanities portal (<ptr
                        target="http://www.portal.ac.uk"/>) which will become operational in 2002.
                    The new portal will draw in resources from the wider Web in addition to the
                    managed material already available.</p>
                <p>An important consideration is the choice of a tool to manage the subject content
                    of the new site. A digital library on the AHDS model has much in common with the
                    conventional library in terms of structuring the semantic content of the
                    resource; it may benefit from the knowledge organization theory that has been
                    developed over the last fifty years within the library sector for the creation
                    of tools for vocabulary management and semantic organization of document
                    content. Systems such as faceted classifications, structured subject headings,
                    thesauri, and other controlled vocabularies provide a scientifically based
                    approach to the analysis of 'document' content, and to the creation of indexes,
                    descriptors, visible taxonomies and hierarchies, as well as linear ordering
                    schemes (i.e. rules for filing order and sequencing) for the physical management
                    of materials with respect to intellectual content. These have been tested over
                    managed bibliographic databases as well as print-based materials, and the theory
                    is at a high level of sophistication.</p>
                <p>Existing means of subject organization at AHDS and Humbul are the Library of
                    Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC),
                    both designed for organization of print-based material in a traditional library.
                    While these offer management advantages (e.g. an established system with
                    institutional support, regular maintenance and revision, and centralised
                    bibliographic services) they are not particularly useful within a digital
                    environment. They display little sophistication in the structure, cannot handle
                    complex objects well, and can do little to expose the complex interrelationships
                    and multidimensional links within the structure of the digital collection.</p>
                <p>The new humanities portal requires a system that performs several functions;<list

                <p>The School of Library, Archive &amp; Information Studies (SLAIS) at
                    University College London has a particularly strong history in education and
                    research in classification and indexing. It is one of only a few British schools
                    offering teaching in this area, and its staff are actively involved in the
                    management of several systems of bibliographic classification, and research into
                    the development and use of faceted schemes. We are investigating a structure of
                    this kind for the organization of the new humanities portal.</p>
                <p>Classifications built on the facet analytical model provide effective tools for
                    analysing and organizing documents on the basis of their subject content, and
                    consequently for retrieving those documents from a managed store. They work on
                    different principles from older enumerative schemes such as Dewey and the
                    Library of Congress classifications which simply provide long lists, or
                    enumerations, of classes for the accommodation of documents.</p>
                <p>Facet analysis was conceived by S. R. Ranganathan, a mathematician by training,
                    and a student at SLAIS in the 1920s. He proposed a system for the description
                    and organization of documents with complex subject content, based on
                    identification and analysis of constituent parts of the subject, rather than by
                    creation of lists or enumerations of compound classes into which specific
                    documents must be fitted. Documents were analysed, the content encoded, and the
                    codes synthesised into an appropriate classmark which was used for filing and
                    which was expressive of the subject content.</p>
                <p>Ranganathan's system was ground-breaking, but relatively unsophisticated. It
                    continues to be developed in India, but is virtually unused outside that
                    country. In the UK the Classification Research Group, formed in the 1950s,
                    further developed facet analytical theory.</p>
                <p>The internal logic of a faceted system of the CRG type is based on rigorous
                    analysis of the terminology of a subject, whereby terms are sorted into standard
                    sets of functional categories. Within these categories a range of semantic
                    relations are acknowledged, and problems of vocabulary control (such as
                    synonymy, partial synonymy and variations in word forms) are addressed. A
                    sophisticated system syntax provides for arrangement and combination of terms
                    both intra- and inter-category, and for the management of syntactic relations.
                    This improves performance in the accommodation of complex subjects, the
                    predictability of location, and in the effectiveness of retrieval.</p>
                <p>A faceted classification is, in its simplest form, a structured set of simple
                    terms or concepts with rules for the combination of these into compound concepts
                    such as occur in the content of documents. These compounds are placed precisely
                    in the base structure by the application of the system syntax. When these
                    classes are populated by the 'real' subjects of documents (or other objects with
                    semantic content) a more complex structure grows in accordance with the internal
                    logic of the system.</p>
                <p>A faceted classification, when applied to a large collection of documents, can
                    generate a very complex knowledge structure of n-dimensionality and great
                    logical regularity, with deep levels of hierarchy. The resultant structure can
                    be utilised in a number of ways; as an ordering device, as a source of index
                    terms and subject headings, and can also be converted to a thesaurus. Hypertext
                    can be utilised to expand the levels of hierarchy, or to make links between
                    distributed elements.</p>
                <p>An example of a small classification for religion demonstrates how the structure
                    can be applied:<lb/>

                <p>The regularity of the system and its rules of syntax suggests that much of the
                    routine work of managing documents could be carried out automatically, once the
                    initial intellectual analysis has been made.</p>
                <p>In a testbed implementation for the research, AHDS and Humbul are applying the
                    knowledge structure to the Portal's planned metadata repository for all the
                    digital objects in their collection; it is likely that XML will prove to be the
                    best tool for the implementation of the structure. They will also experiment
                    with its use in cross-disciplinary browsing and retrieval of digital resources
                    which are held elsewhere.</p>
