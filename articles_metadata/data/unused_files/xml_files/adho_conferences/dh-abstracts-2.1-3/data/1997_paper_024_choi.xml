                    <p>Multilingual machine translation means translation between more than two
                        languages. The existing multilingual machine translation systems can be
                        classified into the transfer-based and interlingual-based multilingual
                        machine translation. In the former the analysis and generation rules were
                        written each other differently, so that the commonness of the languages was
                        ignored and the whole memory space led to increase. The latter had the
                        difficulty in implementing the linguistic universal model available to many
                        languages. In order to get over the shortcomings of these existing
                        multilingual machine translation systems, this paper describes the
                        multilingual MT systems through the common rules which can accept the
                        commonness of languages and many languages can share.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>1 Introduction</head>
                    <p>The analysis and generation rules in the existing transfer-based multilingual
                        machine translation systems (SYSTRAN, EUROTRA, METAL, LOGOS, GETA etc.) are
                        independent and different according to target languages.[Hutchins 1992] It
                        says that the existing multilingual machine translation systems don't
                        acknowledge the commonness of languages. For this reason the existing
                        multilingual machine translation systems have the form like the bundle of
                        bilingual MT systems and this leads to a result increasing the size of
                        system. There are the transfer-based multilingual machine translation
                        systems that use interlingual method for reducing the transfer processes
                        (CETA, SALAT, DLT, KANT etc.), however they have difficult problems to
                        complete the linguistic universal model[Lewis 1992]. From this point of view
                        this paper describes the new multilingual machine translation method by the
                        common rules and constraint rules to overcome the problem the existing
                        multilingual machine translation systems have. The common rules mean the
                        rules that are in common with more than two languages. It is the merits of
                        common rules that can reduce the memory space, augment the consistency of
                        grammatical information and standardize the information structure of lexicon
                        because the common rules are loaded into memory only once. They also have
                        another merit for MT. That is, new grammar modules can be created easily
                        through the combination of 'common' rules when we add a new language to the
                        existing system and translate it into the existing languages. The constraint
                        rules mean the rules controlling the linguistic characteristics of
                        individual languages. This paper consists of three parts: In the chapter 2
                        the construction of the whole system is introduced. The chapter 3 describes
                        the modules consisting of common rules, that is, the common grammatical
                        rules, the common lexicon information structure, the common structural
                        transfer rules, and the common information transfer rules. In the chapter 4
                        we explain the analysis and transfer of Korean through the parameterized
                        common rules and the constraint rules.</p>

                    <p>The Figure 1 shows the system construction of multilingual machine
                        translation by the common rules and constraint rules:</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The middle field of Figure 1 means the common module. 'rn' is a file of
                        common rules consisting of the common module. These files of the common
                        rules are called by the grammar modules of the individual languages and
                        constitute the grammar rules of an individual language together with the
                        constraint rules for the language. For example, Korean, Japanese, English
                        and German in Figure 1 have in common a rule file r3, but Korean and
                        Japanese share more rule files r2 and r4 because they are more similar in
                        the language typology than English and German</p>

                    <head>3 Common rules</head>
                    <p>In this chapter I will show the construction of common rules. Common rules
                        for analysis consist of the common grammar rules and the common lexicon
                        information structure and those for transfer consist of the common
                        structural transfer rules and the common information transfer rules.</p>
                    <div>
                        <head>3.1 Common grammatical rules</head>
                        <p>To handle many languages in multilingual machine translation system,
                            common grammatical rules should explain linguistic phenomena of as many
                            countries as possible. For explanation of linguistic phenomena of
                            configurational language (e.g. English) as well as nonconfigurational
                            languages (e.g. Korean, Japanese, German) whose word order is relatively
                            free, we have made new grammar rules where X-bar syntactic
                            theory[Jackendoff 1977] and HPSG [Pollard 1994] were mixed. The new
                            grammar was made in binary structure except the coordination structure
                            which was made in triple structure.</p>

                        <head>3.2 Common lexicon information structure</head>
                        <p>We need to make the lexicon information structure in order to input,
                            manage and correct consistently the lexicon information of the
                            multilingual machine translation system. It is desirable to build not
                            monotonic, but multiple structure so that the information structure of
                            lexicon may represent the possible linguistic information and be moved
                            collectively. From this point of view I have selected the feature
                            structure as the multilingual lexicon information structure and made the
                            attributes be the same in many languages. Appendix 2 shows an example of
                            multilingual lexicon information structure.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <head>3.3 Common structural transfer rules</head>
                        <p>There is also the part in the transfer process the many languages can
                            share. It is the compositional transfer that copies the node of the
                            source language to that of the target language if the analysis structure
                            of the former and the generation structure of the latter are the same.
                            We make use of the method deleting the functional words and then
                            transforming the syntactic nodes to the 'predicate-argument-modifier'
                            nodes in our multilingual machine translation system in order to
                            transfer compositionally the different structures between the languages.
                            We have recorded the noncompositional structural rules unusable to the
                            common structural transfer rules in the transfer lexicon because they
                            depend on the lexemes. The transfer rules have the priority order: the
                            noncompositional structural transfer rules are applied first to the
                            transfer process, second, the common structural transfer rules and last,
                            the lexical transfer rules in the lexicon. The following rule shows the
                            common structural transfer rule:<lb/>
                            <eg>(1) common_structural_transfer_rule = {}.[+node] &lt;=&gt;
                                {}.[+node].</eg></p>
                        <p>The rule (1) says that all compositional transfer trees, that is, '+node'
                            are transferred unvaryingly from the source language to the target

                        <p>Simplifying the transfer process in the multilingual machine translation
                            is also able to result from the separation of the structure from the
                            information. In the existing transfer-based machine translation systems
                            the structural transfer has included the information transfer. It has
                            brought out the duplication of the information and the increase of the
                            memory space. But the isolation between the structure and the
                            information results in excluding the shortcomings of the existing
                            machine translation systems. In this sense, the common information
                            transfer rules have the function to transfer the common information
                            available to many languages, that is, they are the rules that copy the
                            semantic informations from the source language to target language. The
                            semantic informations are produced by the mapping from form to its
                            meaning in the analysis. The following rules show the common information
                            transfer rules: (We use the notation of the CAT2 system.)</p>

                        <p>The lexical semantic transfer says that the lexical semantic information
                            of the source language is copied to that of the target language on the
                            same node level and the reverse too ('&lt;=&gt;' means the
                            bidirection). The transfer of semantic roles shows the copy of the
                            information of the semantic role between the source language and the
                            target language.</p>

                    <head>4 Korean analysis and transfer by constraint rules</head>
                    <p>The grammar of individual languages consists of the universal rule and its
                        parameter [Chomsky 1981]. The language typology can be classified by the
                        parameter [Greenberg 1963]. There is an example of machine translation[Dorr
                        1993] that has used the univeral principle and its parameter. According to
                        the Greenberg's parameterized word order we can consider the Korean standard
                        word order as follows:</p>
                    <p>(3) Standard Word Order of Korean</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>This standard word order gives an individual language a clue for its
                        parameter. In the next section we will see the paramterized common
                        grammatical rules for Korean.</p>

                        <p>According to the Korean standard word order the head word must always
                            follow its argument or modifier. From this point of view we can select
                            the head-final common rules for Korean under the multilingual common
                            grammatical rules in the Figure 1. The head-final rules in Figure 1 and
                            Head Feature Principle percolating the information of lexical head into
                            that of its phrase are as follows: (the coordination structure of Korean
                            can be considered as part of the 'Argument-Functional word structure'. I
                            hold the coordination structure of Korean as the triple structure for
                            the efficient analysis.)</p>

                        <p>The syntactic tree of Korean results in the semantic tree through tree
                            transformation. The semantic tree has the 'predicate-argument-modifier'

                            transducing the Korean syntactic tree (5) to the following semantic tree
                            through the transformation rules.</p>

                        <p>The semantic tree becomes the input of transfer. All semantic trees that
                            can be transferred compositionally are transferred to target language by
                            the 'common structural transfer rules' and 'common information tranfer
                            rules'. There is, however, the compositional transfer that is not able
                            to apply to the common information transfer rules. The idiomatic
                            expressions with functional verbs 'hata(do/make)' or 'toyta(be done/be
                            made)' belong to this example. We delete 'hata' during transformation
                            from syntactic tree to semantic tree and copy the information of 'hata'
                            to the feature 'functional verb' of predicate noun, so that the
                            predicate of a sentence becomes the predicate noun during transformation
                            from syntactic tree to semantic tree and copy the information of 'hata'
                            to the feature 'functional verb' of predicate noun, so that the
                            predicate of a sentence becomes the predicate noun. But there is no
                            multilingual rule that can control the relation between the predicate
                            noun of source language and the predicate noun of target language or
                            between predicate noun of source language and verb or adjective of
                            target language. For this reason we need the rule constraining the
                            common transfer rule. Now we have the transfer constraint rules for the
                            common information transfer rules.</p>

                    <head>5 Conclusion</head>
                    <p>In this paper I have proposed a new philosophy of multilingual machine
                        translation that accepts the commonness of languages to reduce the memory
                        space of the multilingual machine translation system and to simplify the
                        transfer process. This philosophy is explained by the common rules for many
                        languages and the constraint rules for the individual languages. For
                        example, the analysis of Korean is explained by the parameterized common
                        rules and the constraint rules and the transfer from Korean to other target
                        languages is explained by the common structure transfer rules, the common
                        information transfer rules, and the transfer constraint rules. The following
                        table shows the size of the common and constraint rules used for the
                        analysis and transfer of Korean in the translation from 300 Korean sentences
                        to English or German.</p>

                    <p>Although the multilingual machine translation by the common rules and the
                        constraint rules is performed reasonably well, reducing the analysis rules
                        and simplifying the transfer process, there are yet many problems to be

The CAT2 system is now working on a UNIX-workstation. Its programming language is PROLOG and it uses the 'constraint bottom-up chart' parser. We are now translating Korean into English as well as German and are testing the translation from Korean into French, Chinese, Russian, and Japanese as the target languages.</emph></p></div>
