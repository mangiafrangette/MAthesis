                <p>This paper discusses the goals, architecture, and usability of Kirrkirr, a
                    Java-based visualization tool for XML dictionaries, currently being used with a
                    dictionary for Warlpiri, an Australian Aboriginal language.</p>
                <p>While dictionaries on computers are now common, there has been surprisingly
                    little work on innovative ways of utilising the capabilities of computers for
                    visualization, hypertext linking and multimedia in order to provide a richer
                    experience of dictionary content. Most electronic dictionaries present the
                    search-dominated interface of classic information retrieval (IR) systems, which
                    are only effective when the user has a clearly specified information need and a
                    good understanding of the content being searched. The ability to browse often
                    makes paper dictionaries easier and more pleasant to use than such electronic
                    dictionaries. Search interfaces are ineffective for information needs such as
                    exploring a concept. Some work in IR has emphasised the need for new methods of
                    information access and visualization for browsing document collections (Pirolli
                    et al. 1996), and we wish to extend such ideas into the domain of dictionaries,
                    in part because indications are that current interfaces are unlikely to have
                    much direct educational benefit for students (Kegl 1995).</p>
                <p>Our goal has been to provide a fun dictionary tool that is effective for browsing
                    and incidental language learning. In particular we attempt to address Sharpe's
                    (1995) "distinction between information gained and knowledge sought". The speed
                    of information retrieval that e-dictionaries deliver, and the focused
                    decontextualized search results they provide, can frequently lead to loss of the
                    memory retention benefits and chances for random learning that manually
                    searching through paper dictionaries provides.</p>
                <p>Within the Australian context, indigenous dictionary structure and usability are
                    often dictated by professional linguists, while the needs of others (speakers,
                    semi-speakers, young users, second language learners) are not met. Another major
                    goal has been to design an interface usable by, and interesting to, young users
                    and other language learners. From this viewpoint, the low level of literacy in
                    the region, and the inherently captivating nature of computers suggests that an
                    e-dictionary is potentially more useful than a paper edition. Among other
                    benefits, we can provide an interface less dependent on good knowledge of
                    spelling and alphabetical order.</p>
                <p>Our dictionary interface initially targeted Warlpiri, a language of Central
                    Australia, for which there has been an extensive on-going project for the
                    compilation of semantically-rich lexical materials (Laughren and Nash 1983, Hale
                    and Laughren [to appear]). We converted this data from a non-standard format
                    into a richly-structured XML version (XML 1999). The current version uses ad hoc
                    indexing of this textual version for efficient access, but we expect to move to
                    XQL, as this standard matures. Our system is written in Java, using the Swing
                    API, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix).</p>
                <p>For dictionaries with plain textual content behind them, there is little that
                    they can provide in the way of output but an on-line reflection of a printed
                    page. In contrast, XML allows definition of the precise semantics of the
                    dictionary content, while leaving unspecified its form of presentation to the
                    user. We exploit this flexibility in our application, by having the program
                    mediate between the lexical data and the user. The interface can select from and
                    choose how to present information, in ways customised to a user's preferences
                    and abilities.</p>
                <p>One dimension is that as well as the definitions of words, users frequently want
                    to know their relationships to other words, and the patterning in these
                    relationships. Kirrkirr provides a color-coded network display of semantic links
                    between words, which can be explored, manipulated and customised interactively
                    by the user (Jansz et al. 1999) using the animated graph-drawing techniques of
                    (Eades et al. 1998, Huang et al. 1998). In their spring algorithm, a network of
                    words become nodes which are held apart by gravitational repulsion, but kept
                    from becoming too far apart by springs which have a natural length. This graph
                    algorithm differs from most others by providing iterative updating of the graph
                    layout, which means that users can drag nodes across the screen, and the
                    algorithm will cause other nodes to flee out of the way, while words related to
                    another word are dragged along. The detailed semantic markup of the dictionary,
                    with many kinds of semantic links (such as synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and
                    other forms of relationships) allows us to provide a rich browsing experience.
                    For example, the ability to display different link types graphically as
                    different colors solves one of the recurring problems of the present web, with
                    its one type of link: users have some idea of what type of relationship there is
                    to another word before clicking. Thinking of the lexicon as a semantic network
                    with various kinds of links was a leading idea of the WordNet project (Miller et
                    al. 1993), but the simple text based computer interface they provide fails to do
                    justice to the richness of the underlying data. Others have attempted to remedy
                    this lack (e.g., Plumbdesign 1998), but we feel that our work is better aimed at
                    providing the kind of simple network display suitable for our users.</p>
                <p>To augment traditional semantic relations in the dictionary, we provide also
                    linkages derived automatically from collocational analysis (of the limited
                    amount of online Warlpiri text), and present an interface derived from semantic
                    domains. These interfaces both address the notion of "terminology sets" - words
                    that belong together, a notion which seems particularly salient for native
                    speakers (Goddard and Thieberger 1997). We discuss the determination of
                    collocational bonds, using the method of Dunning (1993), and the limitations of
                    what we can do with the data available.</p>
                <p>Formatted dictionary entries, displayed using HTML, are produced from the
                    underlying XML by the use of XSL stylesheets (XSL 1999). These provide
                    conventional hypertext for navigating between entries, in particular providing a
                    color-coding of different kinds of semantic relationships between words which is
                    consistent with that in the network display. A variety of XSL stylesheets are
                    provided, which can give different formatting to the dictionary content
                    appropriate to different users. For instance, items such as abbreviations for
                    parts of speech, and other grammatical notes, and detailed decompositional
                    definitions can be confusing for most Aboriginal users (Corris et al. 1999), and
                    style sheets can provide just the desired information in large easy-to-read
                    type.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above, the dictionary incorporates multimedia - the user can
                    hear words and see appropriate pictures - and a conventional search interface.
                    The dictionary provides a user-friendly console where search results can be
                    sorted and manipulated. As well as standard keyword search, which can optionally
                    be restricted to appearance within a specified XML entity, the system provides
                    two features targeted towards two principal groups of users. Linguists often
                    want to search for particular sound patterns (such as certain types of consonant
                    clusters), and so the system allows regular expression matching for such expert
                    users. On the other hand, the limited literacy level of many potential users
                    means that they will have particular problems looking up words. In part this is
                    due to particular problems whereby the phonetic orthography of Warlpiri does not
                    match very closely to the (rather arcane) spelling rules of English in which
                    their literacy skills are usually based. To alleviate this problem, we have
                    implemented a "fuzzy spelling" algorithm which attempts to find the intended
                    word by using rules which capture common mistakes, sound confusions and
                    alternative spellings.</p>
                <p>We have performed some preliminary trialling of the dictionary through visits by
                    Mim Corris to Yuendumu and Willowra, and Jane Simpson to Lajamanu. This has
                    involved completing dictionary tasks, and observational use with primary and
                    lower secondary students and trainee Warlpiri literacy workers, and comments
                    from teachers and other adults. In general reactions have been quite
                    enthusiastic, and the dictionary does appear to succeed in creating and
                    maintaining interest. We have received suggestions on how to make it a better
                    basis for classroom activities, which we hope to incorporate in future versions.</p>
                <p>The diversity of areas researched in this work is rare relative to past work in
                    electronic dictionaries, which often addresses the problems of storage,
                    processing and visualisation/teaching as unrelated. Despite some significant
                    research into the construction of lexical databases that go beyond the confined
                    dimensions of their paper ancestors, there has been little attempt at seeing
                    this work through to benefiting people such as language learners, who could
                    truly gain from a better interface to dictionary information. Additionally, the
                    range of potential users here is considerably more diverse than encountered in
                    typical studies of dictionary usability (e.g., Atkins and Varantola 1997). For
                    instance, issues such as low levels of literacy are rarely touched on. Our
                    system has attempted to reduce the importance of knowing the written form of the
                    word before the application can be used, while having ample opportunities to
                    learn written forms. Features such as an animated, clearly laid out network of
                    words and their relationships, multimedia and hypertext aim at making the system
                    interesting and enjoyable to use. At the same time, features such as advanced
                    search capabilities and note-taking make the system practical as a reference
                    tool. Having designed the system to be highly customisable by the user, it is
                    also highly extensible, allowing new modules to be incorporated with relative
                    ease. We thus think that it is a good foundation for an electronic dictionary,
                    and while the focus of this research has been on Warlpiri, this research (and
                    the software constructed) can be easily applied to other languages.</p>
