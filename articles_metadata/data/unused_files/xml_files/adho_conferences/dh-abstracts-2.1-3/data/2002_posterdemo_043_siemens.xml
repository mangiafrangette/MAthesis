                <p>What lies at the intersection of computational methods and humanities scholarship
                    -- humanities computing -- is of growing importance, an importance that is seen
                    both in the rise of contributions made by such approaches to field specific
                    research and research dissemination, and in its representation in the
                    undergraduate and graduate curriculum of a growing number of institutions. Even
                    so, there is no single resource available to introduce this field's concerns and
                    to serve its curricular needs. Our <emph rend="italics">Companion to Humanities
                        Computing</emph> is, thus, proposed as much out of pragmatic necessity, to
                    address the unmet needs of a growing area of inquiry, as it is out of curricular
                    service, to serve those needs by offering a selection of specially commissioned
                    articles representative of the central concerns shared by all those interested
                    in humanities computing.</p>
                <p>Aimed specifically at serving students and instructors in upper level
                    undergraduate courses, those at the graduate level, and interested leaders both
                    within and outside academe, the Companion will provide a representation of the
                    field and its curricular concerns that documents the field's evolution, its
                    current state, and its potential future.</p>
