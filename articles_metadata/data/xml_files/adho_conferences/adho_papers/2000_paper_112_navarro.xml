                    <p>In this paper we present a hypermedia design and production methodology
                        integrating markup languages and object-oriented techniques. This
                        methodology tries to solve the main problems presented during hypermedia
                        development, improving the communication between customers (content
                        providers and interaction designers), and developers (software designers and
                        programmers).</p>

                    <head>1. Introduction</head>
                    <p>Hypermedia production is a complex and costly task with a specific need to
                        involve experts of very different fields during all the phases of the
                        software development. Usually in traditional software production, the
                        customer gives the functional and operational requisites to developers, who
                        in a very independent way implement the program. On the contrary, in
                        hypermedia production we need more implication of the customer providing all
                        the information needed to build the application. We have learned all these
                        lessons during the construction of Galatea, an educational hypermedia for
                        French text comprehension, developed in collaboration with a linguists team
                        (complementary information about Galatea can be found in [Fernandez-Manjon
                        et al. 98]).</p>
                    <p>This customer presence, providing contents and interaction, originates a
                        severe problem in the design phase. In this phase we need a systematic and
                        well-defined formalism to represent the application in an abstract way that
                        facilitates the relationship between customers and software designers.</p>
                    <p>Two main approaches have been used to solve this problem. One solution is the
                        use of hypermedia models in the design and development of these
                        applications. The other one is to use object-oriented diagrams to cover the
                        design phase. In this paper we analyze both approaches [Navarro 98], and
                        propose a production hypermedia methodology integrating hypermedia models
                        and object-oriented techniques. Our methodology
                        [Navarro&amp;Fernandez-Manjon 00, Navarro&amp;Sierra 00] tries to solve some
                        of the problems identified in previous approaches facilitating the
                        interaction between customers and developers, easing the code generation
                        based on design phase, and improving the application maintenance.</p>

                        techniques</head>
                    <p>Hypermedia models as <emph rend="italics">Dexter Hypermedia Model</emph>

                            >Trellis Model</emph> [Stotts and Furuta 89], and <emph rend="italics"
                            >Hypertext Design Model HDM</emph> [Garzotto et al. 93] present
                        important advantages [Garzotto et al. 93], and a few drawbacks. They are
                        closed systems, making it impossible (or very difficult) to include complex
                        computational activities in the hypermedia application, if the model doesn't
                        support this activity; some of them are too hard to be managed by non
                        computer science people; and none of them enables the design of an
                        hypermedia application centred on the information structure, with a real
                        independence of the presentation structure.</p>
                    <p>Object-oriented software development methodologies, as Booch [Booch 94] or
                        UML [Rumbaugh et al. 98], are extensively and successfully applied in
                        computer projects development, because they improve software quality and
                        maintenance, but these methodologies also present some drawbacks. They are
                        not primarily intended for the development of hypermedia applications; and
                        they use diagrams which are valuable for software designers, but very
                        difficult to be understood by a customer team.</p>
                    <p>Our approach combines ideas for both domains, and integrates them through the
                        use of XML. XML, the <emph rend="italics">Extensible Markup Language</emph>
                        [W3C XML], is the evolution of the first attempt to represent markup
                        languages in a standardized way, SGML, the <emph rend="italics">Standard
                            Generalized Markup Language</emph> [ISO/IEC SGML]. XML is based on
                        descriptive markup (the tag semantic is not specified in the tag
                        definition); the separation between the structure, content and treatment of
                        a document; and the platform independence. To achieve these goals XML
                        defines the set of tags that conform to the markup language (that is the
                        document structure) through an XML construction called <emph rend="italics"
                            >DTD</emph> (Document Type Definition). This DTD is the grammar that
                        formally describes the structure of a class of text, and a document that
                        includes the DTD tags to structure its content is called an <emph
                            rend="italics">instance</emph> of the DTD.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>3. Our approach</head>
                    <p>As previously stated, our methodology tries to solve the problems identified
                        in previous approaches, improving the communication between customers and
                        developers. In our approach, developers are divided into software designers
                        that must provide a representation of the application (code independent),
                        and programmers that translate this representation into real code. Customers
                        also play a double role. They are the content providers that organize the
                        knowledge included in the application (this knowledge has a double
                        structure: natural and hyperlink structure), and they are the interaction
                        designers who decide the time and space of content presentation.</p>
                    <p>Interaction between the content providers team and the software designers
                        team is one of the problems that our methodology solves. We use an XML DTD,
                        called the content DTD, to represent the contents of the application, and
                        the hyperlinks between these contents. The content provider team describes
                        the structure of the contents (using natural language), and the software
                        designers team use this information to build the <emph rend="italics"
                            >content DTD</emph>. Then, the content provider team generates an
                        instance of this content DTD that organizes the contents of hypermedia
                        application in a formal way. The use of meaningful tags, and the inclusion
                        of attributes (properties) in these tags, solves the problem of content
                        providers and software designers interaction. </p>
                    <p>Our methodology also eases the communication problems between the interaction
                        designers team and software designer team. We use another XML DTD, called
                        the <emph rend="italics">presentation DTD</emph> to characterize the
                        presentational structure of hypermedia applications. The elements of the
                        presentation DTD describe the application presentational elements (screens,
                        windows, buttons, etc.) and the hyperlinks between them. This DTD is common
                        to all (or most) hypermedias, and is provided by the software designers
                        team. Moreover we are working in the assignment of a concrete semantic to
                        the presentation DTD, based on an object-oriented windows class hierarchy,
                        to provide a consistent connection between the markup view, and the
                        object-oriented view of our methodology.</p>
                    <p>This separation from content and presentation provides the means to associate
                        different presentations with the same content. The relationship between
                        content DTD and presentation DTD is accomplished through the <emph
                            rend="italics">overmarkup</emph>. Overmarkup basic idea is a very simple
                        one: when we build the instance of the presentation DTD, to describe the
                        presentation and interaction framework of the application, the elements of
                        the content DTD are the content of the elements of the presentation DTD. </p>
                    <p>We apply this overmarkup in two phases. In phase 1, <emph rend="italics"
                            >structural overmarkup</emph>, there are no real contents, and when the
                        interaction designers (helped by software designers) build the <emph
                            rend="italics">instance 1</emph> of the presentation DTD, the elements
                        of the presentation DTD overmark the elements (only the name of the element)
                        of the content DTD, enabling a better understanding of the structure of the
                        application.</p>
                    <p>In phase 2, <emph rend="italics">content overmarkup</emph>, when the
                        interaction designers (helped by software designers) build the <emph
                            rend="italics">instance 2</emph> of the presentation DTD, the elements
                        of the presentation DTD overmark the instances of the elements of the
                        content DTD (the real content) to represent the final hypermedia
                        application. If we need to represent some complex computational activity in
                        the application (for example an exercise that evaluates the learner
                        knowledge) we use object-oriented diagrams (mainly class and state
                        transition diagrams) that are attached to instance 2 of the presentation
                        DTD. This instance 2 is what we call the <emph rend="italics">application
                            design document</emph>, and provides a real representation of the total
                        application used by customers and programmers. Customers (content providers
                        and interaction designers) use the design document to evaluate if it
                        conforms to its requirements, and make any change (obviously they ignore the
                        object-oriented diagrams). Programmers use part of this document in the
                        coding phase directly, whereas other parts represent the application design
                        that they must translate in real code. This task is facilitated by the
                        relation between presentation DTD and real object-oriented code, and

                    <head>4. Conclusions and future work</head>
                    <p>We think that our approach provides a solution for the development of
                        hypermedia applications, solving the problems of hypermedia models and
                        object-oriented construction techniques. Indeed our solution is not closed
                        (we have integrated all the power provided by object-oriented development
                        techniques), and is specifically created to deal with hypermedia software.
                        Our experience in the Galatea development has showed us that XML markup (and
                        its supporting tools) is easy enough to be used by customers (a similar
                        approach is used in [Nanard and Nanard 95]), and the design phase is totally
                        covered by overmarkup.</p>
                    <p>Content and presentation DTD improve the communication between customers and
                        developers, and provide the means to capture the content and presentation
                        structure in different stages. Overmarkup phases integrate these structures:
                        structural overmarkup represents a fast application "prototype", and the
                        design document is a complete application representation that solves the
                        interaction problem between customers and software designers. Moreover we
                        can use the structure provided by the presentation DTD to generate part of
                        the object-oriented code (improving the communication between software
                        designers and programmers), and the existence of the design document
                        facilitates the application maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Present work includes the total assignment of an object-oriented semantic to
                        elements of presentation-DTD. The next step is the development of a CASE
                        tool that facilitates the overmarkup process, and that provides different
                        views of the application (overmarkup view, window view - an application
                        preview - and object-oriented view).</p>
