                <p>The impact of SGML and XML on computing in the humanities is wellknown. Markup
                    languages have been used on such diverse texts as Nordic runes (Driscoll <note
                        n="1">Driscoll, M. J., <title level="m">Encoding Old Norse-Icelandic primary
                            sources using TEI-conformant SGML/XML: A handbook</title> (<ptr
                            target="http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/handbook/"/>)</note>), to the <title

                        n="2"> UW Centre for the New OED and Text Research (ptr
                        target="http://db.uwaterloo.ca/OED/" />)</note>. Substantial experience has
                    been gained in the application of markup languages to diverse texts with
                    corresponding gains in the usefulness of such texts for computing humanists.</p>
                <p>The default use of SGML for the representation of only one hierarchy, and the
                    explicit prohibition of overlapping elements in XML, has posed considerable
                    limitations to humanists attempting to record their observations of multiple
                    overlapping hierarchies in textual materials. Several approaches have addressed
                    these limitations, ranging from milestone elements(TEI), stand-off markup to
                    record hierarchies (Thomspon 1997<note n="3">Thompson, H.S., and McKelvie, D,
                            <title level="a">Hyperlink semantics for standoff markup of read-only
                            documents</title>, Language Technology Group, HCRC, University of
                            Edinburgh(<ptr target="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~ht/sgmleu97.html"
                        />)</note>), fragmentation of a base text (TEI), to the development of
                    non-SGML/XML markup languages which will require special processing software
                    TexMECS: New meta-language for recording multiple hierarchies (Sperberg-McQueen
                    and Huitfeldt 2001<note n="4">Huitfeldt, C., and Sperberg-McQueen, C.M., <title
                            level="a">TexMECS: An experimental markup meta-language for complex
                            documents</title> (<ptr

                    />)</note>).All of these approaches suffer from a variety of limitations and
                    problems. The most notable problem is a lack of commonly available software to
                    create and make the overlapping hierarchies available to scholarly
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>Durusau and O'Donnell (2001<note n="5">Durusau, P., and O'Donnell, M.B., <title
                            level="a">Implementing Concurrent Markup in XML</title>, Extreme Markup
                        2001. Paper submitted to <title level="j">Markup Languages: Theory and

                    method for recording overlapping hierarchies using XML standards, particularly
                    XPath and XSLT. The essential insight is that the key piece of information in
                    encoding a complex text is membership of a particular piece of text (PCDATA in
                    SGML/XML terminology) in a given hierarchy, and not its surface representation
                    through markup. Whether this membership information is represented in a
                    conventional SGML/XML "tree" or by some other means, it is the information that
                    is of interest to the computing humanist. This technique relies upon the use of
                    XPath syntax to record the hierarchy information for atoms of text in a larger
                    work. For example:<lb/>
                    <code>&lt;w id="w1" sn:clauses="/clauses/clause[1][@id='c1']/s[1]/w[1]"
                        tx:text="/text/para[1][@id='p1']/w[1]"
                        pg:pages="/pages/page[1][@id='p1']/line[1][@id='l1']/w[1]"
                        &gt;This&lt;/w&gt;</code></p>
                <p>Durusau and O'Donnell demonstrated the use XSLT to construct and then query
                    overlapping hierarchies of XML markup on a base text.The theory and practice of
                    querying of XML documents has been under rapid development at the World Wide Web
                    Consortium (XQuery<note n="6">See <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query"
                        /></note>). Despite that pace of development, there has been no systematic
                    investigation of querying texts across multiple hierarchies. However, most of
                    the techniques currently under development recognize the importance of XPath
                    syntax on the effective formulation of an XML query language.</p>
                <p>To develop effective querying of XML documents across multiple hierarchies,
                    Durusau and O'Donnell are developing techniques to visually present overlapping
                    hierarchies to allow "discovery" of fruitful lines of investigation for
                    particular texts. XSLT andSVG are used for this purpose. Overlapping hierarchies
                    may well exist for a text that are of no interest to one researcher that are the
                    focus of research for another. The ability to effectively choose which
                    hierarchies are of interest will be crucial to effective use of overlapping
                    hierarchies recorded for a particular text.</p>
                <p>In addition to allowing a separation of hierarchies of interest from those that
                    are not, the visual presentation of overlapping hierarchies is also the first
                    step towards addressing the need for intimate knowledge of the underlying markup
                    to formulate a query for the multiple hierarchies recorded using this technique.
                    Effective queries now require mastery of the various hierarchies and a working
                    knowledge of their relationships, one to the other, in order to obtain any
                    predictable results. With an entirely visual presentation of the overlapping
                    hierarchies, scholars will be able to choose the hierarchies by display and not
                    markup syntax, as being the subject(s) of further analysis. This paper
                    demonstrates the use of XSLT and SVG to produce visual representations of
                    documents with overlapping hierarchies and the linking of these visualizations
                    to XPath and XQuery statements. Multiple editions, annotations and analyses of
                    Book 1 of Milton's <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> form the test case for
                    these techniques. The more detailed the analysis the greater the need for
                    detailed knowledge of the syntax but that will be only after the scholar has
                    found information of interest and not a general exercise in mastering several
                    divergent markup regimes. This will be of particular importance with many texts
                    such as biblical texts that have complex syntax, grammatical, literary and
                    transmission hierarchies that overlap and combine in complex ways.</p>
