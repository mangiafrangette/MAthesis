            <div>
                <p>Some 25 years ago, Hélène Cixous provocatively anticipated a distinctly female
                    practice of writing. She declared that <emph rend="italics">écriture
                        féminine</emph> would be marked by characteristics which challenge the logic
                    of writing within the “phallocentric” tradition, by its focus on the female
                    body, glorying in a femininity too long repressed, and breaking up received
                    truth through laughter. Her argument, based on her view of the poetic, implies a
                    form of “false consciousness” in that not all women would, or even could,
                    produce texts from this alternative practice. Further, she declared that <emph
                        rend="italics">écriture féminine</emph> cannot be defined or identified
                    outside of itself: <cit rend="block">
                        <quote>It is impossible to <emph rend="italics">define</emph> a feminine
                            practice of writing, and this is an impossibility that will remain, for
                            this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, encoded, coded —which
                            doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. But it will always surpass the
                            discourse that regulates the phallocentric system: it does and will take
                            place in areas other than those subordinated to
                            philosophical-theoretical domination. It will be conceived of only by
                            subjects who are breakers of automatisms, by peripheral figures that no
                            authority can ever subjugate.</quote>

                <p>A generation of French and America feminist critics have addressed Cixous’
                    declaration, pro and con, which is based on two questionable propositions: that
                        <emph rend="italics">écriture féminine</emph> cannot be defined outside of
                    its own terms and that not all women writing may be said to participate in this
                    unique practice.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunate that so important a declaration would be auto-marginalized by
                    positing its own epistemological and social indefinability. While Cixous may be
                    right, that a practice of women’s writing would be hard to identify, she carries
                    her attack of “phallocentric systems” of knowledge—rationality and logic—to such
                    an extreme that any attempt to demonstrate the possibility of the existence of,
                    or isolate some of the characteristics of, an <emph rend="italics">écriture
                        féminine</emph> is invalidated. I would argue, however, that any putative
                    feminine practice of writing should be identifiable as recessive traits in the
                    literary production of women who predate Cixous’s declaration and that these
                    traits may be detected using systematic methodologies.</p>
                <p>A considerable body of recent work on gender marking in language use shows
                    important, even critical, differences in male and female use of language.<note
                        n="2">See for example, Deborah Tannen, <title level="m">You just don't
                            understand: Women and men in conversation</title> (Ballantine, 1990) and
                            <title level="m">Gender and discourse</title> (Oxford, 1994).</note>
                    While much of this work has been restricted to less formal forms of
                    communication—speech, e-mail, and student essays—there is some evidence that
                    gender is an important discriminant in more formal literary texts. For example,
                    Minna Palander-Collin finds in her study of 17th century private letters that
                    there are marked differences between female and male writing, suggesting that
                    the women's letters are more interactional, personal and “involved” than letters
                    by men, which are common features of women’s communication in Present-Day
                        English.<note n="3">Minna Palander-Collin, "Male and female styles in 17th

                    studies by Moshe Koppel, Shlomo Argamon and Anat Shimoni have detected a wide
                    variety of simple lexical and syntactic feature differences in literary texts by
                    men and women in the British National Corpus (BNC). Using machine learning
                    techniques, they are able to infer the gender of an author of an unseen document
                    with approximately 80% accuracy, with moderately better performance for works of
                    fiction than nonfiction.<note n="4">Moshe Koppel, Shlomo Argamon, Jonathan Fine

                <p>In the early 1990s, I attempted to examine the question of <emph rend="italics"
                        >écriture féminine</emph> using the ARTFL database, only to be confronted by
                    the very significant gender bias of the TLF database as it was then constituted,
                    concluding that the sample of texts by women (3.8% of the titles) was too
                    limited to allow for useful comparisons. This limitation led directly to our
                    ongoing effort to digitize a large collection of French literary texts by women,

                    bias of the corpus which was used to compile the TLF dictionary. The gender bias
                    in the data used to compile a massive and “definitive” dictionary is itself an
                    important example of one mechanism of how patriarchal language is propagated and
                        authorized.<note n="6">"Gender representation and <emph rend="italics"

                    are long-term continuities, such as the collocation of <emph rend="italics"

                <p>The continued expansion and improvement of electronic text holdings, in terms of
                    the quality of the data as well as coverage of wider ranges of literatures well
                    outside of established national canons, allows us to revisit theoretical and
                    substantive problematics that we could not address previously. Women's writing
