<p><span class="font2">In the opening years of the twentieth century, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), an organization of businessmen vehemently opposed to labor unions, spearheaded a multifrontal and multi-industry campaign aiming to stop the rapid growth of labor unions. The NAM itself envisioned publicity and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">propaganda - or a &quot;campaign of education,&quot; as the NAM liked to call it - as a key aspect of this campaign.&nbsp;Newspapers, in turn, were to play a crucial role in the&nbsp;campaign. As the head of the publicity agency the NAM&nbsp;hired said, the &quot;infantry&quot; of the whole campaign consisted of &quot;the constant repetition of small paragraphs&nbsp;or short articles throughout the newspapers of the&nbsp;country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The publicity bureau promised that getting this “infantry” into the field was going to be smooth sailing, claiming that &quot;it is easily possible to bring together the&nbsp;vast majority of papers all over the country in a kind of&nbsp;syndicate form.&quot; With this, the bureau referred to syndication of the type now familiar to us, but also something specific to the early 20th century: boilerplate&nbsp;and readyprint. Because typesetting was still very expensive, large numbers of small country newspapers&nbsp;got part of their paper either preprinted (readyprint)&nbsp;or as boilerplate (stories that were already typeset and&nbsp;could be directly printed).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Archival sources show that the NAM, besides hiring a publicity bureau to badmouth labor unions, also created &quot;newsworthy&quot; events that it hoped to get into the&nbsp;press without direct payment: these included, for example, staged anti-union parades and Astroturf antiunion worker organizations. What we do not know&nbsp;with much certainty, however, is to what extent these&nbsp;efforts were successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This poster reports on a preliminary investigation into the extent to which stories reproducing the language or viewpoint of anti-labor organized employers&nbsp;- a language that is quite recognizable if one is familiar&nbsp;with it - were reprinted in early-twentieth-century&nbsp;American newspapers. It draws on the Chronicling&nbsp;America database of newspapers and makes use of a&nbsp;reprint detection algorithm developed for the Viral&nbsp;Texts project. Eventually the aim is to create as comprehensive an account of such reprinted texts as allowed by the geographical and other limitations of the&nbsp;Chronicling America collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sources and methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The dataset used in this investigation consists of the articles (or rather, pages) published between 1897&nbsp;through 1908 that matched the query (worker OR&nbsp;workers OR workmen OR workman) AND (union) in&nbsp;the Chronicling America collection. The time period&nbsp;selected reflects the years surrounding the launching&nbsp;and high point of the employer open shop campaign,&nbsp;including the NAM's hiring of the publicity bureau&nbsp;noted above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The identification of reprints is performed using the passim tool developed by David Smith for the Viral&nbsp;Texts project with the default settings (which were developed on Chronicling America material). The results&nbsp;are formatted into an HTML form for easier manual&nbsp;checking; as the algorithm inevitably identifies irrelevant reprints, the most laborious stage is the culling of&nbsp;the set of identified repeated passages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The early-twentieth-century employer anti-union campaign had a recognizable vocabulary and set of&nbsp;themes, and it is the author's expertise, acquired developed through research on these employer campaigns, that is the main “method” for recognizing stories potentially put out by employers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As of current writing, I have processed 1906, 1907, and, partly, 1908. For these years I have run the passim algorithm and manually examined the resulting&nbsp;identified reprinted clusters, which has turned out to&nbsp;be even more laborious than anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the whole, I expected to see more stories clearly planted by NAM or its allies in readyprint or boilerplate. There are a number of candidates, but these are&nbsp;both less conclusive and have fewer reprints than I anticipated. There are, however, a few very widely reprinted clearly paid-for advertisements excoriating&nbsp;unions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some ways, the partly “negative” results in themselves are rather interesting (they seem not to be at</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">least entirely due to any failings of the algorithm -widely printed items like speeches by the President are also prominent among the reprints). They seem to&nbsp;indicate that despite publicity bureaus' interest in&nbsp;claiming that material could be easily and discreetly&nbsp;planted, the task of shaping public opinion was more&nbsp;challenging that the NAM perhaps anticipated. The&nbsp;very fact that readyprint and boilerplate had to be palatable to a broad cross-section of papers, in an environment where there still were many labor or proworker papers, meant that “syndicated” material&nbsp;needed to be bland and apolitical to sell. Perhaps the&nbsp;democratic role of the press was better protected than&nbsp;expected?</span></p>
