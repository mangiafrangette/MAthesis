<p><span class="font4">In her DH 2014 keynote address, Bethany Nowvis-kie encouraged digital humanists to “attend to the environmental and human costs of DH” (2015). These costs are sometimes accrued through acts of inaccessibility, such as through building websites that are not&nbsp;practical for screen readers or mobile devices. But&nbsp;they may also be accrued through acts of accessibility&nbsp;like exposing communities to unwanted surveillance&nbsp;through digital publications. (See, for example, the recent controversy around the digitization and open access publication of the lesbian erotic magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">On Our</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Backs</span><span class="font4"> raised by Tara Robertson in “</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Digitization: Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should</span><span class="font4">”, as well as&nbsp;Reveal Digital’s </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">response</span><span class="font4">. Projects like </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Mukurtu</span><span class="font4"> are&nbsp;seeking to temper the open access movement by&nbsp;providing a platform that keeps the power of distribution and access within the hands of community members). These costs are accrued whether the intentions&nbsp;are deliberate or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the environmental humanities, like in the digital humanities, &quot;access&quot; is not always a desirable goal. The&nbsp;actions of thousands of First Nations and Native American people, who continue to protest corporate and&nbsp;state access to tribal lands for the purpose of building&nbsp;pipelines, attest that access is both a human and environmental issue. In late October 2016, a viral Facebook campaign launched in the U.S. in response to unsubstantiated reports that the FBI was targeting&nbsp;Standing Rock, North Dakota protesters' locations via&nbsp;Facebook. Regardless of the veracity of the reports, the&nbsp;mass responses on social media—where individuals&nbsp;“checked in” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font4"> to Standing Rock—attest to a&nbsp;perceived privacy violation where personal data is accessed to enact environmental injustices. Access, especially human access, may well put endangered ecosystems at risk, expediting the &quot;climate of extinction&quot; in&nbsp;which, Nowviskie asserts, digital humanists work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The papers in this session confront this “climate of extinction” both directly and obliquely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Drawn from a diverse range of disciplinary fields and locales—including literature, media studies &amp; archaeology, information science, and environmental&nbsp;science—this session interweaves examinations of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the&nbsp;lived ecologies of the digital</span><span class="font4"> with analyses of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">digital&nbsp;representations of lived ecologies</span><span class="font4">. Collectively, they address both the material and immaterial repercussions&nbsp;of digital humanities within the Anthropocene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the contact between humans, non-humans, and the more-than-human, this session asks us to consider&nbsp;the ways in which digital humanists and digital humanities projects are complicit in environmental degradation. How are digital tools leveraged to enact environmental injustices and destruction? How are they&nbsp;used to redress environmental injustice? How might&nbsp;we, in the words of The Dark Mountain Project manifesto “face this reality honestly and learn how to live&nbsp;with it” (“</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">The Manifesto,</span><span class="font4">” n.p)?</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Un)natural Disasters: The United States' Racialized Response to Disaster Relief</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Christina Boyles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Hurricane Matthew wreaked incalculable damage in the United States and Caribbean. According to the&nbsp;Weather Channel, &quot;The eyewall may deliver the&nbsp;strongest, most destructive winds anyone in parts of&nbsp;the northeast and east-central Florida coast has seen&nbsp;in their lifetime. The last, and only, Category 4 hurricane to make landfall anywhere in northeast Florida or&nbsp;the Georgia coast was an 1898 hurricane south of St.&nbsp;Simons Island, Georgia&quot; (&quot;Hurricane Matthew a Potentially Catastrophic Category 4 or 5 Strike Ahead on&nbsp;Florida's East Coast; Strongest in Decades&quot;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In fact, the severe impacts from this hurricane have led to some locations being uninhabitable for weeks or&nbsp;months. Governor Rick Scott encouraged residents of&nbsp;Florida's southeastern shore to evacuate. Other residents, like those farther north in Jacksonville or farther West near Orlando, were put on high alert. Over&nbsp;1.5 million residents of these areas fled their homes&nbsp;(&quot;Hurricane Matthew Strengthens as Florida Governor&nbsp;Urges Evacuations&quot;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not all residents of Florida had the means to escape the onslaught of Matthew. Many residents, particularly&nbsp;those living in rural and inland communities, did not&nbsp;have access to the resources needed to flee the coming&nbsp;storm. In fact, if history has anything to tell us, those&nbsp;without resources will suffer the most. In 1928, Florida was hit by a category 4 hurricane now referred to&nbsp;as the Lake Okeechobee hurricane. Although the loss&nbsp;of life was catastrophic—the Galveston hurricane of&nbsp;1900 is the only natural disaster to have caused more&nbsp;American deaths—the legacy of the storm has largely&nbsp;been lost to history. Nicole Sterghos Brochu asserts&nbsp;that this is &quot;because the vast majority of those who&nbsp;died were black migrant workers, segregated in life&nbsp;and abandoned in death&quot; (&quot;Florida's Forgotten&nbsp;Storm&quot;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fallout of the storm, however, has left a lasting cultural legacy in central Florida. Notably, anger has&nbsp;simmered for decades in West Palm Beach's African-American community over disparate memorials for&nbsp;black and white storm victims. Sixty-nine white victims in a segregated mass grave received personalized&nbsp;burial markers. In a nearby pauper's cemetery, a mass&nbsp;grave of 674 black victims was forgotten and left unmarked, later sharing space with a dump, a sewage&nbsp;plant, and a street extension (&quot;Storm's Path Remains&nbsp;Scarred after 75 Years&quot;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Government documents reveal that the racialized response to the 1928 storm was intentional. Seeking&nbsp;to protect Florida's burgeoning tourist industry, federal officials minimized the damages caused by the&nbsp;storm, even going so far as to dramatically underestimate the death toll. Since many individuals who lost&nbsp;their lives were transient—meaning their names and&nbsp;residences did not appear in census data—the government could easily downplay and even negate their existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To bring the stories of the storm's underrepresented victims back into our cultural memory, I created a Neatline exhibit demonstrating the loss of life the 1928 hurricane caused in both the United States&nbsp;and the Caribbean. To do so, I am also conducting interviews with family members of survivors and embedding their stories into the exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Florida and the Caribbean start to recover from Hurricane Matthew, it is important to note that those&nbsp;living in economically disadvantaged communities&nbsp;will suffer the greatest from the storm's damage. Heavily populated by black residents, these towns risk facing the same mistreatment of these residents both&nbsp;during the storm and in the recovery process, even recent storms—Katrina and Sandy are two prominent&nbsp;examples—reveal that discriminatory practices are&nbsp;common to disaster practices and clean-up processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to prevent a similar injustice it is crucial to point out the United States' racialized responses to&nbsp;natural disasters and to focus aid efforts on the locations most impacted by the storm, many of which will&nbsp;be communities of color. By failing to do so, we risk&nbsp;contributing to a troublesome legacy of disaster relief&nbsp;discrimination.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">No, Drones: Institutional Critique of UAS Data Accessibility and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for</span></h2><h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Environmental Humanities</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nicholas Weber Lindsay Barbieri</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In name, pastiche isn't a method familiar to most earth scientists. But in practice, monitoring and observing environmental phenomena is a recombinatory&nbsp;process not that different from pastiche of the art&nbsp;world; it requires collecting data via a network of remote sensing instruments, normalizing this information so that it can meaningfully interoperate, and&nbsp;combining different stores of data in order to reliably&nbsp;produce knowledge about the natural world. The process of knowledge production in the earth sciences is&nbsp;both techno-scientific (Haraway, 1997), in the sense&nbsp;that sources of data are historically and locally situated, but also highly contingent on evidential cultures&nbsp;(Collins, 1998; Baker, 2011) in that collecting, finding&nbsp;and using data is mediated by the background practices of an academic department, scientific discipline,&nbsp;or research program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Compare our generic description of knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">production in environmental monitoring to Louise</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lawler’s recent series titled ‘No Drones’ - a critique of contemporary art institutions. Lawler created the series through a pastiche process of photographing private art collections, commissioning drawings of her&nbsp;photographs, and then digitizing the illustrations as&nbsp;vector-based images that are magnified and printed on&nbsp;adhesive vinyl (see Image 1 below). For an unassuming viewer, the result is a powerful reflexive image that&nbsp;is both full of layers of symbols and yet stripped down&nbsp;to a single black-and-white outline of complex ideas.&nbsp;For an audience that can unpack the provenance of&nbsp;Lawler's images this work also creates a self-reflexive&nbsp;form of institutional critique of how highly priced and&nbsp;commoditized artworks serve as cultural markers of&nbsp;wealth, privilege, and accessibility (Nixon, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper attempts to use the same form of institutional critique as Lawler (Fraser, 2005) in discussing the emergence of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in&nbsp;environmental monitoring. Our goal is to demonstrate&nbsp;that with reflexivity the process of producing&nbsp;knowledge about environmental phenomena with&nbsp;UAS data can shed considerable light on markers of&nbsp;wealth, privilege and accessibility at play in contemporary informatics-driven science. Further, we argue&nbsp;that by creating ‘legible' provenance information, UAS&nbsp;data can have a dramatic impact on the burgeoning&nbsp;practices of environmental humanities (Castree,&nbsp;2014).</span></p><img src="471_files/471-1.jpg" style="width:247pt;height:124pt;"/>

<p><span class="font4">The use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as tools for collecting innovative remote sensing data and geospatial imaging is increasing. Recent technological advances present communities with an opportunity to&nbsp;use UAS to push boundaries in data collection. The recent drop in costs combined with the advancement in&nbsp;lightweight technology mean UAS could become a&nbsp;ubiquitous means of collecting scientific data (Dunba-bin and Marques, 2012). UAS are predominantly used&nbsp;for imagery, however, given their advantages over traditional data capture methods (higher temporal and&nbsp;spatial resolution, new area access, etc.) novel sensors&nbsp;are being explored and UAS use has opened doors for&nbsp;both researchers and communities interested in monitoring environment, landscapes, community vulnerability and disaster response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We present on three important topics in UAS-based collection of environmental data (1) the results of a&nbsp;survey of UAS use in the earth sciences (flight platforms, data and metadata standards, and data sharing&nbsp;practices) and how this may shape the ability of communities to access these technologies (2) a discussion&nbsp;of the experience of unwanted surveillance and how&nbsp;drones as tools could shift the equity of surveillance&nbsp;(self surveillance / community surveillance) and&nbsp;power dynamics. (3) a discussion of how drone data&nbsp;collection, with unprecedented ability to capture data</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the Lakes</span><span class="font4"> (1835), William Wordsworth famously condemns changes occurring in the Lake District since the late eighteenth century,&nbsp;changes accelerating ironically because visitors were&nbsp;flocking there from all parts of England to see the landscapes Wordsworth celebrated in his nature poetry.&nbsp;Wordsworth is induced to speak out “at length” by a&nbsp;“wish to preserve the native beauty” of the district&nbsp;against the transformations that seem so rapidly to be&nbsp;taking place. The new mobility and accessibility enabled by improved transportation and communication,&nbsp;however, are only part of the problem. The “invention&nbsp;and universal application of machinery” are, for&nbsp;Wordsworth, equally to blame. Rather than simply argue for isolation, Wordsworth's solution to this conundrum of access and preservation is to use the mass&nbsp;print genre of the travel guide as an educational platform for cultivating environmental consciousness toward a reconstitution of the Lakeland as public space:&nbsp;“a sort of national property, in which every man has a&nbsp;right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a&nbsp;heart to enjoy” (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guide</span><span class="font4">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guide</span><span class="font4"> Wordsworth describes the process by which “nature is indebted to the hand of man,” its state and appearance the outcome of historical and&nbsp;social processes. In so doing, he complicates a strain of&nbsp;environmental writing, interestingly often attributed&nbsp;to the Romantic legacy, which differentiates human activity from “the natural,” a habit of thought that, according to ecocritics such as Jason W. Moore (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Capitalism in the Web of Life</span><span class="font4">), ultimately mystifies the role of&nbsp;capitalism in resource exploitation and climate&nbsp;change. Yet perhaps even more provocative is the way&nbsp;Wordsworth analyses the history of travel in the Lake&nbsp;District as essentially a form of colonization and insists, additionally, that the operations of such modernized forces of power on nature demand that readers&nbsp;think ecologically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper will explore how the problem of access Wordsworth identified dovetails with concerns raised&nbsp;by scholars about the environmental and human costs&nbsp;of digital humanities (such as Nowviskie, Parikka, and&nbsp;Haraway, among many others) through the specific example of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lake District Online</span><span class="font4">, a digital research project&nbsp;based on Simon Fraser University's collection of 260&nbsp;illustrated rare books about the English Lake District,&nbsp;including many maps and historical specimens of ornate book bindings, illustrations, and photography,&nbsp;spanning 300 years (1709-2000) with a concentration&nbsp;in the nineteenth century. As Elizabeth DeLoughrey&nbsp;and George B. Handley argue, historicization has been&nbsp;a primary tool of postcolonial studies and it is central&nbsp;to our understanding of land and, by extension, the&nbsp;earth. In order to continue to engage a historical model&nbsp;of ecology and an epistemology of space in time, we&nbsp;must carry these concepts, not least of all the spatial&nbsp;imaginary made possible by the experience of place,&nbsp;into the dialogue around access to emerging digital environments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Guided by this premise, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lake District Online</span><span class="font4"> has produced several freely accessible research, educational, and public engagement resources: 1) an extensible bibliographic research database for linking with&nbsp;other open databases (such as Wikipedia), comprising&nbsp;a metadata framework for searching and indexing bibliographical, biographical, and critical information&nbsp;about the books as well as their contents; 2) an experimental prototype of a teaching and learning platform,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reading Up Close and At a Distance</span><span class="font4">, designed to enable&nbsp;students to interpret literature interactively on different scales; 3) a co-curated public exhibition with the&nbsp;Wordsworth Trust, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wordsworth Country: From the&nbsp;English Lake District to the Pacific Northwest</span><span class="font4">, launched&nbsp;simultaneously at the Wordsworth Museum (UK), SFU&nbsp;Library and Special Collections (BC), and online; and&nbsp;4) a corpus of high-resolution digital images and text&nbsp;files based on the SFU Lake District rare book collection. To approach these resources through the paradigm of colonial violence that Wordsworth identifies&nbsp;at work in the regional landscapes of Cumbria is also&nbsp;to engage empire building and environmental histories as highly mobile, flexible, and mutually constitutive. Moreover, as Wordsworth implies, access - and&nbsp;the related concept of openness - is a question of spa-tiality and especially of boundaries, exclusions, and&nbsp;limitations entailed in the politics and ethics of place&nbsp;making. Focusing especially on the significance of the&nbsp;present location of the Lake District collection in Vancouver, British Columbia, this paper will reflect on colonial legacies of organizing, producing, and accessing&nbsp;nature in the context of the digital humanities.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Decaying Plastic Play: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Flappy Birds</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hacked Afterlife as Media Archaeological Praxis</span></h2><h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jeffrey Moro</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">On March 28th, 2016, prolific YouTube streamer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SethBling posted a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">video</span><span class="font4"> demonstrating how, using only timed button presses and graphical glitches present in the console original, he injected three hundred&nbsp;and thirty-one new bytes into the seminal 1990 Super&nbsp;Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) platforming&nbsp;game Super Mario World—bytes corresponding to the&nbsp;source code of the 2013 viral iPhone game phenomenon Flappy Bird. The hack allows users to play a fully&nbsp;functional port of Flappy Bird within Super Mario&nbsp;World, grafting the former's computational logic into&nbsp;the latter's graphics. The choice of games here is striking; while Super Mario World has been re-released&nbsp;across a variety of hardware platforms—to say nothing of Mario's cultural ubiquity—Flappy Bird remains&nbsp;a touchstone for its inaccessibility, both in its frustratingly difficult design and the fact that in February&nbsp;2014, its creator pulled it from all platforms, citing&nbsp;concerns that its addictiveness ruined people's lives&nbsp;(Nguyen). SethBling's hack then produces a chimeric&nbsp;object; a hybrid of plastic, logic, and time; the ghost of&nbsp;one game haunting the shell of another. This haunting&nbsp;constitutes, as this short paper argues, a regenerative&nbsp;practice: a “circuit bending,” to draw on a theoretical&nbsp;and practical challenge from Garnet Hertz and Jussi&nbsp;Parikka, that engages the “archive” of dead (whether&nbsp;by accident or design) computational media not only&nbsp;within artistic traditions of remix, tinkering, and collage, but also with a media archaeological eye towards&nbsp;circulations of technological waste, supply chains, and&nbsp;resource extractions (“Zombie Media”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In characterizing this haunting as “regenerative,” I engage interdisciplinary work in the environmental&nbsp;humanities and media archaeology alongside tactics&nbsp;from games and software studies. In a post-400ppm&nbsp;world, questions of digital media's emergence from&nbsp;and contribution to the feedback loops of climate crisis&nbsp;within industrial capitalism loom large. In the digital&nbsp;humanities, Bethany Nowviskie's oft-cited keynote at&nbsp;DH2014 in Lausanne provides a cri de coeur, alongside&nbsp;emerging conversations from the GO::DH working&nbsp;group on minimal computing from the same conference, for thinking through the ecological circulations&nbsp;and impacts of DH technologies and practices—what&nbsp;Nowviskie, drawing from Steven Jackson, calls the&nbsp;challenge of “broken world thinking” (5). Media studies as a field has also begun to take up broader questions of climate, geology, infrastructure, and the An-thropocene in theoretical and material studies of digital technologies, whether under the rubric of the “nonhuman turn” (ex. Grusin, Richard, ed. The Nonhuman&nbsp;Turn, U of Minnesota P, 2015); geological and elemental media histories (ex. Parikka, Jussi. A Geology of&nbsp;Media. U of Minnesota P, 2015; Peters, John Durham.&nbsp;The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media. U of Chicago P, 2015); computational infrastructure (ex. Bratton, Benjamin. The Stack: On&nbsp;Software and Sovereignty. MIT P, 2015; Starosielski,&nbsp;Nicole. The Undersea Network. Duke UP, 2015; Blum,&nbsp;Andrew. Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet.&nbsp;Ecco, 2013); or sustainability and waste (ex. Gabrys,&nbsp;Jennifer. Digital Rubbish: A Natural History of Electronics. U of Michigan P, 2011; Acland, Charles, ed. Residual Media. U of Minnesota P, 2007; Scanlan, John. On&nbsp;Garbage. Reaktion Books, 2005). These diverse approaches, only a small fraction of such work, share a&nbsp;common reading of computational technologies both&nbsp;relying on and contributing to a material reorientation&nbsp;of human/Earth relations, whether through open-pit&nbsp;mining, ozone depletion, or undersea cable networking—to say nothing of new social relations made possible by the connective potentiality of such technologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is no coincidence that SethBling's hack emerges at the same time as academic and environmentalist&nbsp;communities' explorations of technological obsolescence, material production, and sustainability/waste&nbsp;grow more prominent. Nor is he working in isolation:&nbsp;his hack is only one within of a subculture of videos&nbsp;exploring different ways to hack, deform, and manipulate “classic” (almost always a euphemism for “obsolete”) video games. Part of these players' engagement&nbsp;with obsolete video games and platforms is practical:&nbsp;the relative (to contemporary platforms) simplicity of&nbsp;the hardware and coding allows for more granular engagement with the technologies themselves. But the&nbsp;choice of Flappy Bird and Super Mario World reveals&nbsp;multiple valences of computational obsolescence and&nbsp;decay: a game forcibly disappeared emerges within&nbsp;one that, through the cooperative/coercive machinations of nostalgia and capitalism, endures. Moreover,&nbsp;the hack itself is a kind of deliberate decay, one that&nbsp;deforms the digital object until it becomes pliable, ma-nipulable, and inscribable. Much like the acrylonitrile&nbsp;butadiene styrene (ABS) that comprises its cartridge&nbsp;shell, the game becomes plastic: transformable, recyclable, and pliable under the right (industrial) conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At its root, this hack plays (in multiple senses of the word) with the roots, tendrils, and growths of computational memory. It reveals “memory” as a function of&nbsp;physical hardware, the encoded rhetoric of software,&nbsp;and the transmission of shared culture. Wendy Hui&nbsp;Kyong Chun, in her 2008 book Programmed Visions,&nbsp;offers the idea of software's “enduring ephemerality,”&nbsp;computational media's capacity to “remember”&nbsp;through material regeneration—continual acts of&nbsp;writing and rewriting across electrical charge and silicon (148). Through this frame, SethBling's hack is rewriting, and its ingenious incarnating and recycling of&nbsp;Flappy Bird's three hundred and thirty-one bytes embodies Chun's claim that “what is not constantly upgraded or ‘migrated' or both becomes unreadable. . . .&nbsp;The experiences of using—the exact paths of execution—are ephemeral. Information is ‘undead': neither&nbsp;alive or dead, neither quite present or absent.” (148).&nbsp;Hertz and Parikka deploy “zombie” as a metaphor for&nbsp;reinvigorated dead media to similar ends, observing&nbsp;that the materials constituting software—the plastic,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the rare earth metals—are also subject to regimes of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ephemerality (150-53). ABS, in its petroleum-based non-biodegradability, may be effectively immortal, but&nbsp;the systems through which humans articulate its use&nbsp;are subject to entropic decay. Only the ephemerality&nbsp;endures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper closes by offering SethBling's hack and the broader gaming subcultures of glitch play to which&nbsp;it belongs as artistic responses to computational obsolescence and decay. Chun's “enduring ephemerality”&nbsp;becomes artistic praxis much as Hertz and Parikka offer circuit bending as a media archaeological arts&nbsp;method. It extends the material concerns of media&nbsp;studies' Anthropocenic turn to code and its cultures,&nbsp;and offers these deforming/reforming modes of play&nbsp;as potential sites of resistance for an ecologically-engaged digital humanities practice.</span></p>
