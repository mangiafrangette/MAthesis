<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Increasingly, art historians, curators, and other arts scholars in an array of institutions—from galleries,&nbsp;libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) to the&nbsp;academy—are turning to digital platforms to facilitate&nbsp;and disseminate new scholarship, promote and&nbsp;provide access to collections, and to engage audiences&nbsp;both within institutional spaces and across&nbsp;geographical networks. Our presentation seeks to use&nbsp;our personal experiences working on digital projects&nbsp;in and related to Digital Art History (DAH) as a mode&nbsp;of analyzing and assessing the current state of the field&nbsp;from the perspective of the paid contract worker. As&nbsp;graduate students with minimal formal training in the&nbsp;Digital Humanities (DH), but with an avid interest in&nbsp;developing our theoretical and methodological&nbsp;knowledge, we feel that our contribution to this&nbsp;emergent and continuously evolving conversation is of&nbsp;value to academic researchers planning and&nbsp;undertaking large-scale digital research projects,&nbsp;particularly those who might be hiring and training&nbsp;research assistants. Because we also seek to&nbsp;contextualize some of the issues we have encountered&nbsp;in the intersections (and interstices) between DAH&nbsp;and DH tools and methods, our study speaks to how&nbsp;these align (or resist aligning) within the conditions of&nbsp;academic institutional realities, where we, as graduate&nbsp;students in Art History, are negotiating the differences&nbsp;between traditional and digital approaches to the&nbsp;discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Project Description</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this paper, we examine how these issues manifest in an on-the-ground institutional context:&nbsp;that of the university research assistantship. We seek&nbsp;to analyze our roles as contract researchers on digital&nbsp;projects, while extending the scope of our examination&nbsp;to include some of the wider-ranging issues that came&nbsp;to light during the course of our work. We then suggest&nbsp;a number of viable solutions and best practices in&nbsp;response to some of the problems we have each&nbsp;encountered, and offer observations about how these&nbsp;issues are systemic within the field of Digital Art&nbsp;History, digital collections, and archives in general—&nbsp;particularly those rich in visual materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While traditional Digital Humanities methods work in some instances (for text or data mining, the creation&nbsp;and dissemination of certain kinds of archival or&nbsp;library-based catalogues, GIS-related geographical&nbsp;applications, and so on), we note that DAH—&nbsp;particularly where it engages with a specifically&nbsp;material- or object-based approach—requires its own&nbsp;specialized methods, most of which are still emergent&nbsp;or have yet to be developed. Borrowing from Johanna&nbsp;Drucker’s writings on the specific needs of art&nbsp;historians working in digital environments, Diane M.&nbsp;Zorich’s studies of extant digital initiatives in cultural&nbsp;institutions in the United States, and bolstered by our&nbsp;own direct experience as graduate students and&nbsp;museum professionals, we perceive that much work&nbsp;needs to be done in the field of DAH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Perhaps even more importantly, we observe that more effort needs to be directed toward making&nbsp;knowledge of effective DAH methods and platforms&nbsp;with DAH-specific affordances accessible within&nbsp;institutional environments that may not have the&nbsp;infrastructure or expertise in place to carry out DH&nbsp;methodologies, and where digital projects are known&nbsp;to have academic capital yet are not effectually&nbsp;supported. It is our hypothesis that these issues, while&nbsp;generally unintentional, are the result of a maladapted&nbsp;atomization of attitudes and methods that were never&nbsp;intended for the disciplinary particularities of projects&nbsp;dealing specifically with visual, aesthetic, and/or&nbsp;material culture; or for the specific needs of broad&nbsp;public-facing institutions such as GLAMs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore despite the gradual emergence of highly visible projects concerning the digital study and&nbsp;dissemination of visual materials—projects such as&nbsp;Object:Photo at the Museum of Modern Art, and the&nbsp;Getty Foundation-funded Online Scholarly Catalogue&nbsp;Initiative—these projects are almost exclusively the&nbsp;purview of large, well-funded institutions. At the same&nbsp;time, we have seen some training opportunities for&nbsp;new digital art historians, such as the 2015 Building a&nbsp;Digital Portfolio institute at George Mason University.&nbsp;As productive as these short-term training institutes&nbsp;are, however, scholars new to DAH require more&nbsp;intensive opportunities to develop these skills,&nbsp;something that many art history departments are&nbsp;currently unprepared to provide. Left out of the&nbsp;equation too are small and mid-sized GLAMs, even&nbsp;those affiliated with large universities, which lack the&nbsp;personnel, experience, and funding to pursue rigorous&nbsp;digital projects. As graduate students and researchers,&nbsp;we have seen first-hand how the absence of a robust&nbsp;network to share ideas and opportunities, teach new&nbsp;skills, and develop new approaches can hamstring the&nbsp;full potential of DAH projects. Although there is a clear&nbsp;interest in and need for platforms and methodologies&nbsp;for Digital Art History, in most instances there is not&nbsp;yet a thriving ecosystem to develop and share them.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although we offer this as a personal, narratological account of our experiences working as research&nbsp;assistants on digital projects (at Brock University,&nbsp;Ontario; and the University of Arizona, respectively),&nbsp;we also analyze how the programming aspects of these&nbsp;projects may be handled in differing institutional&nbsp;contexts—whether researchers are trained in digital&nbsp;applications, out-of-the-box platforms are adopted, or&nbsp;programming and development are outsourced—and&nbsp;examine these practices in light of their compatibility&nbsp;with both the practical and more abstract aspects of&nbsp;our respective endeavors. We will look at how these&nbsp;decisions inform and shape project development&nbsp;trajectories, as well as how they delimit these projects’&nbsp;longer-term potential. Importantly, we will consider&nbsp;issues of accessibility as they concern research&nbsp;assistants, and examine our own limitations in relation&nbsp;to the usability of the tools and platforms at our&nbsp;disposal in our respective institutions. Additionally,&nbsp;we examine how our independent, unpaid projects&nbsp;allow for the extension of boundaries and exploration&nbsp;in the field, and consider the ethical implications of&nbsp;how unpaid work informs and supports our&nbsp;contributions to funded, institution-based projects.</span></p>
