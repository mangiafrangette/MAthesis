<p><span class="font3">This panel centers queer epistemological formations as they structure the study of digital phenomena. Each of the papers mobilizes the methodological foundations of what Kara Keeling has called a “Queer OS” (2014) -- or an operating system in which “the historical, sociocultural, conceptual phenomena that currently shape our realities&nbsp;in deep and profound ways, such as race, gender,&nbsp;class, citizenship, and ability (to name those among&nbsp;the most active in the United States today), [are understood as] mutually constitutive with sexuality&nbsp;and with media and information technologies,&nbsp;thereby making it impossible to think any of them&nbsp;in isolation” (152). The panelists address core&nbsp;questions including how digital infrastructures&nbsp;mirror and/or model queer and feminist approaches to scholarship, social and artistic practice; what are some possible aesthetic/political retoolings for digital technologies originally designed&nbsp;to surveille and/or maximize female bodies as reproductive vessels; how do social media platforms&nbsp;shift the organizing of live performance cultures?;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">what are some of the genealogies for contemporary queer digital culture and design?; how can we mobilize theories of interiors and architecture to help&nbsp;us think about the design of online spaces?; what&nbsp;can we learn from long histories of queer social,&nbsp;erotic, political and artistic life that can help us to&nbsp;build online platforms that resist calls to full public&nbsp;access?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These four papers contribute to the larger conversation at the nexus of Digital Humanities, Digital Media Studies, and Theories and Practices of&nbsp;Transgender, Feminist and Queer Cultural Production. Here we bring together the practice of performance art that merges digital technological invention to the long history of feminist body art, and the&nbsp;often invasive politics of digital surveillance and&nbsp;control of women's bodies, along with the introduction of “Transmedial Drag” as a set of methods&nbsp;for analyzing the digital transfer and potentiality of&nbsp;live performance art, analog queer networks and&nbsp;spaces. We bring this together with a discussion of&nbsp;the development of digital and analog infrastructures for minoritarian spaces and scenes in Mexico&nbsp;City and a material analysis of many of the tropo-logical framings of digital culture--screens, codes&nbsp;and filters--which have been centrally important to&nbsp;the field of feminist design and architectural studies.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transmedial Drag: Transgender, Feminist and Queer Performance Art in the Age of&nbsp;Digital Reproduction</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T.L. Cowan</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">One of the central foci of Digital Humanities scholarship has been the production of online repositories of previously inaccessible archival materials. Often the&nbsp;project of producing an online repository is generated&nbsp;by the assumption that open access to materials that&nbsp;were once held behind the walls of institutional protocols or hidden in personal collections, is a good thing&nbsp;both for the research community that may want access&nbsp;and for the materials themselves and the lives and&nbsp;events that they assemble. However, as scholars invested in the project of decolonization--including&nbsp;Mukurtu and Local Context co-founders Jane Anderson and Kim Christen--have show us, making openly&nbsp;accessible all of the archival materials collected about&nbsp;a particular community, will very likely violate the cultural protocols of that community. Indeed, the entitlement required to imagine that all materials about a&nbsp;particular community should be made accessible to&nbsp;people who are not part of that community is a perspective with long colonial and imperialist genealogies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, I present a range of speculative-pragmatic methods that my collaborators and I have used</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">towards the development of The </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Cabaret Commons</span><span class="font3">: An Online Archive and Anecdotal Encyclopedia for&nbsp;Trans- Feminist and Queer Artists, Activists and Audiences. Over the course of the past 5 years of community-engaged research, we have worked both to assemble materials from live performance scenes in&nbsp;Mexico City, New York City, Montreal and Toronto to&nbsp;make publicly accessible for researchers and artists&nbsp;alike, and to design the Cabaret Commons as an online&nbsp;platform structured by community protocols, filters,&nbsp;ethics, and aesthetics of the stages and performance&nbsp;spaces that structure the social-cultural scenes that&nbsp;produce these materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After years of working with the idea of the Cabaret Commons, I named our method “Transmedial Drag,”&nbsp;and have elaborated how we work in the mode of&nbsp;transmedial drag along with co-investigator Jasmine&nbsp;Rault, and collaborators Dayna McLeod, Carina Guzman and Robyn Overstreet as well as many performance artists with whose work we are in conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Transmedial drag” is the method of study, knowledge production and citational practice involved in moving across media/mediums (for example, from live performance, to video documentation, to&nbsp;digital archive to online platform), which creates a sort&nbsp;of pastiche of the ‘original,' denaturalizing its status as&nbsp;‘originary' and teaching us something new about the&nbsp;excesses and limitations of each media form. Riffing on&nbsp;Judith Butler's game-changing theorization of drag as&nbsp;a performance that, “[i]n imitating gender ...reveals the&nbsp;imitative structure of gender itself--as well as its contingency” (Gender Trouble 138). Or, thinking through&nbsp;Benjamin's anxieties about transmedial transfer in the&nbsp;early 20th Century, it's what we might call </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the work of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">queer performance art in the age of digital reproduction...!</span><span class="font3"> Thus we practice a process-heavy collaborative protocol that seeks to “simulate,” not just the “aura” of&nbsp;live performance, but is also structured by locally-spe-cific, community-based social and political ethics as&nbsp;manifested in minoritized cabaret scenes. Transmedial drag compels us to reckon with the cultural&nbsp;and ethical limitations of digital accessibility in the&nbsp;face of technical possibility (cf. Robertson 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The decolonizing, community-collaboration and accountability methods for the digital transmission of&nbsp;traditional Indigenous knowledges, practiced for example by the projects Mukurtu and Local Contexts,&nbsp;provide a generative model for negotiating this paradox of intimate privacies and networked cultural histories and memories. Indeed, Indigenous studies has&nbsp;pointed out the colonial and Western-expansionist&nbsp;logics and impulses underlying the push to open-access and digitization, and have developed networked&nbsp;information management and archiving systems that&nbsp;follow indigenous cultural protocols, prioritizing privacy and multi-tiered user-generated-access levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What we're calling transmedial drag refers to the troubling excess that remains in even the most ‘successful' transition from one medium or digital form to&nbsp;another - those elements that are incompatible to the&nbsp;form/medium as it currently exists and compel us to&nbsp;ask whether the form/medium exists </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">because of</span><span class="font3"> these&nbsp;constitutive exclusions, or on the condition that certain elements remain excessive/external. Indeed,&nbsp;what remains excessive, incompatible and bit of a drag&nbsp;on the seductive techno-cultural possibilities of openness, are things like labour, consent, privacy, the&nbsp;agency and will of research-collaborators. For those of&nbsp;us trained in gender, sexuality, critical race, post and&nbsp;decolonial research, it becomes clear that our scholarly fields and practices of digital media and digital humanities can be sustained by reproducing a familiar&nbsp;set of constitutive exclusions -- those skills, values,&nbsp;techniques and priorities cultivated by and for the survivance of women, people of colour, indigenous people, trans people, queers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Transmedial drag is indebted to Elizabeth Freeman's work on ‘temporal drag' and Heather Love's on “feeling backward” -- or the ways that queerness is often experienced, expressed or interpreted as an attachment to the past, as a stall in personal or social development, a drag on cultural-temporal progress narratives. We are also indebted to Kadji Amin's work on&nbsp;transgender temporalities, which allow us to understand the ways that “transgender experiences are constituted by yet exceed normative temporalities” and&nbsp;the necessity of incorporating asynchronic temporalities “in order to do justice to the complex ways in&nbsp;which people inhabit gender variance” (220).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With Love, Freeman and Amin, our digital research-creation project is oriented to those people, scenes, cultures, affects and knowledges cast as a drag&nbsp;on the forward-momentum- digital-entitlement fantasies of unfettered access to everything, everyone, everywhere -- fantasies that resonate so strongly with the&nbsp;gender, sexual and racial histories of colonial-moder-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">nity that we know too well. Thus in true queer epistemological form, “transmedial drag” is both a method of study modeled on queer performance and theories of&nbsp;performativity (i.e. Butler) and a conceptual framework through which to make sense of elements of cultural life and work that are generally unintelligible&nbsp;(nonsense).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Like the deep cultural understandings, consultation, collaboration and re-engineering that led to the development of Mukurtu and Local Contexts, we imagine culturally-sensitive and specific software that prioritizes highly nuanced </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">cultural</span><span class="font3"> logics, protocols and&nbsp;specialized knowledges in the development of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">computational</span><span class="font3"> logics, protocols and specialized tools, towards what Kara Keeling calls a “Queer OS/operating&nbsp;system”. Keeling's QUEER OS is an operating system in&nbsp;which the “historical, sociocultural, conceptual phenomena that currently shape our realities in deep and&nbsp;profound ways, such as race, gender, class, citizenship,&nbsp;and ability (to name those among the most active in&nbsp;the United States today), [are understood as] mutually&nbsp;constitutive with sexuality and with media and information technologies, thereby making it impossible to&nbsp;think any of them in isolation” (152).</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3">Indeed, transmedial drag denaturalizes the constitutivweorks for unobstructed open access - and these conti-exclusions of most of our media and information technolnou- ities need to be understood within a context of mod-gies; lets us both recognize their limits and imagine their neecr-n-colonial regimes of gender, sexuality and race.

<p><span class="font3">nority and subcultural scenes seem compelled to reproduce perilous Web 2.0 logics of unbridled open-access -- based in modern-colonial entitlement fantasies of absolute accessibility -- the Cabaret Commons is using trans feminist and queer relational epistemologies&nbsp;towards the decolonizing project of ethical collective&nbsp;platform protocols for sensitive cultural memory, heritage projects and accountable digital design. This is&nbsp;part of a larger epistemological-transformational project to decolonize both trans- feminist and queer practices, and the dominant digital cultural practices that&nbsp;assumes that all networks are networked publics leading us to theorize what we're calling networked privates.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3">What can early twentieth century modernist architecture and design teach us about contemporary decolonizing, feminist, queer and anti-racist practices and protocols for networked digital architecture?&nbsp;Euro-Atlantic modernist architecture was driven by&nbsp;ideals of internationally standardized open communication - beyond the mass rail, steamboat and automobile distribution of low-cost print media and photographic reproductions towards material changes like&nbsp;the open floor plan, strip windows and glass walls, unimpeded visual access to interior and exterior space,&nbsp;eliminating walls and structural as well as decorative&nbsp;or symbolic obstructions to complete open access.&nbsp;There are some striking ideological continuities between these modernist architectural ideals (and aesthetics) and contemporary Euro-Atlantic values of unbridled digitization, designing global information net-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">draw from my research on Eileen Gray - which explores some of the intersections between histories of communication, European architectural modernity&nbsp;and sapphic modernity, or the cultural history of female sexual dissidence - and my collaborative research on “the Cabaret Commons,” designing a networked digital archive for trans feminist and queer&nbsp;performance artists, activists and audiences.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">I focus on the creative extent to which these possibilities depended on codes, screens, filters - as interpretive and communicative strategies, but also as design materials. That is, the aesthetic, social and cultural phenomena&nbsp;of female gender and sexual queerness was enabled at the&nbsp;start of the 20c through complex claims to privacy. My&nbsp;presentation draws connections to my current book project, co-written with T.L. Cowan, provisionally entitled,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Checking In: Feminist Labour in Networked Publics,</span><span class="font3"> which&nbsp;takes up the ways that similar claims to mediated privacy&nbsp;are emerging as central concerns in the design of very different spaces - online digital designs for networked&nbsp;in which this kind of mediation will be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this presentation, I suggest that understanding</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the architectural innovations of Gray and her contemporaries, who built on the premise of mediated privacy, on filtered access, offers us a unique genealogy to studying and designing digital architecture that respond to similar needs and desires for online spaces&nbsp;through which minoritized subjects push back against&nbsp;the dominant pressure for full publicity, for the full&nbsp;availability and open access to our online selves, socialities and intimacies. The metaphor of architecture is</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">often used in reference to online built environments but rarely is the metaphor pushed to a point of usefulness. Danah Boyd has argued that “what it means to be&nbsp;public or private is quickly changing before our eyes&nbsp;and we lack the language, social norms, and structures&nbsp;to handle it” (2007). Indeed, queers, people of color,&nbsp;indigenous people, trans folks, and disabled people are&nbsp;hacking popular social media corporate sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. to build differentiating filters in order to choose which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">selves</span><span class="font3"> to&nbsp;“out” in which contexts, and organizations like the&nbsp;Feminist Technology Network (FemTechNet), the&nbsp;Center for Solutions to Online Violence (CSOV), Fem-Bot, Crash Override (Zoe Quinn &amp; Anita Sarkesian) are&nbsp;working not only to build these infrastructures but&nbsp;also to communicate the differential consequences of&nbsp;total publicity, open access, or the digital ‘open plan.'&nbsp;That is, we can see the development of networked ‘privates' rather than the fetishization of ‘networked pub-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">and on the message my body embodies for their</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">shadowed by the history of that body's significa</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">of that body. For an external audience to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Uterine</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">cervix-as-proscenium - vagina-as-stage, all become</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a singular blank screen of possibilities for viewers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to project their fantasies onto: to imagine its ap</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">pearance and construction, and imagine what</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sounds might emit from my flesh. How might my</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">body distort or otherwise enhance the anticipated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">DJ set? (How) does sound transform the body (my</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">body)? By the time the viewer arrives at my side</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">where they are handed a stethoscope to eavesdrop</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">into/onto/through my flesh, their anticipation and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">fantasy is confronted by the very real presence of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the mise en scene. Here they are featured in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">role of pseudo-physician, which is complicated by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">issues of consent, interior/exterior bodily access,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and their demands of the body (my body) as sound</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This outsider, exclusionary status that the viewer is assigned also comes with a controlling, medicalized,&nbsp;obstetrical gaze. In Canada and the United States, we&nbsp;employ much monitoring of women's bodies through&nbsp;our expectations of how women look, behave, act, and&nbsp;feel. These expectations are pathologized, reinforced,&nbsp;and legitimized through medicalized surveillance and&nbsp;control. Invasive and non-invasive examinations and&nbsp;procedures like ultrasounds, transvaginal probes, and&nbsp;visualizing and monitoring technologies are normalized for bodies marked female who are evaluated by a&nbsp;normalized and medicalized gaze in relationship to&nbsp;potentially housing or not housing a fetus (Balsamo).&nbsp;“Protection of the fetus is often offered as a com-monsensical, and, hence, ideological rationale for intervention into a woman's pregnancy, either through&nbsp;the actual application of invasive technologies or&nbsp;through the exercise of technologies of social monitoring and surveillance” (Clarke and Olesen). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Uterine</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Concert Hall </span><span class="font3">is not a place for babies, fetuses, or heteronormative determinism. However, it is a site that questions these cultural assumptions of women's bodies, of what we expect from bodies marked female, and&nbsp;why we think we have the right to make any kinds of&nbsp;demands on these bodies in the first place. This project&nbsp;does this by using digital technologies and affordances&nbsp;to interrupt their intended functions (i.e. playing music for a uterus-bond fetus from an adjacent vaginal canal) that contribute to the medicalized surveillance&nbsp;and control culture of women's bodies.</span></p>

This leads me to&nbsp;consider the intersection of labour, material culture,&nbsp;digital culture, and the sexual politics of place-making.&nbsp;At the same time, I consider the shift within digital culture that has happened with the emergence of social&nbsp;media as an organizing tool, and memes as political&nbsp;statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In my doctoral research in the Communication Studies program at Concordia University I have established, partially through an autoethnographic narrative, that independent and capitalist-alternative lesbian and queer women's nightlife organizing in Mexico&nbsp;City is a political project that responds to issues of economic gender disparity and spatial justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The small lesbian collective </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Meras efímeras</span><span class="font3"> was formed in 2005 by a group of friends I was a part of to&nbsp;organize nightlife alternatives for queer women in&nbsp;Mexico City. At the time, the main nighttime recreational events for queer women were “ladies' nights” at&nbsp;gay men's bars and clubs. Though inexpensive and&nbsp;conveniently located in the city's gay ghetto, these&nbsp;were not especially well organized; patrons could often find poor service, strip shows that made some feel&nbsp;uncomfortable and unclean facilities. It was evident&nbsp;that they were held to create a niche clientele on slow&nbsp;weeknights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Meras efímeras</span><span class="font3"> contended that within the capitalist logic of commercial nightlife, a queer women's crowd&nbsp;could not “compete” with an audience of gay men,&nbsp;making it virtually impossible to find women-oriented&nbsp;or women-welcoming queer events on the weekend.&nbsp;We, thus, understood that independently organizing&nbsp;nightlife implied taking a political stand on the economic disparity between men and women, and the issue of spatial justice for queer women in the urban&nbsp;nightscape. This also implied we could not expect to be&nbsp;paid for our work. And, as we were also unable to pay&nbsp;rent at a club, we had to physically adapt spaces or negotiate agreements at other types of venues outside of&nbsp;the gay ghetto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today's use of memes to make political statements, as well as the use of platforms such as Facebook event&nbsp;pages, Twitter and Instagram as an event organizing&nbsp;tools contrasts sharply with what it was like to call on&nbsp;a queer crowd for a political/social event around&nbsp;2005. Our main digital resource was a Yahoo! Groups&nbsp;mailing list to which we would manually add e-mails&nbsp;requested at the door of our events. We also advertised in the local LGBT free weeklies. But, the first&nbsp;point of contact were flyers we'd drop off at businesses&nbsp;or hand-out outside “ladies' nights” events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper I establish that the simultaneous use of paper-based and e-mail group based strategies </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Meras efímeras</span><span class="font3"> employed around 2005 constitute a presocial media-as-we-know-and-use-it-today organizing&nbsp;landscape that straddled material and digital culture.&nbsp;While this strategy was partially material and partially&nbsp;digital, it necessarily implied exchanges made physically; handing out of the flyer on the street, requesting&nbsp;and giving an e-mail at the door of an event. So, this&nbsp;paper also asks what are the stakes in queer women's&nbsp;nightlife organizing, as a political project, in the transfer from organizing strategies that implied a physical&nbsp;presence to current social media resources. Moreover,&nbsp;I ask if resources such as memes, Facebook event&nbsp;pages, Tweets or Instagram are capable of an effective&nbsp;transmedial drag; can they properly represent queer&nbsp;women's nightlife political world-views?</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
