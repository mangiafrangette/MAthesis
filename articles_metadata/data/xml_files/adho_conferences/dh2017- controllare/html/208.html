<p><span class="font7">Huygens ING, The Netherlands</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The study of literature has traditionally focused on the literary work, and sometimes its author, rather&nbsp;than on the response that works evoked in their&nbsp;readers. The arrival of the computer in the study of&nbsp;literature has not really changed that - perhaps&nbsp;unsurprisingly, as reader response has never been&nbsp;systematically recorded. The fact that readers have&nbsp;begun to document their reading and reading&nbsp;response on websites is therefore very fortunate&nbsp;(Gruzd and Rehberg Sedo, 2012, Maryl, 2008: 390406). Booksellers’ sites such as Amazon and review&nbsp;sites such as Goodreads, as well as weblogs, forums&nbsp;and general-purpose social media sites provide access&nbsp;to first-hand reading reports. Though most research&nbsp;on these sites focusses on (behavior of) users&nbsp;(Nakamura, 2013: 238-243, Thomas and Round, 2016:&nbsp;239-253), we are beginning to see them being used in&nbsp;literary research (Finn, 2011) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This paper presents the Online Dutch Book Response (ODBR) database, that was designed to&nbsp;facilitate research into book response. At present, the&nbsp;database holds reviews and other response items from&nbsp;an online bookseller as well as from four Dutch-language mass review sites, including, where&nbsp;available, the information about books, reviewers and&nbsp;sites necessary to put the reviews into context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To show one type of research that the database supports, the paper displays a clustering of reviews by&nbsp;genre, based on frequently used words. I discuss the&nbsp;clustering and what it suggests for further research.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Content: mass review sites, reviews from booksellers' sites, weblogs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While the ODBR database was designed to hold any kind of (online) book discussion, at the moment it&nbsp;holds 280,000 response items from four mass review&nbsp;sites: three from the Netherlands (hebban.nl, dizzie.nl&nbsp;and watleesjij.nu) and one from Flanders&nbsp;(lezerstippenlezers.be). It also holds 313,000 items&nbsp;from the main online bookseller in the Netherlands,&nbsp;bol.com, and 36,000 brief expert reviews. We are&nbsp;currently working on downloading about 400 book&nbsp;blogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mass review sites are sites where the main focus is on book reviews uploaded by the sites’ users. The best&nbsp;known example is Goodreads (goodreads.com)&nbsp;(Thelwall and Kousha, 2016: 972-983). Hebben.nl, for&nbsp;example, is currently the largest mass review site in&nbsp;the Dutch-language area. It is in many respects like&nbsp;Goodreads: users post reviews, they can follow other&nbsp;users and they can create book lists. Other users can&nbsp;respond to the reviews or vote them up or down.&nbsp;There are moderated reading clubs on specific books.&nbsp;Apart from the user-contributed content, Hebban also&nbsp;holds a fair amount of editorial material, among other&nbsp;things expert reviews, blog posts, interviews and&nbsp;giveaways.</span></p><img src="208_files/208-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:224pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1. Front page of Hebban.nl</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The other three sites are largely similar. Lezerstippenlezers.be (‘readers tip off readers’) is&nbsp;somewhat simpler in that it lacks the social functions&nbsp;of the other sites. Noteworthy about dizzie.nl is among&nbsp;other things that the site was downloaded for&nbsp;inclusion into the ODBR database only days before it&nbsp;was closed down. The site administrators explicitly&nbsp;stated in their final announcements that no archive&nbsp;would be kept. The ODBR database may be the most</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">complete record of the site’s existence. Since then, watleesjij.nu has also been closed down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ‘response' items (blogresponse, etc.) are responses to a response: a blogresponse is a response to a blogpost.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Database design and content</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of the database is to facilitate research into online book response. It should be able to store&nbsp;the response texts as well as information about the&nbsp;response’s context. Response items are not just&nbsp;reviews. They include book lists, expert reviews, blog&nbsp;posts and review responses and other response types.&nbsp;Ratings and tags are also stored in the database. Figure&nbsp;2 shows the main entities in the database.</span></p><img src="208_files/208-2.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:119pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 2. Main entities in ODBR database</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The database now contains the following numbers of records: 146,800 books, 58,000 user accounts, 40,000&nbsp;friendships/followers, and 628,800 book responses.&nbsp;The types of the responses are given in Table 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">This large collection of book response items and context information creates many different&nbsp;possibilities for research. First of all, the response&nbsp;texts facilitate the investigation of response to&nbsp;individual books, authors and genres. The texts show&nbsp;the norms that readers apply as well as the way&nbsp;reading affects them. The availability of expert reviews&nbsp;alongside general readers’ responses creates the&nbsp;possibility to study differences between (semiprofessional and lay reading. Other types of content&nbsp;enable different lines of research. Information about&nbsp;friends and followers can help investigate the&nbsp;influence of the social environment in reading choices&nbsp;and book appreciation. As many writers use the book&nbsp;review platforms to get in touch with their (potential)&nbsp;readers, the collected data can also provide insight&nbsp;into their marketing strategies. Information about the&nbsp;book lists that readers create (for instance ‘to read’,&nbsp;‘read in 2014’) shows which books are perceived as&nbsp;similar, prompting the question whether they will also&nbsp;be rated similarly. The integration of the discussions&nbsp;and the context information from multiple sites in a&nbsp;single environment that facilitates integrated&nbsp;querying is something that, as far as I know, has not&nbsp;been done before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unfortunately, because of copyright and privacy concerns, the database is not accessible over the web.&nbsp;Researchers who are interested in accessing its&nbsp;content are asked to contact the author.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Clustering by genre</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Of the research possibilities that the ODBR database offers, here I discuss just one example, an&nbsp;investigation in the word use in reviews by genre. This&nbsp;is an interesting subject, as word usage can be&nbsp;considered as an indication of how people respond to&nbsp;books. I will show a clustering of the genres by word&nbsp;use, which should give a first indication of which&nbsp;genres are perceived by readers as similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dutch publishers use a shared system for classifying their books. This so-called NUR code (an&nbsp;abbreviation meaning Dutch-language Uniform&nbsp;Categorization) covers aspects of format as well as&nbsp;genre. On some of the downloaded sites, books were&nbsp;assigned NUR codes. As the load process of the&nbsp;database tries to merge the book information from&nbsp;multiple sites, NUR codes are available for 75% of the&nbsp;reviews. In the computations, reviews were merged by&nbsp;NUR code. Relative frequencies were computed for all&nbsp;words, these frequencies were then transformed into&nbsp;z-scores. The Euclidean distances between the&nbsp;frequency vectors for the 200 most frequent words&nbsp;were computed and formed the basis for the clustering&nbsp;dendrogram in Figure 3. The figure only shows NUR&nbsp;codes for which there are more than 500 reviews&nbsp;available. For other choices for most frequent words&nbsp;and distance measure, the clustering is largely similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reviews by genre (NUR), 200 mfw</span></p><img src="208_files/208-3.jpg" style="width:233pt;height:161pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 3. Dendrogram of NUR codes, based on distances between word usage in the corresponding reviews. The&nbsp;colors of the NUR labels reflect a higher-order grouping of&nbsp;genres (see legend)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A number of interesting groupings appear: the literary novel, original and in translation, groups&nbsp;nicely with other literary fiction. At a higher scale&nbsp;literary fiction groups with literary nonfiction and,&nbsp;interestingly, with true stories. Fantasy groups with&nbsp;youth literature, maybe a reflection of its popularity&nbsp;among younger readers. A group of general popular&nbsp;fiction and romance is also close to youth literature.&nbsp;Perhaps the most remarkable in the clustering is the&nbsp;location of the literary thriller. It sits squarely on one&nbsp;branch with the other suspense books such as the&nbsp;regular thriller and the detective. Those who doubt&nbsp;whether the ‘literary’ in the literary thriller is more&nbsp;than a marketing label, will see their views confirmed&nbsp;by this clustering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Looking for an explanation, we can drill down to look at the individual words underlying the&nbsp;dendrogram and see for example how readers of&nbsp;(literary) thrillers talk about plot and plot lines, as one&nbsp;would expect. They also speak about 'main&nbsp;characters’(plural), while people who discuss&nbsp;literature use the singular 'main character’. That&nbsp;suggests an interesting difference between literature&nbsp;on the one hand and (literary) thrillers on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To praise a book, readers of literature use 'beautiful' and ‘nice’, readers of (literary) thrillers use ‘good’ or&nbsp;‘great’. For other observations I am still looking for an&nbsp;explanation. Why, for example, do people who discuss&nbsp;literature use more personal pronouns? That question,&nbsp;like many others, requires further investigation.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until now, most humanities-oriented researchers that have worked on online book discussion sites and&nbsp;communities have taken a qualitative approach&nbsp;(Fister, 2005: 303-309, Foasberg, 2012). The ODBR&nbsp;database is meant to facilitate quantitative research&nbsp;into online book discussion and, through the lens of&nbsp;online book discussion, into literature, both with&nbsp;respect to its effects on readers and as a social&nbsp;phenomenon. The rich data model and the large&nbsp;quantity of available data should provide support for&nbsp;both language and network oriented research&nbsp;approaches.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
