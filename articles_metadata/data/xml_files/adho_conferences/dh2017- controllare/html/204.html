<p><span class="font5">This paper reports on work in progress aimed at facilitating the creation, sharing, linking, and analysis&nbsp;of data about the movement of people, ideas, cultural&nbsp;practices, and commodities between places, over the&nbsp;course of history. Products of the Linked Places project&nbsp;include: conceptual and logical models for historical&nbsp;routes; a temporal extension of the popular GeoJSON&nbsp;data format, called GeoJSON-T; several varied&nbsp;exemplar data sets converted to GeoJSON-T format;&nbsp;prototype web software for browsing and visualizing&nbsp;that data; and Python scripts to convert data between&nbsp;CSV, GeoJSON-T, and RDF compatible with the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Pelagios&nbsp;Gazetteer Interconnection Format</span><span class="font5">. Substantial interim&nbsp;work products are shared in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Linked Places</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">GeoJSON-T</span><span class="font5"> GitHub repositories and have been&nbsp;reported in some detail in two blog posts (1, 2) .&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Motivation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A growing number of historical gazetteers are being developed in the course of digital humanities&nbsp;research projects (Berman, Mostern &amp; Southall, 2016).&nbsp;Their spatial temporal coverage is typically limited to&nbsp;a particular area and period due to factors of scholarly&nbsp;quality, cost, and relevance to a given project. Coverage&nbsp;extents do vary considerably, from a single city for a&nbsp;few generations to a region for several centuries. With&nbsp;few exceptions, these gazetteers are unpublished as&nbsp;such; instead they are spatial tables contained within,&nbsp;and integral to, the larger project data store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because historical gazetteers are difficult and timeconsuming to produce, it is vital they be published, when possible, in a way that permits linking them—an&nbsp;activity that the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Pelagios project</span><span class="font5"> has made great&nbsp;strides in facilitating. An emergent network of&nbsp;specialized gazetteers holds terrific promise, not only&nbsp;for re-use, but ultimately as a distributed, increasingly&nbsp;comprehensive geographical (i.e. spatial-temporal)&nbsp;index to linked data from numerous domains,&nbsp;including history, archaeology, literary studies,&nbsp;philology, and several of the social sciences. The focus&nbsp;of such an index, and encyclopedic applications it&nbsp;enables, will be on individual places, typically at the&nbsp;scales of cities and points of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such systems are highly desirable, but given a large volume of data about individual places we can also&nbsp;begin harvesting, creating, and sharing data about the&nbsp;connections between them. We should be able to ask&nbsp;of historical gazetteers: What journeys and historical&nbsp;routes has a given place been a waypoint on? And,&nbsp;what flows of people, ideas, and commodities has it&nbsp;been a source or sink for?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the Linked Places and GeoJSON-T projects have been undertaken with an even larger, “moonshot”&nbsp;vision in mind: a system allowing scholars and the&nbsp;general public to visualize and analyze the emergence,&nbsp;growth and spread of human settlements, their&nbsp;changing attributes, and the dynamic connections&nbsp;between them, including the diffusion of technologies&nbsp;and cultural practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To realize these ideas, we need a) lots of data, and b) methods and means for merging or linking them. In&nbsp;some respects, we are starting from scratch; data&nbsp;about historical movement is sparse and stored in&nbsp;disparate forms. Much of it will be newly generated, for&nbsp;example by parsing texts, transforming tabular&nbsp;records, or digitally tracing lines on historical maps.&nbsp;Merging and linking operations will require that the&nbsp;form of data from different sources (or abbreviated&nbsp;catalogues thereof) be either standardized (in the case&nbsp;of merging), or similar enough that automated&nbsp;alignment is feasible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The majority of works on geographic networks concerns physical media like roads and rail, whereas&nbsp;movement data is eventive. Geographers have&nbsp;modeled migration flows and disease diffusion for&nbsp;several decades, providing theoretical bases for their&nbsp;analysis that are outside our present scope. An&nbsp;overview of that work is found in (Lowe &amp; Moryadas&nbsp;1975). An excellent and more recent work on mobility&nbsp;and geographic movement is Tim Cresswell’s “On the&nbsp;Move” (2006). We are not aware of any efforts to model&nbsp;data for historical routes computationally, however&nbsp;the core abstraction we build upon is the traditional&nbsp;graph/network model of nodes and edges credited to&nbsp;18th century work of Euler (Biggs, et al 1986).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A Modeling Pattern</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Data modeling is as much an art as a science (Simsion &amp; Witt 2004), but some core best practices&nbsp;are well-known. A typical first step is establishing&nbsp;what entities are to be represented, what their&nbsp;essential attributes are, and what relationships obtain&nbsp;between them (cf. Chen, 1976). This step is often best&nbsp;accomplished collaboratively, in an iterative process&nbsp;undertaken by domain experts. Our results were&nbsp;immediately published to blog posts and relevant&nbsp;listservs, and the resulting input was useful in refining&nbsp;the model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the modeling context is an individual research project, it hardly matters what names are&nbsp;given those entities and relationships—only that the&nbsp;data store’s internal logic be sound and well&nbsp;understood by project members. But if, as in this case,&nbsp;the system will accommodate data from many sources&nbsp;or be accessed by others, we need to find broad&nbsp;agreement on a conceptual model and a vocabulary for&nbsp;its constituents between as many prospective&nbsp;participants as possible—that is, to describe the&nbsp;ontology of the research domain. Although much&nbsp;ontology engineering of this sort has involved&nbsp;comprehensive high-level ontologies such as the&nbsp;CIDOC-CRM , the development and implementation of&nbsp;small ontology design patterns (ODP) has been gaining&nbsp;favor since the introduction of that paradigm by Aldo&nbsp;Gangemi (2005). Such patterns, by any name, are&nbsp;“reusable successful solutions to a recurrent modeling&nbsp;problem” (definition provided by the Association for&nbsp;Ontology Design &amp; Patterns (ODPA) ) which can be&nbsp;used alone or assembled in modular fashion for larger&nbsp;requirements. Examples include patterns for “Place,”&nbsp;“Event,” “Participation,” and “Region.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And so the first step taken in the Linked Places project has been to develop an ontology design pattern&nbsp;for the historical movement of something between two&nbsp;or more places over some physical channel, either for&nbsp;some time during or throughout a timespan. The&nbsp;pattern, visualized in Figure 1, comprises the following&nbsp;conceptual understandings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A route describes an attestation of one or more occurrences of the movement of something (e.g.&nbsp;people, commodities, information) between two or&nbsp;more places, either for some time during or&nbsp;throughout a time_period. Routes are composed of one&nbsp;or more segment, each of which is composed of two&nbsp;places and a path (corresponding to nodes and edges&nbsp;in network parlance), the locations and temporal&nbsp;attributes for which may be unknown or unspecified.&nbsp;Movement between places occurred upon ways (the&nbsp;term used by OpenStreetMap) —physical channels&nbsp;such as roads, rivers, canals, railways, footpaths, and&nbsp;sea lanes—and may have been directional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three types of routes considered here are journeys, flows, and historical_routes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A journey is the record of a specific instance of travel by one or more individuals. Examples include:&nbsp;the 7th century pilgrimage of the Buddhist monk&nbsp;Xuanzang across China and India; the first voyage of&nbsp;Captain James Cook, between 1768 and 1771.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A flow is the record of the movement of something (commodities, people, ideas) between two places,&nbsp;aggregated as a magnitude over a period of time.&nbsp;Examples include: the transport of captive Africans&nbsp;between West Africa and Bahia in the 17th century;&nbsp;letters between certain correspondents in Paris and&nbsp;Prague in the 18th century; a source network of late&nbsp;Neolithic obsidian artifacts and known source&nbsp;locations on the Anatolian Plateau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A historical_route asserts a single or composite named course of travel between places, taken&nbsp;repeatedly by unspecified individuals over time,&nbsp;usually for purposes of commerce. Examples include&nbsp;the Silk Road and the Amber Routes. Some correspond&nbsp;with named roads, for instance the Via Salaria in Italy&nbsp;is both a way and a historical_route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additional axioms indicated by the relations and cardinality expressions (e.g. 0...*) in Figure 1 include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All routes are sourced, normally to textual or&nbsp;cartographic documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way for a segment (its physical path</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">described by a geometry) may be known and represented,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unknown, or ignored</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Segments with unspecified ways will typically be visualized as a line or arc)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each segment has one or more temporal&nbsp;attribute (“when”), which can be a&nbsp;time_period, (possibly named) or a sequence&nbsp;(e.g. after segment n)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Routes and their component segments can&nbsp;have any number of attributes (properties),&nbsp;dependent upon data sources and project&nbsp;requirements</span></p><img src="204_files/204-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:223pt;"/>
<p><span class="font1">Figure 1. A conceptual model for historical movement (routes</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ontology pattern we introduce here is specialized, as compared to high level ontologies like&nbsp;CIDOC-CRM. We have not yet mapped our distinctive&nbsp;entities (route, journey, flow, historical_route,&nbsp;segment, when) to existing ontologies. The term place&nbsp;is commonly found, but usually is synonymous with&nbsp;location; the sense we are adopting is that of the&nbsp;Pleiades gazetteer, but is not in a published ontology&nbsp;that we're aware of. In any case, we feel it is best to first&nbsp;lay down a logically coherent set of terms and at a later&nbsp;date attempt to align them with other ontologies.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Formats</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The route ODP has informed our development and implementation of recommended standard data&nbsp;formats. It turns out all three types of routes can be&nbsp;effectively described in GeoJSON-T, an extended&nbsp;version of GeoJSON, the widely-used format for&nbsp;representing geographic FeatureCollections. A&nbsp;FeatureCollection of routes will include both Place and&nbsp;Route features. Route segments are articulated as an&nbsp;array of one or more geometries in a route’s&nbsp;GeometryCollection. GeoJSON-T allows optional&nbsp;“when” objects, both for each feature at the same level&nbsp;as its geometry object and for segment geometries&nbsp;(Figure 2). Features and segments have certain&nbsp;required properties as shown, and can have unlimited&nbsp;project-specific properties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To date, seven exemplar datasets have been converted from a typical CSV format to GeoJSON-T,&nbsp;using a newly developed Python program. Three are&nbsp;for journeys: two by individuals (a 7th century&nbsp;pilgrimage and a modern circumnavigation), the third&nbsp;by 840 Venetian ship convoys in the 13-15th centuries.&nbsp;Another dataset aggregates those ship journeys as&nbsp;flows having magnitudes of journeys and ships. The&nbsp;last three are historical_routes: the Roman era&nbsp;itinerary of the Vicarello Beakers, the route system&nbsp;between courier stations in Ming Dynasty China, and a&nbsp;large set of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Old World” trade and pilgrimage routes</span><span class="font5"> .&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Software</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The widespread adoption of GeoJSON has demonstrated that for a data format to be useful, there&nbsp;must be software with visualization and analysis&nbsp;capabilities that supports it. Accordingly, an essential&nbsp;element of the Linked Places project is development of&nbsp;proof of concept web software to render GeoJSON-T&nbsp;data, for both routes and places alone, to a map and&nbsp;timeline together. The development of that software is&nbsp;ongoing, and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">publicly available</span><span class="font5">.
