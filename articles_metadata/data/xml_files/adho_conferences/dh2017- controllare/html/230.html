<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Replication, Visualization &amp; Tactility: Towards a Deeper&nbsp;Involvement of 3D Printing&nbsp;in Humanities Scholarship&nbsp;and Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Aaron Tucker</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><a href="mailto:atucker@ryerson.ca">atucker@ryerson.ca</a></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ryerson University, Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a chapter that begins with the question “What would you make it you had a machine that could make&nbsp;anything?” Lipson and Kurman rhapsodically&nbsp;illustrate the myriad uses for 3D printing, from “3D&nbsp;prints [of] a precise, highly detailed replica of [a] fetus”&nbsp;to “the not so distant future [where] people will print&nbsp;3D living tissue, nutritionally calibrated foods, and&nbsp;ready-made, fully assembled electronic components”&nbsp;(7). On-campus maker spaces often tout 3D printers&nbsp;with the same utopian vigor, yet there is still a great&nbsp;deal of opacity around how introducing 3D printed&nbsp;objects into a Humanities classroom or scholarship&nbsp;would add value to those spaces or work. In my&nbsp;experience collaborating and working in the Digital&nbsp;Media Experience Lab at Ryerson University, when&nbsp;asked to speak with colleagues or students about the&nbsp;potentials for projects that involve 3D printing, two&nbsp;main types of anxiety arise: first, there is the&nbsp;intimidation that comes with learning a new set of&nbsp;hardware and software; and second, there is a large&nbsp;amount of trepidation around what to the technology&nbsp;should even be used for. While the first set of fears can&nbsp;be somewhat mitigated by the sort of community-friendly maker space environment that 3D printers&nbsp;are often housed in, the second set of concerns asks&nbsp;questions that are at the root of not just 3D printing in&nbsp;the Humanities, but Digital Humanities (DH) projects&nbsp;as a whole:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">What are the elements of 3D printing that make it a unique contribution to the&nbsp;Humanities? What are the technology’s&nbsp;strengths and how might they best be&nbsp;harnessed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">What are the limits of such a technology,&nbsp;from both the hardware and software&nbsp;perspectives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">As a physical object imbued with potential&nbsp;meaning, how might an tactile object speak&nbsp;to issues of critical theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">What are the components of 3D printing that&nbsp;lend itself to a powerful learning or scholarly&nbsp;environment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">What can 3D printing do that other modes of&nbsp;interface, data visualization cannot?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Scholars like Mark Stefik explains that “digital sensemaking” most often takes place in the&nbsp;ecosystems of “digital information infrastructure, such&nbsp;as today’s web and search engines” and, as such, a&nbsp;great number of projects focus on a DH understanding&nbsp;of digital sensemaking centre around the digital&nbsp;components of virtual object creation. Yet, as Ian&nbsp;Foster argues, “Informational technology can also&nbsp;enhance our abilities to make sense of information, for&nbsp;example, by allowing exploration via visual&nbsp;metaphors” (19). 3D printed objects have the unique&nbsp;ability to make physical/concrete, at varying scales&nbsp;with easy replication, abstract ideas and give scholars&nbsp;and students modes of engagement with metaphors&nbsp;and issues and are not present in other mediums&nbsp;(print, film, music, etc). Drawing from theory and&nbsp;history around sculpture, this paper will ask anyone&nbsp;wanting to begin a 3D printed project, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">what </span><span class="font3">the object&nbsp;they wish to create a metaphor for is, as a physical&nbsp;object imbued with potential meaning. If a student or&nbsp;scholar wants to speak to certain issues, what objects&nbsp;might be the best metaphors for the arguments and&nbsp;issues they wish to discuss? What does adding the&nbsp;layer of technology in 3D printing then add to that&nbsp;argument? What do the specific properties of&nbsp;replication, visualization and tactility add to the&nbsp;metaphor and the argument being made? 3D Printing&nbsp;then becomes another mode to explore visual&nbsp;metaphors but with the unique and obvious&nbsp;understanding that such an object is immediately and&nbsp;equally digital and analog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rooted in Jentery Sayer’s work in discussing 3D printing alongside Lipson and Kurman’s “10 principles&nbsp;of 3D printing” (20-24), this paper will begin to answer&nbsp;the above questions by outlining three core&nbsp;considerations, with examples, in an attempt to foster&nbsp;further discussion about how a relatively nascent&nbsp;popular technology might best be understood and&nbsp;undertaken in a Digital Humanities project or&nbsp;classroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First, the nature of 3D printing is built around the notion of replication: once virtual objects are&nbsp;constructed, they can be repeatedly printed quickly&nbsp;and easily. This is a massive strength when&nbsp;considering a large scale multitudinous project, or a&nbsp;classroom environment wherein students may be&nbsp;asked to each design or find and print an object. When&nbsp;printing with recyclable material, the technology lends&nbsp;itself exceptionally well to iteration, encouraging&nbsp;prototyping and low-risk failure in service of a&nbsp;finished product. However, the notion of replication&nbsp;also extends to the technology’s ability to mirror “real&nbsp;life” (and future, fantasy) objects: projects like&nbsp;Morehshin Allahyari’s Material Speculation are able to&nbsp;recreate lost objects destroyed by ISIS and reprint&nbsp;them, effectively regenerating a version of the physical&nbsp;object that both evokes the original and challenges its&nbsp;audience by layering the technological on top of the&nbsp;original craftsmanship/artistry. I will blend this with&nbsp;discussion of Odile Fillod’s project printing models of&nbsp;the clitoris as an educational and feminist tool of&nbsp;inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second, 3D printing allows creative and untapped modes of visualizing data. A number of data&nbsp;visualization tools, especially for beginners in DH, are&nbsp;going to be relatively simple 2D graphics, such as&nbsp;charts, graphs, maps etc; advanced tools will include&nbsp;movement, interactivity, and pleasant aesthetics. Yet,&nbsp;the interfaces that 3D printed objects promote are&nbsp;distinctive in their mix of the physical and virtual.&nbsp;Using examples from Lipson and Kurman’s chapter “A&nbsp;Factory in the Classroom,” as well as my own work&nbsp;with translating poems into small landscapes-type&nbsp;pieces via a height map application as part of Loss Sets,&nbsp;it is clear that 3D printing offers a wealth of&nbsp;opportunities to translate numbers, words, spaces&nbsp;into objects; in doing so, the object is pushed into an&nbsp;analog space that challenges its audience to “read” and&nbsp;“understand” that data in an embodied and physical&nbsp;manner that maintains the pleasingly interactive and&nbsp;evocative arguments about the information selected&nbsp;often found in virtual data visualization tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lastly, 3D printed objects have a sensual tactility that is difficult to get from other (virtual) elements of&nbsp;Humanities scholarship. Once printed, the objects&nbsp;have concrete weight and volume that points to a set&nbsp;of aesthetic values again straddling their digitalanalog nature; they can be picked up, turned over, and&nbsp;explored from a multitude of angles. Too, as wearable&nbsp;computing increases, 3D printed fabric projects an&nbsp;engaged scholarship linked immediately to the&nbsp;sensations and shapes of the body. Generating projects&nbsp;that take advantage of the physicality and materiality&nbsp;of such objects can be an exceptionally effective and&nbsp;emotive mode to considering virtual or past objects,&nbsp;especially as printed objects can be treated, postprinting, to change the plastic’s original properties. To&nbsp;this end I will be looking closely at Neri Oxman and the&nbsp;Mediated Matter Group’s Lazurus and Vespers, a&nbsp;“series of death masks” as well as Donna Szoke’s&nbsp;Decoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before considering potential software or materials and hardware, a DH project involving 3D printing will&nbsp;be most effective if it begins by considering these&nbsp;principles, understanding the strengths and core of&nbsp;the technology itself, and then blending each element&nbsp;together into a symbiotic environment in which the&nbsp;object itself is capable of housing the necessary&nbsp;evocative complexity and wonder that the technology&nbsp;itself often provokes.</span></p>
