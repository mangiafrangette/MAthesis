<p><span class="font2">We aim to demonstrate a new methodology for detecting shifting nuances of ideas in Chinese&nbsp;intellectual history. Our subject is Chen Duxiu (18791942), founder of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&nbsp;and one of the most important historical figures of&nbsp;twentieth century China. We combine the latest textmining tools with statistical analysis and natural&nbsp;language law, based on word frequency calculations.&nbsp;Because the Chinese language does not have spaces&nbsp;between words, and because each word is comprised&nbsp;of either a single or multiple characters or&nbsp;morphemes, segmentation of Chinese text poses a set&nbsp;of different challenges than for English corpus. By&nbsp;using a Chinese tokenization plug-in for R called&nbsp;JiebaR, we have developed a more precise method to&nbsp;create a Chinese natural language curve that conforms&nbsp;closely to Zipf’s law, a commonly used model for&nbsp;distribution of words in a corpus. Zipf s law states that&nbsp;given a body of natural language text, the frequency of&nbsp;any word is inversely proportional to its rank. (Ha et&nbsp;al., 2003) For Chinese language, Zipf’s law applies for&nbsp;words made up of multiple morphemes. (Xiao, 2008)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our assumption is that a word is significant when its position on our curve deviates from the fitted curve&nbsp;based on Zipf’s law. Departing from an existing&nbsp;method developed by Prof. Jin’s team, we created two&nbsp;groups of keywords, and called them “anchor” and&nbsp;“companion” words. (Jin et al., 2014) “Anchor” words&nbsp;have large residuals (high deviation from the standard&nbsp;curve), and “companion” words have a high&nbsp;correlation with “anchor” words. We used the formula&nbsp;for Pearson’s correlation coefficient to find the&nbsp;companion words. The coefficient has a value of&nbsp;between +1 and -1. The companion words provide the&nbsp;context with which to interpret the anchor words.&nbsp;Unlike Prof. Jin’s team, we included keywords made up&nbsp;of more than two characters, such as the three&nbsp;character word for Nationalist party, Guomindang (</span><span class="font1">H&nbsp;SS</span><span class="font2">), the four character word for citizen’s assembly,&nbsp;guomin huiyi(</span><span class="font1">HSW^</span><span class="font2">), and the five character word&nbsp;for Marxism, makesizhuyi</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The goal of our research is to analyze changing meaning of the concept of patriotism in Chen’s writing&nbsp;from the beginning of his publishing career, ca. 1897,&nbsp;to the end of his life, 1942. Why is Chen such a&nbsp;fascinating figure to study? In addition to creating a&nbsp;political party that changed the course of Chinese&nbsp;history, Chen was equally, if not more, influential in&nbsp;bringing about the first cultural revolution of&nbsp;twentieth century China. Living at a time of great&nbsp;political unrest, Chen wrote passionately on the need&nbsp;to reform the people by revolutionizing Chinese&nbsp;culture, thoughts, and politics. After founding the CCP&nbsp;in 1920-21, Chen was expelled from the party in 1929&nbsp;due to ideological differences. He was subsequently&nbsp;jailed by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist Party, and died&nbsp;a political pariah a few years later. As his political and&nbsp;personal fortune waxed and waned, Chen’s conception&nbsp;of patriotism shifted. For this paper, we chose six&nbsp;important anchor words: citizen (</span><span class="font1">HS</span><span class="font2">), youth (</span><span class="font1">W^</span><span class="font2">),&nbsp;democracy (</span><span class="font1">S^</span><span class="font2">), revolution (</span><span class="font1">¥^</span><span class="font2">), people (</span><span class="font1">S^</span><span class="font2">)&nbsp;and being patriotic (</span><span class="font1">SH</span><span class="font2">). Our method is replicable&nbsp;for other corpus, with the understanding that the&nbsp;conclusion is derived with the additional layer of&nbsp;human deliberation.</span></p>
