<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We start from the assertion that coding and code— as the source code of computer programs that is&nbsp;readable to humans and which drives the&nbsp;performative nature of software (Ford 2015, Hiller&nbsp;2015)—can be inherent parts of scholarship or&nbsp;scholarship by and of themselves. That is: we assert&nbsp;that code can be scholarly, that coding can be&nbsp;scholarship, and that there is little difference between&nbsp;the authorship of code or text (Van Zundert 2016). The&nbsp;dichotomy that has been often sought between on the&nbsp;one hand a ‘pure’ intellectual realm associated with&nbsp;scholarly writing and academic print publication, and&nbsp;on the other hand the ‘material labour’ associated with&nbsp;for instance instrument making or programing, is&nbsp;artificial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We argue the validity of this assertion along Burgess and Hamming (2011) and Clement (2016).&nbsp;These scholars refer to earlier work in which Bruno&nbsp;Latour (1993) casts the defining characteristic of&nbsp;modernity as a process of ‘purification’ which aims to&nbsp;contrast the human culture of modernity to nature.&nbsp;Burgess and Hamming observe a congruent process in&nbsp;academia: “Within the academy we see these&nbsp;processes of purification and mediation at work,&nbsp;producing and maintaining the distinction between&nbsp;intellectual labor and material labor, both of which are&nbsp;essential to multimedia production” (Burgess &amp;&nbsp;Hamming 2011:^11). This process serves to&nbsp;distinguish between scholarly and non-scholarly&nbsp;activities: “The distinction between intellectual and&nbsp;material labor is pervasive throughout scholarly&nbsp;criticism and evaluation of media forms. [...] In&nbsp;addition, any discussion of scholarly activities in&nbsp;multimedia format are usually elided in favor of&nbsp;literary texts, which can be safely analyzed using&nbsp;traditional tools of critical analysis.” However, this&nbsp;distinction is based upon a technological fallacy&nbsp;already pointed out—as Burgess and Hamming note—&nbsp;by Richard Grusin in 1984. Grusin argued that&nbsp;Hypertext has not changed the nature of text&nbsp;essentially, as writing has always already been&nbsp;hypertextual through the use of indices, notes,&nbsp;annotations, and intertextual references. To assume&nbsp;that the technology of Hypertext has unvealed or&nbsp;revolutionary activated the associative nature of text,&nbsp;amounts to the fallacy of ascribing the associative&nbsp;agency of cognition to the technology, which however&nbsp;is of course a ‘mere’ expression of that agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Analogous to Burgess and Hamming, we argue that relegating the evaluation of scholarship to the&nbsp;reviewing of print publications is an equal fallacious&nbsp;ascribing of agency to the technology of written text.&nbsp;Such a narrow understanding of scholarship&nbsp;presupposes that something is scholarship because it&nbsp;is in writing, that writing makes it scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is possible to evade all such possible technological fallacies by understanding scholarship&nbsp;as argument. We argue therefore that scholarship in&nbsp;essence is argument, and that technologies enable to&nbsp;shape and express that argument. This is not to say&nbsp;that technologies are mere inert and neutral&nbsp;epistemological tools, obviously different technologies&nbsp;shape and affect argument in different ways. Different&nbsp;technologies can therefore enrich scholarly argument.&nbsp;Scholarship is thus not bound to the use of text as an&nbsp;epistemological technology, but essentially is in the&nbsp;shaping of an argument. Text and writing may still be&nbsp;the most celebrated semiotic technologies to express&nbsp;an argument, but computer code understood as ‘just&nbsp;another’ literacy (cf. Knuth 1984, Kittler 1993, Vee&nbsp;2013) can equally be the carrier of scholarly argument.&nbsp;However, the acceptance of code as another form of&nbsp;scholarly argument presents problems to the current&nbsp;scholarly process of evaluation because of a lack of&nbsp;well developed methods for reviewing and critiquing&nbsp;scholarly code. Digital humanities as a site of&nbsp;production of non conventional research outputs—&nbsp;digital editions, web based publications, new&nbsp;analytical method, and computational tools for&nbsp;instance—has spurred the debate on evaluative&nbsp;practices in the humanities considerably, exactly&nbsp;because practitioners of digital scholarship&nbsp;acknowledge that much of the relevant scholarship is&nbsp;not expressed in the form of traditional scholarly&nbsp;output. Yet the focus of review generally remains on&nbsp;“the fiction of ‘final outputs’ in digital scholarship”&nbsp;(Nowviskie 2011), on old form peer review&nbsp;(Antonijevic 2016), and on approximating&nbsp;equivalencies of digital content and traditional print&nbsp;publication (Presner 2012). Discussions around the&nbsp;evaluation of digital scholarship have thus “tended to&nbsp;focus primarily on establishing digital work as&nbsp;equivalent to print publications to make it count&nbsp;instead of considering how digital scholarship might&nbsp;transform knowledge practices” (Purdy &amp; Walker&nbsp;2010:178, Anderson &amp; McPherson, 2011). As a&nbsp;reaction digital scholars have stressed how peer&nbsp;review of digital scholarship should foremost consider&nbsp;how digital scholarship is different from conventional&nbsp;scholarship. They argue that review should be focused&nbsp;on the process of developing, building, and knowledge&nbsp;creation (Nowviskie 2011), on the contrast and&nbsp;overlap between the representationality of&nbsp;conventional scholarship and the strong performative&nbsp;aspects of digital scholarship (Burgess &amp; Hamming&nbsp;2011), and on the medium specificity of digital&nbsp;scholarship (Rockwell 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The debate on peer review in digital scholarship however, has been geared much to high-level&nbsp;evaluation, concentrating for instance on the issue&nbsp;how digital scholarship could be reviewed in the&nbsp;context of tenure track evaluations. Very little has&nbsp;been proposed as to concrete techniques and methods&nbsp;for more practical level applied peer review of&nbsp;program code. Existing practical guidance pertains to&nbsp;digital objects such as digital editions (Sahle &amp; Vogler&nbsp;2014) or to code as cultural artefact (Marino 2006),&nbsp;but no substantial work has been put forward on how&nbsp;to peer review scholarly code. We are left with the&nbsp;rather general statement that “traditional humanities&nbsp;standards need to be part of the mix, [but] the domain&nbsp;is too different for them to be applied without&nbsp;considerable adaptation” (Smithies 2012), and the&nbsp;often echoed contention that digital artefacts should&nbsp;be evaluated as such and not as to how they might&nbsp;have been documented in conventional articles. The&nbsp;latter argument probably most succinctly put by&nbsp;Geoffrey Rockwell (2011): “While such narratives are&nbsp;useful to evaluators [...] they should never be a&nbsp;substitute for review of the work in the form it was&nbsp;produced in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yet, the problem is growing more urgent. Increasingly, code is created and used as a mechanism&nbsp;of analysis in textual scholarship and literary&nbsp;studies—cf. for instance Enderle 2016, Jockers 2013,&nbsp;Piper 2015, Rybicki et al. 2014, and Underwood&nbsp;2014—which leads to the need to evaluate the&nbsp;technical, methodological and epistemological&nbsp;qualities of such code, as for instance the ‘Syuzhet case’&nbsp;showed (Swafford 2016). The algorithms, code, and&nbsp;software that underpins the analyses in these&nbsp;examples of scholarship are not standardized ‘off the&nbsp;shelf’ software productions. These code bases are&nbsp;nothing like a software package or product such as&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">AntConc</span><span class="font3"> that can be viewed as a generic and packaged&nbsp;distributable tool; a tool that might be subject to a&nbsp;scholarly type of tool criticism explaining and opening&nbsp;it for reuse by other scholars. Instead these codebases&nbsp;are bespoke code: they are one-off highly specific and&nbsp;complex analytical engines, tailored to solving one&nbsp;highly specific research question based on one specific&nbsp;set of data. Reuse, scalability, and ease-of-use are,&nbsp;justifiably (Baldrigde 2015), not specific aims of these&nbsp;code objects at all. Such might be the case with generic&nbsp;software, but these programs have been algorithmic&nbsp;instruments tailor made to serve the research case at&nbsp;hand. As such—and following what was argued&nbsp;above—we must regard these code bases as an&nbsp;inherent part of the scholarly argument they&nbsp;contribute to. And as such they deserve and require&nbsp;specific and rigorous peer review, like any argument&nbsp;in humanities research. How such peer review should&nbsp;be conducted is, however, a large unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a contribution to the challenges of code peer review we present an experimental technique we call&nbsp;defactoring. Drawing on Braithwaite (2013), we have&nbsp;re-configured the program code that underpins a&nbsp;recent article by Ted Underwood and Jordan Sellers&nbsp;(Underwood &amp; Sellers 2016) into a computational&nbsp;narrative—echoing Knuth’s literate programming&nbsp;(1984)—to be critically analyzed and annotated. This&nbsp;method is intimately intertwined with the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Jupyter&nbsp;Notebook</span><span class="font3"> platform, which allows for the composition&nbsp;of scholarly and scientific inscriptions that are&nbsp;simultaneously human and machine readable. The&nbsp;Notebook is both a document format and a platform&nbsp;for mixing code and prose into executable objects. We&nbsp;have extracted Underwood and Seller’s code and&nbsp;defactored it into a Jupyter Notebook, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/interedition/paceofchange">https://github.com/interedition/paceofchange</a>. This&nbsp;means we have recombined code from disparate files,&nbsp;linearized the execution path, demodularized function&nbsp;calls, and annotated code blocks with our own&nbsp;expository comments. As an annotated Notebook we&nbsp;can now engage Underwood and Seller’s code directly&nbsp;as a scholarly inscription and more deeply interrogate&nbsp;the role of data, algorithms, and code in the production&nbsp;of knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the case of scholarship that uses computation, large parts of the intellectual importance are&nbsp;embodied in the code rather than living exclusively in&nbsp;the print publication. As our case study also shows,&nbsp;usually the method description in the print publication&nbsp;presents the intellectual contribution of the code&nbsp;development in a very reduced, and rather imprecise&nbsp;high-level fashion. The code itself is a more precise&nbsp;inscription of the analysis the researchers conducted.&nbsp;The methodological approach we present is a way to&nbsp;engage the code, and thus allows a peer reviewer to&nbsp;understand and interpret the intellectual narrative of&nbsp;the code. This results in a fuller grasp and&nbsp;understanding of the methods applied, and thus to a&nbsp;more comprehensive review of the intellectual effort&nbsp;associated with the publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After demonstrating the work in the notebook, we will conclude our paper with a critical reflection of the&nbsp;reviewing work that was undertaken with it. We&nbsp;identify the applicability, feasibility, benefits, and&nbsp;drawbacks of this specific approach. We also outline&nbsp;some possible future directions of research that could&nbsp;further contribute to exploring review methods for&nbsp;code scholarship.</span></p>
