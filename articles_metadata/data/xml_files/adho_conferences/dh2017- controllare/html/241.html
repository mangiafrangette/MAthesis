<p><span class="font5">The study of nineteenth-century Africa is troubled by issues of access on two fronts. First, explorers’&nbsp;unedited field notes - the closest thing we have to a&nbsp;“‘raw’ record” - are rarely available, and, if they are,&nbsp;they are often crumbling, illegible, or located in far-flung archives (Bridges 1998). Second, even when&nbsp;such sources are available in later published forms,&nbsp;they present ethical and ideological problems. Written&nbsp;largely by European explorers and heavily edited, the&nbsp;published texts often exclude the voices of the very&nbsp;populations to which they attempt to provide access.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Livingstone Online</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> a digital project dedicated to the&nbsp;written and visual legacy of nineteenth-century&nbsp;explorer David Livingstone (1813-73), works to&nbsp;counter these issues through its site design,&nbsp;transcription processes, and use of spectral imaging&nbsp;technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to do so, however, we have had to reconsider our understanding of access, both&nbsp;technologically and ideologically. As a publicly-funded&nbsp;project, we adhere to a high standard of transparency.&nbsp;Yet, as an archive of a contentious figure of imperial&nbsp;exploration, we are also responsive to the recent&nbsp;critiques of access - both of open access as privileging&nbsp;imperial knowledge expansion (Christen 2012; Risam&nbsp;2017) and of the digital humanities as excluding&nbsp;consideration of race (Gallon 2016). To navigate this&nbsp;conflict, we strive to provide access that is not simply&nbsp;based on openness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead, our project offers an understanding of access that moves in two directions temporally:&nbsp;striving to repair the past by being ethical in our digital&nbsp;treatment and remediation of historical materials,&nbsp;while also acting in a future-oriented fashion in&nbsp;developing and implementing our transparency&nbsp;policies, data standards, and code of collaboration in&nbsp;order to engage a variety of audiences, including those&nbsp;often excluded from DH practice. In this way, our&nbsp;project attempts to create a digital platform for&nbsp;culturally sensitive materials, while our&nbsp;documentation procedures seek to reveal every step&nbsp;of our decision-making process to critical review.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Reparative</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Livingstone Online,</span><span class="font5"> now in its twelfth year (2004 present), is a digital museum and library that draws on&nbsp;recent scholarship and international collaboration to&nbsp;restore one of the British Empire's most iconic figures&nbsp;to his global contexts. Our digital collection of highresolution manuscript images and critically-edited&nbsp;transcriptions - 11,000 images and 700 transcriptions&nbsp;by 2017 - is among the largest on the internet related&nbsp;to any single historical British visitor to Africa. Our site&nbsp;publishes important research on Livingstone's legacy&nbsp;and explores the many ways his ideas have circulated&nbsp;over time. Uniquely, we also takes its visitors far&nbsp;behind the scenes of our work - documenting step-bystep the international collaboration among archives,&nbsp;scholars, scientists, librarians, computer&nbsp;programmers, and other specialists that has made our&nbsp;project possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our use of spectral imaging to uncover the material history of Livingstone’s manuscripts gives us&nbsp;important insights into the conditions under which&nbsp;Livingstone and other imperial explorers wrote - from&nbsp;unacknowledged contributors to the many&nbsp;environments through which the manuscripts&nbsp;circulated. In foregrounding these dimensions, we are&nbsp;also creating a new approach to using spectral imaging&nbsp;in cultural heritage projects because spectral imaging&nbsp;has primarily been used to unearth layers of text,&nbsp;rather than to examine the broader circumstances of&nbsp;imperial record-making and the preservation of&nbsp;imperial records over time. This new use of spectral&nbsp;imaging also constitutes an ethics of access, which is&nbsp;framed by critical essays that explore Livingstone’s&nbsp;uncredited information sources. Livingstone Online&nbsp;here puts forward an idea of access as uncovering the&nbsp;hidden hands and voices of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For instance, in our study of Livingstone’s 1871 Field Diary, we have collaborated with spectral&nbsp;imaging scientists to develop pseudocolor (false color)&nbsp;images to differentiate passages that Livingstone&nbsp;originally wrote from those he added latter and those&nbsp;added by other hands. Likewise, the development of&nbsp;animated spectral images has enabled a chronological&nbsp;reconstruction of events in the life of the diary. By&nbsp;contrast, recourse to images made by principal&nbsp;component analysis (PCA) has uncovered stains on&nbsp;pages otherwise invisible to the naked eye and has&nbsp;introduced us to dimensions of manuscript history&nbsp;otherwise not even suspected to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition, we frame these spectral images with paratextual tools that value equally the different kinds&nbsp;of information that Livingstone records. For example,&nbsp;few or no other record remains of many of the villages&nbsp;or the African and Arab individuals Livingstone&nbsp;mentions. As a result, our integrated glossary offers&nbsp;unique, otherwise unavailable geographical&nbsp;information that circulated during Livingstone's time&nbsp;in Central Africa and enumerates the names of people&nbsp;that might otherwise be lost to history. The glossary&nbsp;and other critical materials also provide insight into&nbsp;the complex social dynamics that operated in areas&nbsp;where Livingstone traveled. Overall, Livingstone&nbsp;Online offers a version of access in which the freely&nbsp;available manuscript pages are only a starting point;&nbsp;spectral imaging technology combined with critical&nbsp;building helps construct a reparative ethos of access.</span></p><img src="241_files/241-1.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:181pt;"/>

<p><span class="font5">Alongside such reparative work, we also strive to design a project that looks toward the future.&nbsp;Livingstone Online makes our project documents&nbsp;available to an almost unprecedented degree in order&nbsp;to make our publicly-funded research fully&nbsp;accountable, to illuminate our work practices, and to&nbsp;support future digital projects. Our extensive&nbsp;downloadable primary materials (including 12,000&nbsp;images, 3000 metadata records, and hundreds of&nbsp;transcriptions) are supplemented by freely available&nbsp;project materials, images, and working documents -the things often hidden behind the public face of digital&nbsp;projects. We have curated access to over 600 project&nbsp;documents, including planning documents, spectral&nbsp;image processing information, and essay notes, in&nbsp;order to illuminate the long-term history of our&nbsp;project work. Likewise, access to our grant narratives&nbsp;and working documents de-mystifies funding&nbsp;processes and international, interdisciplinary&nbsp;collaboration in order to support the work of other&nbsp;scholars, especially junior or independent scholars&nbsp;and those new to DH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition, our site is technically accessible in a range of ways. We have built the site with sustainable,&nbsp;community-supported, open-source technologies&nbsp;such as Drupal for our front end and Fedora for our&nbsp;back end, which means that others can access our&nbsp;underlying code (which is fully available from Github)&nbsp;to reuse and modify it for their own projects. To&nbsp;promote use of our site more broadly, we've also&nbsp;worked to make the site inviting to scholars and&nbsp;general users alike, using intuitive, visually-driven site&nbsp;design. Through our site design, open-source code,&nbsp;and transparent documentation, we hope to foster&nbsp;user-led interpretation over passive reception of&nbsp;authorized knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Figures 2,3. Livingstone Online's six section pages, two of which are pictured here, each rely on a diverse range of&nbsp;historical illustrations and contemporary images to&nbsp;complicate the notion of a definitive Livingstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As part of this effort, our site is also fully mobile accessible, including for complex functions such as the&nbsp;review and study of archival manuscripts and&nbsp;transcriptions. This opens up Livingstone’s documents&nbsp;and our critical materials to the parts of the world&nbsp;where he worked and travelled; for many people on&nbsp;the African continent, for instance, mobile technology&nbsp;is the main access point to the internet. Likewise, just&nbsp;under a quarter of our collaborating archives are in&nbsp;Africa, and we are actively working on developing&nbsp;additional relationships with African-based archives,&nbsp;in the interests of not only bringing new Livingstone&nbsp;materials into our site, but also to encourage&nbsp;collaboration with African-based scholars and general&nbsp;audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In these ways, we hope to initiate a conversation about the biases and assumptions inherent in the ways&nbsp;that technological advances shape our preservation of&nbsp;the past. We also hope to develop a nuanced practice&nbsp;of access that is embedded in our site design, spectral&nbsp;imaging processing, and transparent documentation,&nbsp;as well as made explicit in our critical materials.&nbsp;Thinking of access beyond openness means creating&nbsp;more historically-minded digital collections that also&nbsp;look to future knowledge creation by an array of&nbsp;populations, not all of them academic or based in the&nbsp;west.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
