<p><span class="font3">As humanities scholars embrace digital research and more content is digitized, tools and methods such&nbsp;as text mining and spatial analysis become increasingly more vital, especially to graduate students who&nbsp;are at a formative stage in their careers. Librarians and&nbsp;library staff are keen to support these researchers and&nbsp;meet the growing demand. To address this demand,&nbsp;UCLA librarians developed DResSUP (Digital Research&nbsp;Start Up Partnerships), a six-week summer program&nbsp;designed to create partnerships between library staff&nbsp;and researchers. At our institution, a core group of library staff have the expertise to engage with digital research projects beyond the initial phase of data discovery. Therefore DResSUP was initially built around this&nbsp;core group, allowing us to build a local community of&nbsp;practice and test our capacity for supporting digital&nbsp;projects. We have purposely kept the program small;&nbsp;working with a cohort of four to six graduate student&nbsp;“partners” each summer. Our strategy was, no doubt,&nbsp;also influenced by discussions of sustainability in the&nbsp;Digital Humanities community (see, for example,&nbsp;Maron and Pickle, 2014). What if we built a new program as though we were already in the sunset period?&nbsp;How could we minimize costs, maximize impact, build&nbsp;deep connections with researchers, respect ethical issues of graduate student labor, and facilitate engagement between library staff and researchers? We knew&nbsp;about minimal computing, but could we create a “minimal program” and still have an impact?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The goal of the program is to provide graduate students with skills and methods to continue the projects on their own. Rather than doing projects for them, we&nbsp;focus instead on teaching students to start with a small&nbsp;sample of their own dataset, working it through the research data lifecycle: collecting, cleaning, and analyz-ing/visualizing data, supplemented by a workshop on&nbsp;project management and the specific tools that are applicable to the students' research projects. In the second half of the program, we focus on the execution of&nbsp;their individual projects, building prototypes and adjusting workflows that allow them to complete their&nbsp;projects independently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After successfully offering this program for the past two years, we are expanding the program in ways that&nbsp;we hope will increase the library's capacity to support&nbsp;digital scholarship, which will make the program more&nbsp;sustainable over time and allow us to reach more researchers. Perhaps because we took a low-profile,&nbsp;grassroots approach, and because of general resistance to “reskilling” or “retooling” efforts, the most&nbsp;surprising response to DResSUP for us has been the&nbsp;enthusiasm and curiosity of our library colleagues. As&nbsp;they have learned more about the program, they have&nbsp;expressed interest in participating. However, at the&nbsp;same time, they raised legitimate concerns about their&nbsp;ability to support advanced digital research methods.&nbsp;Recognizing that they face a steep learning curve, one&nbsp;that will require additional resources to surmount, we&nbsp;have designed an expansion to the program, developing a second track for professional development for librarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Similar to Columbia University Library’s </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Developing Librarian</span><span class="font3"> and Indiana’s </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Research Now</span><span class="font3"> librarian training programs, we will take a project-based approach to professional development for librarians.&nbsp;But, rather than developing a separate program, librarians will participate in the extended DResSUP program, starting earlier in the year, gradually merging&nbsp;with the summer DResSUP graduate students. We will&nbsp;begin working with a small cohort of librarians in January 2017, who will follow the same curriculum as the&nbsp;graduate students. By Summer, the librarian cohort&nbsp;will have a plan for a collaborative digital research&nbsp;project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our short paper will begin by presenting DResSUP as it has functioned the past two years and our plans&nbsp;for the next three years, based on preliminary findings&nbsp;from this second librarian track of DResSUP which, by&nbsp;DH2017, will be well underway. We reason that by&nbsp;building capacity in our library community among&nbsp;permanent staff we can extend and grow DResSUP in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ways that are beneficial to both researchers and those responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that supports those endeavors. We will then&nbsp;discuss results from an open-ended questionnaire that&nbsp;we have designed to surface some of the issues around&nbsp;collaboration between librarians and digital humanities researchers (Siemens et al, 2011) and provide&nbsp;concrete suggestions for faculty, library administrators, and library staff members. Typically, the library's&nbsp;role in a digital project is negotiated when faculty are&nbsp;writing grant proposals and seek assistance with a required data management plan. We will argue that this&nbsp;strategy puts librarians at a disadvantage, having to&nbsp;function as gatekeepers in a bargaining process when&nbsp;researchers are hard pressed to stretch precious resources between their research goals and an institution's needs to cover the costs of supporting research&nbsp;functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, we will discuss the ways in which merging professional development for librarians with graduate&nbsp;students provides advantages by focusing library engagement efforts at an earlier stage, i.e., when graduate students begin research for their dissertations or&nbsp;when they begin working as research assistants. We&nbsp;will argue that graduate students function as vectors&nbsp;for spreading the message that librarians can provide&nbsp;valuable expertise: they teach undergraduate students, their peers, and their faculty. In this way, librarians can expand their impact, by focusing strategically&nbsp;on graduate students.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
