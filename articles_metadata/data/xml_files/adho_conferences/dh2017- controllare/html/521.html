<p><span class="font3">In most Western cultural contexts, the surgical modification of the female breast is usually presumed&nbsp;to take place in the context of cosmetic surgery primarily aimed at breast enhancement for the cis-gendered female. The cultural obsession with sexualizing breasts as a signifier of both heterosexuality and&nbsp;femininity has meant gender trouble for breast cancer&nbsp;patients (and BRCA “previvors”) seeking flat mastectomies, as well as transmasculine, genderqueer, and&nbsp;FTM individuals electing top surgeries. Whereas trans&nbsp;studies critiques have traced the emergence of (and&nbsp;subsequent resistance to) a prescriptive medical narrative authorizing gender affirming top surgeries, only&nbsp;recently have some in the breast cancer community&nbsp;begun to form identity groups around non-reconstructive surgical choices and an embrace of “flatness” on&nbsp;social media. This presentation is a comparative study&nbsp;of the reported experiences and rhetorical choices of&nbsp;social networks of two flat mastectomy groups: those&nbsp;pursuing mastectomy for reasons of gender affirmation, and those for whom mastectomy is primarily a&nbsp;treatment for cancer or cancer risk. The emergence of&nbsp;the Flattopper Pride movement within the breast cancer community represents a queering of conventional&nbsp;(female) breast reconstruction, offering feminist rhetoric that resists presumptions about the “natural” embodiment of femininity while occupying a position that&nbsp;is at once informed by transgender surgical narratives&nbsp;(and counter-narratives) yet articulates a distinctly&nbsp;different relationship to surgical modification of the&nbsp;female body. The circulation of mastectomy images&nbsp;through trans, queer fashion (Cat Walk &amp; Play Out underwear models), and e-patient breast cancer communities represents three distinct yet overlapping discursive contexts in which mastectomy derives cultural&nbsp;meaning. Through an exploration of how mastectomy&nbsp;images are circulated, censored, and shared in a variety of social media networks and support groups, feminist and queer critiques of surgical mastectomy options can be seen to emerge and create cross-influence&nbsp;between breast cancer, transgender, and genderqueer&nbsp;communities.</span></p>
