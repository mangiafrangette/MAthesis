<p><span class="font2">This paper discusses an exploratory project where a group of university academics, software developers,&nbsp;designers and librarians spent a week analysing a&nbsp;broad selection of the Wellcome Library's digital collections with an aim to explore new ways of conducting collaborative digital history research, identifying&nbsp;and documenting barriers and successes and also&nbsp;pointing to gaps in institutional support infrastructures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over the past two decades, significant quantities of cultural heritage have been digitised. Internet Archive&nbsp;has digitised over 20 million items in partnership with&nbsp;libraries and collections around the world. Google has&nbsp;digitised over 25 million books as Google Books.&nbsp;Alongside this the emergent field of digital humanities&nbsp;has sought to take advantage of new opportunities afforded by unprecedented access to collections. Numerous commentators and researchers have, in the&nbsp;words of Hayles (2015), voiced the opinion that “if&nbsp;there is an area of general agreement, it is the transformative potential of digital humanities for the humanities and for academic discourse” (see also Ogilvie,&nbsp;2016; Alves, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wellcome Library, part of the Wellcome Trust, is one of the world's most significant collections relating&nbsp;to health and medicine, with works ranging from posters and paintings to personal archives, printed books&nbsp;and packaging ephemera. Through its digitisation programmes, Wellcome is a major producer of digitised&nbsp;historical material and datasets, with over 40,000 digitised archives, nearly 100,000 digitised monographs&nbsp;and over 10,000 artworks, manuscripts, videos and reports. These have been made freely available under&nbsp;the most liberal licence possible, dependent on the&nbsp;copyright status of the material. In addition, IIIF image&nbsp;services (IIIF Consortium) including standardised image and presentation APIs, along with services for OCR&nbsp;and text search are provided (Chaplin, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A key aim for Wellcome is to enable new types of research and knowledge production; our mission is ‘to&nbsp;improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to&nbsp;thrive' (Wellcome Trust, 2016). One way we seek to do&nbsp;this is through enabling the exploration of cultural and&nbsp;social meanings of health in the past. Digitisation has&nbsp;undoubtedly increased use of our collections significantly and developed a large international audience,&nbsp;with over 50% of researchers accessing content from&nbsp;outside the UK. To better understand the users and usage of our digital collections we have carried out quantitative and qualitative research in collaboration with&nbsp;Prof. Pauline Leonard (Green and Andersen 2016).&nbsp;Our findings showed that beyond increasing access,&nbsp;the nature of collection usage has not changed significantly. The majority of researchers still access works&nbsp;within a single collection, page through digitised&nbsp;works in a linear fashion, make limited use of OCR&nbsp;search and little to no use of APIs. We are not yet seeing Hayle's “transformative potential” (2015) realised.&nbsp;To better understand this, we developed a number of&nbsp;hypotheses and research questions, which we categorise here under four loose umbrellas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lean working</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In summarising the findings of multiple digital historical studies, Alves has argued that they ‘implicitly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">confirm the efficiency of digital means... but also... that their application is, often, generally associated with&nbsp;expensive projects requiring extensive human resources with diverse skills' (2014). We questioned&nbsp;whether digital research is necessarily expensive or&nbsp;requiring of extensive resource. Drawing inspiration&nbsp;from commercial software development, we asked&nbsp;what is the Minimum Viable Product (Leanstack,&nbsp;2016); can teams achieve meaningful research relatively inexpensively through an agile approach of iterative investigation and identification of emergent areas of interest rather than pre-defining fixed research&nbsp;questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Skills and knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It could be argued that there is a skills or knowledge gap within traditional historical research&nbsp;communities which inhibits conducting digital research. However, we questioned if this was truly a barrier when evidence from citation patterns shows increases in collaborative approaches to digital humanities research (Nyhan and Williams, 2013). We questioned if extending the scope of traditional research&nbsp;teams to include commercial development partners&nbsp;could bring new insights and capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Crossing collections</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wellcome's digital collections include intensely heterogeneous material along with data sourced from&nbsp;multiple institutions. We questioned whether there&nbsp;are practical or technical barriers to break down divisions between collections and drawing from a range of&nbsp;content. Hitchcock (2013) has argued that ‘the lack of&nbsp;flexibility of the available digital tools [has] enabled&nbsp;only the effective utilization and analysis of quantitative sources or sources easily transformed into a quantitative format'. As many of Wellcome's collections are&nbsp;archival and contain large quantities of handwritten&nbsp;and pictorial material, we specifically wanted to explore the possibilities of digital for non-quantitative&nbsp;research, and research which still requires ‘close reading' of sources (Van Dijk, 1985).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Quality and consistency</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Areas of enquiry in this umbrella included whether our digital collection is suitable in its scale and scope,&nbsp;and the quality and consistency of OCR and collection&nbsp;metadata. We also questioned if we we had the right&nbsp;kind of web services available and their usability for&nbsp;individuals with different levels of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To explore and better understand these questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">we designed an experimental approach, adapting a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">concept becoming familiar to cultural institutions -the ‘hack day’ - and extending it out into a week-long intensive R&amp;D project, where small teams led by a mix&nbsp;of independent and academic researchers would work&nbsp;collaboratively to explore the Wellcome Library digital&nbsp;collections. Our participants included research staff&nbsp;from several UK universities, librarians and archivists,&nbsp;commercial designers and software developers.&nbsp;Through careful screening of participants, we selected&nbsp;researchers with shared enthusiasm for, but variable&nbsp;experience of digital historical research. This choice&nbsp;was deliberate in order to focus in on barriers relating&nbsp;to experience, skills and technical feasibility without&nbsp;confounding these variables with any reluctance to&nbsp;use digital methods. However, the enthusiasm for digital methods in the historical community is an important question and undoubtedly merits further investigation. Research areas were open-ended, with a&nbsp;focus on experimentation rather than production of&nbsp;finished work. However, we did agree broad areas, including handwritten records from a private asylum,&nbsp;5000 Medical Officer of Health reports covering London from 1848-1972, 6,600 issues of the trade journal&nbsp;Chemist and Druggist and the 79,000 books digitised&nbsp;by the UK-MHL project (Wellcome Library, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Drawing from approaches of participative and cooperative inquiry (Reason and Bradbury, 2008) we embedded Wellcome staff in mixed teams of academic&nbsp;staff, developers and designers, positioning the teams&nbsp;as researchers of the collections, participants in a&nbsp;broader experiment of research production and observers and documenters of the experiment itself. We&nbsp;encouraged self-documentation by teams through use&nbsp;of project boards, blogs and wikis, conducted individual interviews with participants throughout the process and held daily reviews and a plenary session to&nbsp;discuss progress and reflect on the experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the week we produced multiple tools and visualisations, and also historical findings. These are&nbsp;documented on the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">project blog</span><span class="font2">, along with the processes each team went through. This clearly demonstrated the potential of the collections, but also the&nbsp;barriers to working with them. Interestingly, the project using digitised archival material without OCR was&nbsp;one of the most successful - partly due to the synergy&nbsp;of the team members, but also the clarity of the challenge for the material. Two of the five projects seeded&nbsp;in the week continue to be developed, and we are continuing to provide support to the researchers leading&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Feedback from participants in the project identified particularly the benefits of working in teams with mixed skillsets. Developers and library staff gained&nbsp;from acquiring greater understanding of research processes and interests, while researchers gained access&nbsp;to technical skills, and exposure to a different approach to digital working. One participant remarked:&nbsp;‘I found working with other people, from a variety of&nbsp;different backgrounds, really generative - both for&nbsp;thinking about why people who do different kinds of&nbsp;work approach digital resources in different ways, and&nbsp;for thinking about my own research along new lines.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The web services we provide for programmatic access to digital collections were identified as a particular barrier during the week. While the images and bibliographic metadata for our collections are exposed through an international standard, the Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), this proved conceptually&nbsp;complex for developers to quickly prototype with, requiring combining and processing multiple JSON responses to access digital items. Adding further complexity to this, our collection OCR is available primarily&nbsp;through ALTO XML (Library of Congress, 2016) which&nbsp;our developers found challenging to process at scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As cultural heritage institution and a research funder, we are continuing to unpack the implications of the findings. As a library, we found great value in coproduction with research users so will be repeating a&nbsp;similar annual event, investigating different aspects of&nbsp;our collections. We have also identified particular issues related to the usability of our collections and&nbsp;added these to our development roadmap. As a funder&nbsp;we are considering options for increasing innovation&nbsp;by seeding early stage research through similar collaborative processes. To take this forward we will be running a series of pilot events through our interdisciplinary research residency, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">The Hub</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
