<p><span class="font2">This half-day tutorial introduces digital humanists at any level of experience to XQuery, a mature, high-level programming language used in many DH projects&nbsp;because it is purpose-built for analyzing, manipulating, and publishing data stored in the XML-based data&nbsp;formats that many DH projects use, e.g., TEI, EAD,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Led by two experts who each have a decade of experience using and teaching XQuery and who have coauthored </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">XQuery for Humanists</span><span class="font2"> (forthcoming, Texas A&amp;M University Press), this half-day tutorial introduces the key concepts underlying the XQuery language and the kinds of analysis that it makes possible.&nbsp;The focus will be on exploring TEI-encoded editions&nbsp;with simple XQuery expressions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Using a free and easy to install XQuery learning environment, participants (who must bring their own laptops) will gain hands-on experience writing queries&nbsp;against open datasets, including a TEI-encoded documentary edition, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Relations of the United States</span><span class="font2">.&nbsp;Participants will gain a basic foundation in the language and be introduced to community resources for&nbsp;further study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This half-day workshop will cover the basics of XQuery, providing participants with sufficient hands-on experience to start exploring their own scholarly&nbsp;editions and metadata with XQuery. We presuppose&nbsp;that participants will have come with a basic understanding of XML and TEI.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Students, scholars, and practitioners who use or are interested in using digital methods in their humanities work in academic departments, libraries, &quot;alt-ac&quot;&nbsp;fields, or their private capacity; no previous programming experience required; some experience XML or an&nbsp;XML-based format (TEI, EAD, MODS, METS) useful but&nbsp;not required. Participants will work with a common&nbsp;dataset provided by the tutorial leaders, but they may&nbsp;bring their own datasets for practice during the lab&nbsp;and consultation period.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tutorial leaders</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Clifford B. Anderson is Associate University Librarian for Research and Learning at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He has a M.Div. from Harvard&nbsp;Divinity School and a Th.M. and Ph.D. from Princeton&nbsp;Theological Seminary. He also holds a M.S. in Library&nbsp;and Information Science from the Pratt Institute in&nbsp;New York City. Cliff started working with XQuery in&nbsp;2006 before the first official version of the language&nbsp;was released. In 2014, he served as the project leader&nbsp;of the NEH-funded </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">XQuery Summer Institute</span><span class="font2"> at Vanderbilt University. He has also taught sessions on&nbsp;XQuery for iterations of Laura Mandel's </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Programming&nbsp;for Humanists</span><span class="font2"> course at Texas A&amp;M and leads the&nbsp;weekly </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">XQuery working group</span><span class="font2"> at Vanderbilt University for digital humanists</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Joseph C. Wicentowski is the Digital History Advisor in the Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University&nbsp;in modern East Asian history. He started using XQuery&nbsp;in 2007 to analyze and publish the Office of the Historian's </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">TEI-encoded publications and datasets</span><span class="font2">. For&nbsp;more on the project, see Wicentowski (2011). All code&nbsp;and data from the project are freely available on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">GitHub</span><span class="font2">. He recognized XQuery's potential to empower&nbsp;students, scholars, and practitioners to take control of&nbsp;their own data and build their own applications. But&nbsp;he knew that without resources geared toward people&nbsp;with a humanities background, others would struggle</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">as he first did. He began writing about XQuery in various digital humanities forums, contributing to the XQuery Wikibook online textbook, and giving workshops at the TEI@Oxford and Digital Humanities@Ox-ford Summer School programs. Joe regularly speaks&nbsp;and writes in the fields of history, documentary editing, and open government. He also actively participates in TEI, XQuery, and digital humanities communities, and fosters discussion about XQuery on Twitter at</span></p>
