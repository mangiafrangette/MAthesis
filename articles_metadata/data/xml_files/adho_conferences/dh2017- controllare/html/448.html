<p><span class="font2">Western University, Canada</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In Italian, il tavolo means ‘the table’, but la tavola, the feminine form, is ‘the sense of family felt around&nbsp;the dinner table’. My grandparents taught me the&nbsp;meaning of la tavola first-hand; they emigrated from&nbsp;Italy in 1959. Through my research, I document the&nbsp;Italian dialect of immigrants in Sarnia, Ontario,&nbsp;Canada. Through community collaboration, we work&nbsp;to preserve their stories.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Heritage languages are those brought by immigrants to a new place, and now spoken as a&nbsp;minority language by that community (Fishman,&nbsp;2001). There are two parts of this research: to record&nbsp;the histories of this community in their native Italian&nbsp;dialect; and second, to create a permanent and public&nbsp;digital archive to preserve this Heritage Language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The research question is: What is the best approach to create a community-university partnership that will&nbsp;benefit both the heritage and academic communities?&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From 1950-1969, at Halifax’s Pier 21, 20,00030,000 Italians arrived each year in search of a better life (pier21.ca). Today, 1.4 million Canadians identify&nbsp;with an Italian heritage (StatsCan, 2013). Almost all&nbsp;Canadians have a ‘hyphenated’ identity: Italian-,&nbsp;Dutch-, French-, etc. By collaborating with the&nbsp;university and heritage community to build a digital&nbsp;archive, I will establish an interdisciplinary means to&nbsp;preserve Heritage Languages and the histories of&nbsp;Heritage Communities throughout Canada.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Where?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">I have signed a two-year partnership with the Archives of Sarnia and Lambton County to create an&nbsp;online archive. Through this project, I digitized and&nbsp;uploaded hundreds of recordings, videos, images, and&nbsp;documents recently collected by myself, and by&nbsp;Caroline Di Cocco since the 1980s. Caroline is a local&nbsp;community historian who has contributed what she&nbsp;collected over the past 40 years. We will formally&nbsp;present the archive to Sarnia’s Italian community in&nbsp;June, 2017. This serves as a starting point showing the&nbsp;project’s feasibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have been given permission by Western University’s Libraries to host this archive,&nbsp;permanently, at the University. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Western Archive of&nbsp;Dialects and Languages</span><span class="font2"> (WADL) is available for other&nbsp;language projects, and my Italian research is the initial&nbsp;project to be hosted there (<a href="http://www.ir.lib.uwo.ca/wadl">www.ir.lib.uwo.ca/wadl</a>).&nbsp;Western University is only an hour from Sarnia, which&nbsp;allows me to remain an active member of Sarnia’s&nbsp;Italian community, and to keep the digital archive&nbsp;local.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">With the support of Western Libraries and Sarnia’s Italian community, the archive is being created&nbsp;through my coordination of the community and&nbsp;academia. Through my work with Lambton County&nbsp;Archives: I code the website; use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dublin Core&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">standards for metadata (Kunze et al., 1998); and&nbsp;digitize materials. I use Omeka software for the&nbsp;framework.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The archive is made up of many photographs, documents, and videos. I have collected and digitized&nbsp;just under 500 photographs so far. It is also made up&nbsp;of documents: digitized copies of boat tickets to cross&nbsp;to Canada, citizenship papers, letters, (delicious)&nbsp;recipes, and other ephemera of their Italian and&nbsp;Canadian experiences. I have just under 200&nbsp;documents so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am currently recording interviews with Ciociaria dialect speakers, using sociolinguistic techniques to&nbsp;collect life histories. I also have 47 interviews I’ve&nbsp;digitized that were conducted in the 1980s by Caroline&nbsp;di Cocco.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">WADL ensures that the community directly benefits from sharing their stories, materials, and time&nbsp;with the researcher. The information they share is&nbsp;returned in a permanent, secure, and digital way. This&nbsp;ensures that future generations will be able to access&nbsp;their heritage and history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The goal of this research is to show the importance of heritage—a significant part of the Canadian&nbsp;identity. My work will produce a collaborative&nbsp;partnership between Western University and Sarnia’s&nbsp;Italian community. This framework can be applied to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">preserve and promote other communities across Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In summary, the stories, culture, and language of this community cannot wait any longer to be recorded&nbsp;and digitized. There is an urgency as Sarnia’s original&nbsp;Italian community is reaching an advanced age. Now is&nbsp;the time to create an online presence: both for&nbsp;academics and for the public. There are research&nbsp;opportunities in this data, from a great number of&nbsp;disciplines. The community and broader public is&nbsp;interested in hearing these stories, seeing these&nbsp;photos, and cooking some of the recipes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I study how Sarnia’s Ciociaria pronounce “la tawola”, and ensure the survival of what they mean&nbsp;when they say it.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
