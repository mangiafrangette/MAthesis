<p><span class="font1">Research data play a fundamental role in science and the arts and humanities, a large part of them being&nbsp;either digitised or of digital provenance nowadays.&nbsp;Digital research data are fragile, which means that&nbsp;their thorough management and preservation is crucial to prevent the loss of data and information, avoid&nbsp;redundant data collection, enable more efficient research, ensure the verifiability and reproducibility of&nbsp;research results as well as the citability and re-usability of research data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The management and long-term preservation of digital research data requires an infrastructure that&nbsp;takes into account the digital nature and heterogeneity&nbsp;of the data and the diverse requirements of the research community. Research data centres, such as the&nbsp;Humanities Data Centre (HDC), are key players in this&nbsp;context. They provide a safe and trustworthy place for&nbsp;researchers to deposit their data as well as to search&nbsp;for and get access to previously deposited data. They&nbsp;also act as centres of expertise, offering training and&nbsp;support to their community. The importance of case-specific consultation must not be underestimated as&nbsp;the heterogeneity of digital research data and the wide&nbsp;range of data management tasks across the data life&nbsp;cycle call for extensive support by data experts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Comprising of a large number of disciplines and employing a variety of different research methods, the&nbsp;arts and humanities produce very heterogeneous research data. A great deal of them are file-based data,&nbsp;such as text, audio or video files. But there is an increasing number of more complex research data, such&nbsp;as digital editions or visualisation frameworks, that&nbsp;consist of various interwoven layers of different types&nbsp;of data. In these instances, it is often hard or impossible to distinguish between the “primary data” and the&nbsp;software application that is used to process and display the data. While there are more or less established&nbsp;solutions for file-based data (e.g. repositories), the curation and long-term preservation of complex data&nbsp;types still poses a challenge to infrastructure providers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of this background, the HDC developed an initial service portfolio in its design phase that responds to the heterogeneity and complexity of arts&nbsp;and humanities research data by offering consultation&nbsp;and training, repository services for file-based data&nbsp;and the application preservation. The latter is designed to sustain representations of complex research&nbsp;data such as digital editions or visualisation frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What are the challenges for the research data centre in this? Continuous access to static systems in a developing environment will create problems sooner or later - the systems will eventually become outdated&nbsp;and inaccessible. On the technological level, there are&nbsp;basically two concepts to preserve applications: either&nbsp;virtualisation or emulation of components. While&nbsp;emulation allows the operation of software (such as an&nbsp;operating system) on hardware and software environments it had not been developed for, it costs extra&nbsp;computing power to emulate the required environment, to name only one disadvantage. Virtualisation&nbsp;comes with the clear benefit that the hardware appears as a physical device to the system and to the software modules. The disadvantage is that the virtualised&nbsp;environment must be sufficiently performant directly&nbsp;on the hardware. But for most of the use cases considered here, only standard hardware is being used.&nbsp;Hence the advantage of running more than one virtualised system and the relatively simple management of&nbsp;these systems makes the virtualisation the state of the&nbsp;art approach. The poster illustrates how the application preservation of the HDC uses virtualisation to preserve complex research data applications in a protected environment and ensure their representation,&nbsp;citation and use for a finite period of time.</span></p>
