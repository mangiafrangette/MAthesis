<p><span class="font3">Residential segregation and socioeconomic inequality among neighborhoods is common in many American cities. Many large American cities became&nbsp;modern industrial urban places during the mid- to&nbsp;late-nineteenth century, so it is critical to understand&nbsp;the reality of human dimensions in cities during this&nbsp;period. Popular narratives tracing the history of the&nbsp;phenomenon back to that time have been constructed&nbsp;from analyses that used city wards or other large unit&nbsp;areas that aggregate data for many hundreds or even&nbsp;thousands of families. For example, prominent works</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">like </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Apartheid</span><span class="font3"> have concluded that black</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Americans were not particularly segregated from whites before 1900, and even then they were only&nbsp;slightly more separated from the native white population as the Irish and German immigrants (Massey and&nbsp;Denton 1993). By relying on aggregate datasets from&nbsp;the past, urban historians have been missing out on a&nbsp;level of granularity that would provide better measurements of segregation as well as critical context of&nbsp;spatial separation, given the relative smallness of&nbsp;American cities during their earlier years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mid-nineteenth century U.S. Census records contained an abundance of potential information relating to socioeconomic realities of each home during this&nbsp;key formative period in American history. The 1860&nbsp;and 1870 censuses were especially unique in that they&nbsp;collected each individual's personal estate value and&nbsp;real estate value (these economic variables were omitted from subsequent censuses). However, American&nbsp;census takers did not record address numbers of those&nbsp;they visited before 1880, which was after the Bureau&nbsp;of the Census stopped collecting these critical economic data about individuals and households. Furthermore, even if address data were available on manuscript census records for the time period, much of the&nbsp;built environment has changed since the mid nineteenth century, including the complete renaming of&nbsp;roads and - most importantly - the renumbering of&nbsp;houses along the street grid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rather than using easily-available aggregate data collected at city ward levels to make inferences about&nbsp;past urban geographies, this work has combined city&nbsp;directories and period advertisements with census&nbsp;records to reconstruct digitally the historical address&nbsp;systems of cities and geolocate every possible family&nbsp;in the 1860 census for the cities of Washington, D.C.,&nbsp;Nashville, Tennessee, and, for the 1870 census, the city&nbsp;of Omaha, Nebraska (additional cities will be added as&nbsp;the project expands). Notably, Donald DeBats and&nbsp;Mark Lethbridge had pioneered a similarly intensive&nbsp;approach for the much smaller cities of Newport, Kentucky and Alexandria, Virginia (DeBats and Lethbridge&nbsp;2005). Because of the extensive details collected by&nbsp;these censuses, these geolocated individuals provide&nbsp;rich new datasets for historical researchers to explore.&nbsp;By geolocating individuals, this research also highlights specific individual living situations and helps to&nbsp;complement known (and more easily accessible) anecdotal accounts from common primary sources such&nbsp;as journals and letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Placing Segregation</span><span class="font3"> is the primary result of this research effort - a new, open access digital project at the University of Iowa Libraries' Digital Scholarship and&nbsp;Publishing Studio that explores research questions&nbsp;about housing segregation and socioeconomic disparities across nineteenth century American cities&nbsp;through a series of fully interactive maps and scholarly&nbsp;interpretations derived from the geolocated census&nbsp;data. This presentation introduces core functionality&nbsp;of the digital exhibit and also explains in detail the process of developing the data and the website.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Built primarily upon Leaflet.js, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile friendly interactive maps, as well as other openly available JavaScript libraries&nbsp;such as Fuse.js, this digital map exhibit gives public audiences direct access to detailed census data for the&nbsp;years 1860 and 1870 in these select U.S. cities. A&nbsp;search feature allows visitors to quickly locate the historical residences of persons of interest and read complete census information about them, while a number&nbsp;of simple layer filters permit users to explore potentially infinite topics by giving them direct control over&nbsp;the geographic data. The primary digital exhibit gives&nbsp;audiences without GIS experience the power to ask research questions in a spatial environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Initial research findings from the project indicate that urban historians have been substantially&nbsp;underestimating the degree of housing segregation&nbsp;experienced by free black residents, even though some&nbsp;past research built on ward-level analyses closely&nbsp;approximated the extent of housing segregation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">between the native white population and various immigrant groups. The data generated for this project&nbsp;illustrate American cities were in fact significantly&nbsp;divided according to social class and wealth, long&nbsp;before the rise of the automobile. However, residents&nbsp;were less divided by wealth differences than they were&nbsp;separated spatially by skin color in Washington D.C. or&nbsp;by German and Irish origin in Nashville and Omaha.</span></p>
