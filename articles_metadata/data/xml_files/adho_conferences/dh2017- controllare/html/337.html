<p><span class="font4">The trail of destruction of cultural monuments in the Middle East in recent years has instigated or given&nbsp;renewed energy to concerns about threatened or&nbsp;destroyed cultural heritage and the use of technology&nbsp;in restoration and preservation. Beginning with work&nbsp;of Armin Grün and his colleagues on the Bamiyan&nbsp;Buddhas, crowd-sourcing of photographs and the use&nbsp;of photogrammetry to construct 3D representations&nbsp;has become an important method of enhancing&nbsp;existing archaeological data in preservation and&nbsp;reconstruction of cultural monuments that are at risk&nbsp;or have been destroyed. Current work of this kind&nbsp;includes - but is by no means limited to - the Rekrei&nbsp;initiative of Matthew Vincent and Chance Coughenour,&nbsp;and the Center for Cyber-Archaeology and&nbsp;Sustainability directed by Thomas Levy, based at&nbsp;University of California San Diego but established as a&nbsp;consortium also involving UCLA, UC Berkeley and UC&nbsp;Merced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The case of the Armenian cemetery at Julfa, near the ancient city of Jugha, is somewhat unique, because&nbsp;in the century prior to its final destruction access was&nbsp;very restricted, so archaeological research was not&nbsp;possible, and there are rather few - and certainly no&nbsp;'tourist' - photographs to draw on. At the beginning of&nbsp;last century, there were 10,000 tombstones in the&nbsp;cemetery, including a very large number of ornately&nbsp;carved cross stones ('khachkars') that are unique to&nbsp;Armenian culture. The cemetery was completely&nbsp;destroyed by Azeri troops in 2005-2006, and the site&nbsp;converted into a military shooting range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What we have as the basis for a reconstruction project are an archive of 2,000 photographs taken very&nbsp;systematically in the 1970s and 1980s by a&nbsp;remarkable Armenian scholar Argam Ayvanzyan,&nbsp;about 500 photographs taken on glass negatives in the&nbsp;early years of the 20th Century, and nearly 50&nbsp;tombstones that were removed from the cemetery&nbsp;over the course of the century, providing us with&nbsp;valuable direct evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this session, the three papers will present the challenges faced in a project of this scale and&nbsp;complexity, the methods adopted to meet them and&nbsp;the lessons learned to date, and will consider wider&nbsp;concerns about the role and potential of digital&nbsp;scholarship in the preservation of endangered cultural&nbsp;heritage and in addressing and confronting social&nbsp;injustice and cultural genocide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the first paper, Harold Short will give a brief overview of the project and its context, and will then&nbsp;focus on the wider cultural and political issues,&nbsp;relating its concerns to those of the many other&nbsp;current projects engaged in the reconstruction of&nbsp;cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the second, Judith Crispin will discuss the central role of images in the project, including the archive of&nbsp;photographs from the 20 th century and the significant&nbsp;number of film and digital photographs shot by the&nbsp;project, and the complex inter-relationship between&nbsp;images of different kinds in the creation of a&nbsp;comprehensive archive on the one hand and an&nbsp;immersive 3D installation on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the third paper, Drew Baker will focus on the issues faced by this and similar projects in creating&nbsp;and documenting the 3 D visualisations that are central&nbsp;to its long-term goals. This includes making it possible&nbsp;for individual monuments to be viewed as ‘naturally’&nbsp;and in as much detail as possible, but also enabling&nbsp;shared group experiences - of the kind that would be&nbsp;possible in a ‘real’ cemetery.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Role of Digital Humanities in Countering Cultural Genocide: the virtual reconstruction&nbsp;of Julfa Cemetery</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harold Short</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The roots of Armenian culture can be traced to the establishment of Nakhichevan during the Fourth&nbsp;Century BC in what is now the Nakhchivan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Autonomous Republic, an exclave of Azerbaijan. Nakhichevan’s name derives from the Armenian&nbsp;“Nakhnakan Ichevan&quot; (landing place), referring to the&nbsp;place Noah landed his Ark after the biblical deluge. It&nbsp;was in Nakichevan that Mesrob Mashtots first created&nbsp;the Armenian Alphabet and opened early Armenian&nbsp;schools. The centre of Nakichevan’s culture was the&nbsp;ancient city of Julfa (or Jugha), destroyed by order of&nbsp;Shah Abbas in 1605 during one of the periodic wars&nbsp;between Persia and Turkey. The Shah’s scorched earth&nbsp;policy did not require the destruction of the cemetery,&nbsp;so it survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Until 2005, Julfa cemetery graced the banks of the river Arax with 10,000 tombstones and other funerary&nbsp;monuments, including over 2,000 ornate Armenian&nbsp;khachkars (cross-stones) from the 15th and 16th&nbsp;century, inscribed with Christian crosses, suns,&nbsp;flowers and climbing plants. Alongside Julfa’s&nbsp;khachkars stood heavily inscribed ram-shaped stones,&nbsp;unique to this cemetery, and ordinary tombstones.&nbsp;Spread over three hills on Nakhichevan’s border with&nbsp;Iran, Julfa cemetery was home to the largest (and&nbsp;probably the earliest) collection of Eastern Christian&nbsp;cultural monuments in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 2005 Azerbaijani authorities demolished Julfa cemetery’s priceless khachkars with bulldozers,&nbsp;loaded the crushed fragments onto trucks and&nbsp;emptied them into the river Arax. Shortly thereafter,&nbsp;Nakhichevan authorities constructed a military&nbsp;shooting range on the very ground where thousands&nbsp;of human remains lie, now unmarked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 2013 a small research team was established, seeking to ascertain whether sufficient primary&nbsp;sources still existed to make possible a large scale&nbsp;digital recreation of Julfa cemetery. The results were&nbsp;published in the ebook “Recovering a Lost Armenian&nbsp;Cemetery”, which can be downloaded from the project&nbsp;webpage at (<a href="https://julfaproject.wordpress.com/">https://julfaproject.wordpress.com/</a>).&nbsp;Based on this work, the Julfa Cemetery Digital&nbsp;Repatriation Project was launched in 2015. It aims to&nbsp;return to the Armenian people the entire medieval&nbsp;section of Julfa’s cemetery, consisting of 2,000&nbsp;khachkars and ram-shaped stones. These destroyed&nbsp;monuments are now designated by UNESCO as&nbsp;‘intangible world heritage’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In further field work in 2015 and 2016, in Armenia, Iran and Georgia, the project team took over 50,000&nbsp;high resolution digital photographs and 3D scans of&nbsp;the extant tombstones - i.e. those removed from the&nbsp;cemetery during the 20th Century. These were used&nbsp;to create an initial immersive 3D exhibition, which was&nbsp;shown for the first time in Rome in September 2016.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further shows are planned in Australia and North America by the time of the DH2017 conference, with&nbsp;additional khachkars added as the work on the&nbsp;photographic archive proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Julfa Cemetery Digital Repatriation Project is hosted by Australian Catholic University at its North&nbsp;Sydney campus, and is a project of the Institute for&nbsp;Religion and Critical Inquiry. The purpose of the&nbsp;project is to create a virtual reconstruction of the&nbsp;cemetery, with the aims of ensuring the public&nbsp;memory of Armenia’s cultural heritage, not only for&nbsp;the benefit of Armenians but also as an important&nbsp;contribution to world cultural heritage. The project&nbsp;will also restore a measure of dignity to the 10,000&nbsp;deceased inhabitants, whose graves now lie unmarked&nbsp;beneath a shooting range. The project will also&nbsp;safeguard an important testimony to early Christian&nbsp;history in the Near East, and to Armenian-Persian and&nbsp;Christian-Islamic relations over a period of centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The project’s primary goals are six-fold:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">to create an extensive archive of materials&nbsp;related to the cemetery and its monuments-photographs, documents and digital&nbsp;materials, to be housed at Australian&nbsp;Catholic University and the State Library of&nbsp;New South Wales in Sydney;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">to carry out research and create a basis for&nbsp;ongoing research, not only in Armenian&nbsp;history, religion and culture, but in the&nbsp;history and culture of the wider region,&nbsp;including Persia/Iran;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">to create permanent virtual reality&nbsp;installations in Yerevan and Sydney (and any&nbsp;other city that wishes to have one);</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">to create a touring exhibition that can travel&nbsp;to cities without the resources to establish a&nbsp;permanent installation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">to create a vivid web presence, including&nbsp;online virtual reality exhibits, open to&nbsp;comment and contribution to everyone who&nbsp;may be interested;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">to work in collaboration with other projects&nbsp;and individuals interested in the&nbsp;preservation and reconstruction of&nbsp;destroyed and endangered cultural heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main source materials are over 2,500 original photographs of the site dating from 1915 until the&nbsp;present, illustrated manuscripts, handwritten&nbsp;journals, architectural sketches and audio recordings.&nbsp;The installations and other outputs will be derived&nbsp;from the repository of research materials gathered&nbsp;and created by the project—archaeological, historical,&nbsp;cultural, theological.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One distinguishing feature of the project is that in addition to ambitious 3D visualisations and&nbsp;realisations, research is being carried out on the&nbsp;carvings and inscriptions. The symbolism of the&nbsp;carvings is important in Armenian theology and&nbsp;cultural history. In addition, each khachkar was&nbsp;created for an individual (or occasionally an event),&nbsp;and the project is researching the inscriptions in order&nbsp;to identify as many as possible of the individuals (and&nbsp;events) they commemorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reconstruction of the cemetery is of particular importance to Armenians, who see its destruction as&nbsp;part of a pattern of cultural genocide in the Near East,&nbsp;and the project has received considerable support&nbsp;from Armenians not only in the country but in the&nbsp;many diaspora communities around the world,&nbsp;including Sydney. There is much wider significance,&nbsp;however. The cemetery was on the border between&nbsp;Armenia and Persia, and the photographic record&nbsp;demonstrates considerable Persian / Muslim&nbsp;influences in the design and carving of the stones. The&nbsp;history of the cemetery is important, therefore, as&nbsp;Iranian as well as Armenian history. In addition there&nbsp;is the wider consideration that all cultural heritage is&nbsp;world heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Note: a key reason for the project being based at the Australian Catholic University in Sydney, Australia&nbsp;is that the Armenian diaspora in that city numbers&nbsp;45,000, with many of the families living there able to&nbsp;trace their ancestry back to the Armenians forced by&nbsp;Shah Abbas to leave the ancient city of Julfa prior to its&nbsp;destruction, and to travel with his army to the city of&nbsp;New Julfa, which he constructed near his capital,&nbsp;Isfahan.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the key challenges the project is facing is to do with the ‘politics’ of cultural memory. Whose&nbsp;interpretation of Armenian - or Iranian - cultural&nbsp;history should be represented? How can differing&nbsp;perspectives on the symbolism of the carvings be&nbsp;reflected? Engagement with a global ‘audience’ is a&nbsp;key commitment of the project, but how can such&nbsp;engagement be managed in a practical manner that&nbsp;respects the viewpoints and ‘rights’ of all who wish to&nbsp;contribute?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The political dimensions of repatriating conflict-destroyed sites and the ‘human rights’ aspects of the project are among some broader questions around the&nbsp;role of digital humanities scholarship in addressing&nbsp;cultural genocide and social injustice. How explicit&nbsp;should such motivations be, especially given that&nbsp;questions of cultural genocide are always contested?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Related to these questions, the paper will also consider how the Julfa Cemetery project stands in the&nbsp;landscape of the many other projects now at work on&nbsp;the reconstruction of threatened or destroyed cultural&nbsp;heritage, and the opportunities for collaboration, not&nbsp;only in relation to technical methods, but perhaps&nbsp;even more importantly in relation to the social,&nbsp;political and regional issues that are common to them&nbsp;all.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Image-memory and Julfa Cemetery Digital Repatriation Project.</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Judith Crispin</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">From its very inception the work of the Julfa Cemetery Digital Repatriation Project has been&nbsp;centred around the image. The once great cemetery&nbsp;that graced the banks of the river Arax exists now only&nbsp;in memory, anecdote and across a slim collection of&nbsp;photographic records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1648, when French missionary and lexicographer Alexandre de Rhodes visited Julfa&nbsp;cemetery, he reported seeing at least 10,000&nbsp;,khachkars (Armenian cross-stones) in good condition&nbsp;at the site. By the early 20 th century this number had&nbsp;declined to only 6000 monuments, including the&nbsp;cemetery’s ram-shaped stones. The construction of a&nbsp;railway through Julfa cemetery by Soviet forces in the&nbsp;early 20th century saw the destruction of many&nbsp;monuments, some being repurposed as construction&nbsp;materials. In the 1970s the cemetery was repeatedly&nbsp;visited, over a number of years, by the Armenian&nbsp;researcher Argam Ayvazyan. He meticulously&nbsp;recorded the number of existing khachkars at that&nbsp;time to be 462, spread over the first hill, 1,672 across&nbsp;the second, and 573 on the third. Over 1,000 ramshaped stones and tombstones stood at the site and&nbsp;more than 1,400 additional monuments, khachkars&nbsp;and ram-shaped stones still existed but in fragments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1998, Azeri soldiers toppled and removed 800 khachkars from the cemetery and began destroying&nbsp;others with bulldozers. This process, temporarily&nbsp;blocked by protests from UNESCO, was resumed in&nbsp;November 2002 when all the remaining khachkars&nbsp;were toppled. Between 10 and 14 December 2005, the&nbsp;distressed Armenian Bishop of Tabriz video-recorded&nbsp;100 soldiers pulverising Julfa’s khachkars with heavy&nbsp;hammers and pick axes. Broken fragments were&nbsp;shovelled on to lorries and dumped in the river Arax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 2006 an international parliamentary delegation representing Switzerland, France, Greece, Canada, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">United Kingdom, Belgium and Scotland urged UNESCO to condemn, in no uncertain terms, the destruction of&nbsp;cultural sites at Julfa, including its cemetery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fortunately, during the course of last century, a number of monuments were removed from Julfa&nbsp;cemetery for a variety of reasons, including over 25&nbsp;khachkars and a similar number of ram-shaped stones&nbsp;and ordinary tombstones. These are invaluable in&nbsp;providing the only remaining direct evidence of the&nbsp;monuments of Julfa cemetery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three field trips were undertaken by the project, in 2013, 2015 and 2016, to identify and gather as much&nbsp;primary material as possible, and to take a large&nbsp;number of additional photographs - film and digital -of extant monuments and locations. (The trips were&nbsp;financially supported by the Australian Catholic&nbsp;University, Gulbenkian Foundation, and organisations&nbsp;and individuals from the Armenian diaspora in&nbsp;Australia.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Khachkars are unique to Armenian culture, and most are ornately and intricately carved. Each was&nbsp;carved to commemorate a particular individual (or&nbsp;occasionally an event) and no two khachkars are the&nbsp;same. For the most part the carvings employ common&nbsp;iconographic symbols, and many contain inscriptions.&nbsp;The details of the carvings are therefore extremely&nbsp;important in understanding any given khachkar, and&nbsp;this is one of the many challenges facing the project -faithful restoration of each individual monument, with&nbsp;all the detailed intricacy of its carving, and at the same&nbsp;time placing each in correct relationship to its&nbsp;neighbours, and within a reconstructed environment&nbsp;that is as faithful as possible to the original cemetery&nbsp;both visually and aurally (by means of 3D sound&nbsp;recordings).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Using the materials gathered on the field trips the project has piloted a number of new methods to try to&nbsp;reconstruct the total cemetery scene. Despite the Julfa&nbsp;cemetery site being under military control since the&nbsp;early 1900s, and part of an active conflict zone at&nbsp;present, we have nevertheless found ways to obtain&nbsp;high-resolution photographs of the entire region. As a&nbsp;result of our fieldwork, we have now accumulated an&nbsp;extensive archive of materials from which to generate&nbsp;VR (virtual reality) representations of the medieval&nbsp;Armenian cemetery at Julfa. These materials include&nbsp;photographs and 3D scans of extant khachkars, ramshaped stones, tombstones and other monuments;&nbsp;historical photographs (and negatives) taken of Julfa&nbsp;cemetery prior to its destruction in 2006;&nbsp;architectural drawings of extant stones; maps;&nbsp;satellite images; audio field recordings; video field&nbsp;recordings; books &amp; manuscripts. We have also sought&nbsp;to engage the Armenian community, both within&nbsp;Armenia and also in the diaspora, at every stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An over-riding goal of the project is to create secondary models that convey some of the beauty and&nbsp;gravitas of this important site, and its remarkable&nbsp;monuments. But a great deal of image work must be&nbsp;undertaken before any new models can emerge. Old&nbsp;photographic negatives and positives must be&nbsp;restored, preserved, catalogued and documented. New&nbsp;high-resolution images must be created of all&nbsp;surviving artifacts and brought into the service of&nbsp;model-creating practice. Both film and digital&nbsp;photographs have been shot, some to fulfil an archive&nbsp;purpose, and others to support the detailed and&nbsp;complex photogrammetry techniques needed to&nbsp;convert 2D images into 3D models. Experience has&nbsp;shown that even with 3D scans, there is still a need for&nbsp;these to be supplemented by photogrammetry using&nbsp;the archival photographs in an intricate iterative&nbsp;process if an acceptable 3D model is to be created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The collection, curation and secondary manipulation of images open a number of serious&nbsp;questions about best practice including issues of data&nbsp;transparency and the degradation of the digital image.&nbsp;This session will trace the evolution of old and new&nbsp;images from their origins in film or file to their final&nbsp;destination as components in a large scale digital&nbsp;realization of Julfa’s lost cemetery. It will examine the&nbsp;balance of scholarship and creative practice that has&nbsp;emerged from our efforts to date. We will discuss the&nbsp;relationship of our project with other cultural&nbsp;stakeholders including museums, galleries and trusts&nbsp;as well as the channels of communication we have&nbsp;established with the Armenian people and their&nbsp;representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the spirit of collegiality, we will examine the aspects of image curation and manipulation that have&nbsp;failed as well as those that have succeeded. We will&nbsp;also discuss some of the political and social pitfalls that&nbsp;await the unwary researcher. Over the past decade so&nbsp;many important world sites have been lost to conflict&nbsp;and it is the aim of this project to facilitate other&nbsp;projects that seek to digitally return these treasures to&nbsp;the international community. The humanities, as&nbsp;range of academic disciplines and practice, have a very&nbsp;great challenge to answer in the form of decimated&nbsp;cultural monuments and the large-scale destruction of&nbsp;primary historical records. This challenge is also an&nbsp;opportunity for the humanities to occupy a more vital&nbsp;and relevant role in global scholarship than it has in&nbsp;previous times.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Modelling a Cemetery - and not just its monuments</span></h1><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Drew Baker</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work undertaken through the Julfa Cemetery Digital Repatriation Project presents a wide range of&nbsp;challenges at all levels from data acquisition,&nbsp;digitalisation, documentation and visualisation. The&nbsp;latter of these, irrespective of any project that includes&nbsp;computer-based visualisation of cultural heritage, is&nbsp;by its nature complex, seeking - as it must - an&nbsp;appropriate balance between meaningful scholarly&nbsp;representation and a simulated environment that&nbsp;extends our understanding beyond a simple digital&nbsp;ekphrasis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While aspects of the creation of content undertaken as part of the project will be familiar to&nbsp;those working in the field of virtual archaeology the&nbsp;Julfa Project has a unique set of constraints that impact&nbsp;on the acquisition of data, traditional recording&nbsp;processes and output/dissemination approaches. The&nbsp;sensitivities surrounding the Julfa cemetery site and&nbsp;its more recent history are manifold; political, cultural,&nbsp;theological, socio-religious and, critically, on going,&nbsp;while the absence of hard archaeological remains and&nbsp;restrictions on recording both extant monuments and&nbsp;context further complicate established approaches&nbsp;even to contested archaeology and cultural history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the cemetery is to be fully understood - and experienced - it has to be seen as more than the sum&nbsp;of its monuments. The character of the cemetery as a&nbsp;whole depended not only on its monuments, but on its&nbsp;topography, its natural and built environment -including the nearby river Arax, and the plant, insect&nbsp;and bird life - and the people who lived around it and&nbsp;who worked in and near it, the families who once came&nbsp;to visit the graves of their relatives, the priests who&nbsp;officiated at burials and other rituals there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So the wider context of the cemetery, that is to say the surrounding landscape of the Arax River valley, is&nbsp;integral to understanding the location of Julfa&nbsp;cemetery and the placement of the monuments it&nbsp;contained. The river, however, forms a sensitive&nbsp;border between Iran, Armenia and the Nakhchivan&nbsp;Autonomous Republic exclave of Azerbaijan where the&nbsp;cemetery site is located. The comprehensive&nbsp;destruction of the cemetery and its monuments to&nbsp;make way for a military installation further&nbsp;compounds issues of context, with the finer&nbsp;topographical details of the immediate cemetery area&nbsp;at best inaccessible and at worst destroyed or covered&nbsp;in concrete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dichotomy here is one of granularity. The wider landscape context is instantly recognisable but&nbsp;the detail in which to place the monuments within is&nbsp;lacking, and both are necessary if the placement of the&nbsp;reconstructed monuments is to be faithful to the&nbsp;evidence within the archive. Satellite imagery, maps&nbsp;and photographic imagery from both the archive and&nbsp;fieldwork have had to be bought together and&nbsp;harmonized in order to provide a level of detail that is&nbsp;both recognizable as the Julfa region but also practical&nbsp;in terms of providing a virtual space to place&nbsp;monuments that is workable within the technological&nbsp;constraints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Similar challenges are presented with the monuments themselves. Out of the some two thousand&nbsp;khachkars the work undertaken in the preliminary&nbsp;stages of the project has focused on around thirty that&nbsp;were removed before 2005. Because the existence of&nbsp;these artefacts represents fundamental evidence in&nbsp;the disputed history of the cemetery the monuments&nbsp;removed from the medieval cemetery at Julfa are&nbsp;themselves considered ‘at risk’ and fieldwork has had&nbsp;to be conducted with a degree of discretion that&nbsp;prohibits certain methods of data acquisition. Indeed&nbsp;even where official permission was required and&nbsp;granted operations in the field attracted unwanted&nbsp;attention from passers-by that went beyond the&nbsp;familiar casual interest that field work naturally&nbsp;attracts ranging from concern to non-physical&nbsp;confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each document from the extant monument recording process has required combining, cleaning&nbsp;and in some instances repairing in order to create a&nbsp;faithful digital representation of the target monument.&nbsp;Further these have had to be considered in the context&nbsp;of placement within the virtual world and strategies&nbsp;and techniques have been implemented to deal with&nbsp;multimillion polygon scans so as not to prejudice the&nbsp;performance specification of the interactive&nbsp;deliverables. Equally where the monuments are no&nbsp;longer extant, or in a few cases where data acquisition&nbsp;has been impossible, but are present in the archival&nbsp;record these have been recreated based on primary&nbsp;resources and then harmonised with other digital&nbsp;assets to provide a comprehensive spatial&nbsp;environment in which the cemetery can be explored&nbsp;and understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within the created digital world of the Julfa project each significant element, landscape, monument,&nbsp;building, therefore has a pedigree of metadata and&nbsp;paradata that can be assessed and verified. This audit&nbsp;trail not only allows the scholar to drill down into the&nbsp;project archive to access specific information about a&nbsp;particular monument and its interrelations - in effect&nbsp;creating a visual and spatial index to the corpus - but&nbsp;is essential if the visual outcomes of the project are to&nbsp;be both a faithful and accurate representation of the&nbsp;evidence and robust enough to with stand scrutiny&nbsp;and the inevitable criticism that a project of this nature&nbsp;will attract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the applications of computer graphics to cultural history has a strong pedigree within the&nbsp;Digital Humanities, rapidly changing hardware,&nbsp;software and methods have led to a constantly&nbsp;changing landscape of possibilities for visualisation as&nbsp;a research tool. Conversely this potential has also&nbsp;created a gulf of expectation between the scholar,&nbsp;developer and consumer that increasingly requires a&nbsp;much broader and diverse skill set traditionally&nbsp;associated with a visual digital outcome. The design of&nbsp;the production workflow has therefore incorporated&nbsp;and engaged with techniques and practices from&nbsp;theatre, photography, film making, video game&nbsp;production, acoustic engineering, audio visual design&nbsp;to achieve a synthesis of best practice across a wide&nbsp;spectrum of interdisciplinary approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moreover the increased visual literacy through exposure to mainstream media on the part of the end&nbsp;consumer has led to a presumption that any output&nbsp;derived from scholarly research but expressed&nbsp;through computer graphics will have the same&nbsp;character as mass media outputs experienced at the&nbsp;cinema, television and video game console.&nbsp;Understanding the tension between these expectation&nbsp;and presumptions at all stages of the development&nbsp;cycle is now more crucial than ever if projects of this&nbsp;nature are to succeed. New modes of engagement&nbsp;must be developed, revived or co-opted from other&nbsp;disciplines and added to the collection of tools&nbsp;available to the project allowing different modes of&nbsp;engagement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These considerations have informed the shape of the dissemination media formats that have been&nbsp;developed. Recognition of the cemetery as a place that&nbsp;is greater than the sum of its monuments has led to a&nbsp;primary focus on creating a communal immersive&nbsp;experience, so as to allow emotional engagement with&nbsp;the ‘whole’ lost cultural heritage of Julfa cemetery. At&nbsp;the same time, the importance of the monuments&nbsp;themselves must not be forgotten, so a second focus&nbsp;has been on displays that allow individual monuments&nbsp;to be viewed and interrogated at close quarters, and at&nbsp;full size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The session will consider the challenges presented in both the creation and dissemination strategies&nbsp;available to a multi-faceted project with diverse&nbsp;stakeholders as manifested in our project. This will&nbsp;include a review of current best practice within&nbsp;cultural heritage visualisation and ‘lessons learnt’&nbsp;from the project’s colloquium and demonstrations in&nbsp;Rome in September 2016, and in subsequent&nbsp;demonstrations.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
