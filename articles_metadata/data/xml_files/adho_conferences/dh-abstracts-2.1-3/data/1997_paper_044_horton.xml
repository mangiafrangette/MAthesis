                    <head>The background</head>
                    <p>The concept of community in an online context is a relatively recent
                        phenomenon, and deals with social groupings formed through the shared medium
                        of computer mediated communication (CMC). In addition, the civic metaphor
                        (for instance, the 'virtual community') is coming to replace the information
                        superhighway as the dominant metaphor for understanding and constructing
                        cyberspace. As a concept centrally related to the civic metaphor, it is
                        therefore important to understand what we mean by 'virtual community', a
                        expression much used in varying contexts to encompass disparate social
                        groupings. There is, consequently, a need to identify the constituent
                        features that differentiate between genuine online community (which, we
                        argue, involves networks of personal relationships) and other social
                        aggregations.</p>
                    <p>Recent research into cultural formations in cyberspace proposes different
                        ways of identifying virtual community and considers the similarities and
                        differences between virtual (online) community and embodied 'real space'
                        community. For instance, Bruckman (1992) considers that technological
                        features of the virtual environment combine with self-selected membership to
                        create a community with a strong shared sense of values. She also argues
                        that shared activity reinforces community, a theme which is developed in her
                        later work on her created professional community environment, MediaMOO
                        (Bruckman and Resnick, 1995). Reid (1994) has studied interaction on MUDs
                        and MOOs, which are text-based virtual reality systems. She identifies users
                        of these systems as a distinct cultural group which is characterized by
                        their use of novel methods of textualizing non-verbal communication. Again,
                        she considers that the group has its own distinct systems of meaning. A
                        central issue for Reid is an examination of forms of social and
                        technological control which are employed to regulate interaction and
                        penalize or exclude disruptive influences. Smith (1992) evaluates virtual
                        community in terms of its capacity to create collective goods in the form of
                        the provision of social networks, the production of 'knowledge capital' and
                        communion; this last term is understood as a sense of membership, which is
                        fostered by personal and emotional communication. Smith is also concerned
                        with mechanisms of control which can be used to overcome obstacles to
                        community formation and deal with violations of community standards.
                        Rheingold (1995) has proposed a definition of virtual communities, "social
                        aggregations that emerge from the Net when enough people carry on those
                        public discussions long enough, <emph rend="italics">with sufficient human
                            feeling</emph>, [emphasis added] to form webs of personal relationships
                        in cyberspace." Both this prerequisite of communicated, human feeling, and
                        the concept of a shared system of meanings and/or values, are key factors in
                        identifying the existence of virtual community as opposed to any other sort
                        of group or aggregation.</p>
                    <p>The researchers mentioned above have, in general, taken an ethnographic and
                        qualitative approach to the communities and cultural formations under study.
                        As language is <emph rend="italics">the</emph> medium of computer-mediated
                        communication, we argue that empirical linguistic analysis should be both an
                        alternative and fruitful way to understand the emergence and structure of a
                        virtual community. A 'speech community' can potentially be identified by
                        linguistic convergence at a lexical and/or structural level. Because
                        Computer Mediated communication, as we suggest, is strongly oral in nature
                        (December, 1993) (Ferrara et al., 1991), we believe that speech
                        accommodation theory (Giles and Powesland, 1975) is an appropriate model by
                        which to explain the acquisition of shared meanings, being the first of the
                        two hypothesized major elements of virtual community.</p>

                    <head>The practical study</head>
                    <p>The corpus studied consists of eight months' postings to one electronic
                        discussion list consisting of 2,600 messages. Messages are gathered,
                        organized and mailed daily to members of the list. The discussion list is
                        composed of people who have little else in common except for the fact that
                        they listen to a certain radio programme in New York City, or obtain tapes
                        of the show if they reside elsewhere. The show they listen to is Vin
                        Scelsa's "Idiots Delight," and the name of the mailing list is the Idiots
                        Delight Digest (IDD). Participants to the mailing list reside in most areas
                        of the United States, including at least a half-dozen countries outside
                        North America, although most are concentrated in the New York-Northern New
                        Jersey region. We gathered postings from the very first issue of the digest,
                        through to when they organized their first face-to-face barbeque. Until the
                        time of the barbeque, most members would not recognize each other on the
                        street. The members explicitly decided that they would not limit their
                        contributions to Vin Scelsa, Idiots Delight, music, or any other topic. As
                        one member posted, "This is a virtual barbeque, and we should talk about
                        anything that's on our minds. That's what a barbeque is there for."
                        Consequently, some postings contain very personal messages, like news of the
                        death of a relative, marital breakdowns, the loss of employment, alcoholism
                        and wife abuse.</p>
                    <p>The corpus has been pre-processed and analysed using everyday off-the-shelf
                        tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel, to determine the profile and core
                        membership of the hypothesized community. An important aim of this work has
                        been to develop a methodology that could be applied to other corpora, using
                        computing tools which are commonly available and quickly learned by a
                        researcher without a computing background.</p>
                    <p>The methodology is strongly influenced by Stubbs's (1996) approach to corpus
                        analysis in the British, neo-Firthian tradition. Stubbs proposes a model of
                        meaning which is situated in the relationship between text, writer and
                        reader; meaning is analysed distributionally on the basis of observed,
                        objective textual evidence. Specifically, to paraphrase Firth, the meaning
                        of a word can be deduced from the company it keeps--not only is meaning
                        conveyed directly, but also indirectly through patterns of co-occurrence of
                        words. These lexical collocates are not easily observable except through
                        computer-assisted corpus analysis. Stubbs shows how corpus evidence such as
                        the patterns of usage of keywords/focal words (Williams, 1976) (Firth, 1935)
                        help to explain a linguistic structure that transmits and reinforces
                        culture.</p>
                    <p>We are using TACT, the concordance program, to carry out a surface linguistic
                        analysis of the corpus seeking evidence that tests the definition of a
                        virtual community as a social aggregation in cyberspace which possesses a
                        flexible but characteristic set of shared meanings, located in the speech
                        community in the form of a consensus interpretation, and that meanings
                        within the community differ significantly from the equivalent meaning
                        possessed by the wider culture in which the virtual community is embedded.
                        Further, members of that community communicate with a sufficient degree of
                        human feeling to create and maintain a sense of communion and shared
                        presence. In addition, mechanisms of control, including sanctions, are used
                        to regulate social interaction and shared social activities. These sanctions
                        indicate shared normative behavior.</p>
                    <p>The form of evidence we seek are patterns of usage and collocations of
                        selected keywords in context which can be used to identify the hypothesized
                        community traits. These keywords are to be initially derived as follows:<list>
                            <item>1. <emph rend="bold">Shared meaning</emph>: Stubbs (1996:157ff)
                                discusses keywords which have been used in various studies to
                                identify, by their usage, elements of transmitted culture. These
                                keywords and their collocates are examined in context to find out
                                whether patterns of usage differ significantly from the wider
                                cultural usage, thus perhaps indicating the development of a
                                characteristic community consensus meaning. Other potential keywords
                                are identified by manual inspection of the corpus.</item>
                            <item>2. <emph rend="bold">Human feeling</emph>: an initial keyword-list
                                of personal/emotional words has been drawn up, and further relevant
                                keywords will be added from both examination of tables of collocates
                                of the initial keywords, and manual inspection of the corpus</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Other features we examine include evidence of lexical convergence; the
                        handling of conflict and the building of a group topic consensus; and the
                        influence of individual members' language on the group's language. related

                    <head>Further analysis.</head>
                    <p>We are currently conducting a linguistic analysis on the corpus, and we will
                        report to the meeting our findings about community formation, and in
                        particular the findings, will be compared with the work of Smith, Reid and
                        Bruckman. A contra-indication of community formation will also be discussed:
                        the formation of what Beniger (1987) calls a <emph rend="italics"
                            >pseudo-community</emph> which occurs when mass media is personalized
                        such that the recipient believes that a communication is meant for
                        themselves alone when in fact it is aimed at a much larger set of
                        recipients.</p>
                    <p>Our preliminary investigation indicates that Stubbs's methodology is useful
                        in discovering and measuring the emergence and growth of a virtual
                        community. The number and extent of shared meanings appears to grow over
                        time, and the emotional cohesion of the group has increased, as well. We
                        also believe that our configuration of off-the-shelf tools, available to
                        most people involved with humanities computing, will be both relevant and
                        useful.</p>
