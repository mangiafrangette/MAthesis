                    <head>1. Introduction</head>
                    <p>In many areas of computing, benchmarking is a routine practice. There is
                        insufficient room here to go into the pros and cons of benchmarking in any
                        depth, except to acknowledge that sets of benchmarks do have drawbacks as
                        well as advantages. Nevertheless benchmarking does have a role to play in
                        setting objective standards. For example, in the field of forecasting, the
                        work of Makridakis and colleagues (e.g. Makridakis &amp; Wheelwright,
                        1989), who tested a number of forecasting methods on a wide range of time
                        series, transformed the field -- leading to both methodological and
                        practical advances. Likewise, in machine learning, the general acceptance of
                        the Machine-Learning Database Repository (Murphy &amp; Aha, 1991) as an
                        agreed standard, and its employment in extensive comparative tests (e.g.
                        Michie et al., 1994) has thrown new light on the strengths and weaknesses of
                        competing algorithms.</p>
                    <p>Although billion-byte public-domain archives of text exist, e.g. Project
                        Gutenberg and the Oxford Text Archive, stylometry currently lacks an
                        equivalent set of accepted test problems. Therefore we at Bristol have
                        compiled a textual benchmark suite. The current version of this suite is
                        known as Tbench96. Despite its deficiencies, it does present a broader
                        variety of test problems than other workers in stylometry and allied fields
                        have previously used.</p>
                    <div>
                        <head>1.1 Selection Criteria</head>
                        <p>The text-categorization problems in this suite were selected to fulfil a
                            number of requirements. <list>
                                <item>1. Provenance: the true category of each text should be well
                                    attested.</item>
                                <item>2. Variety: problems other than authorship should be
                                    included.</item>
                                <item>3. Language: not all the texts should be in English.</item>
                                <item>4. Difficulty: both hard and easy problems should be
                                    included.</item>
                                <item>5. Size: the training texts should be of `modest' size, such
                                    as might be expected in practical applicati</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The last point may need amplification. Although some huge text samples
                            are available, most text-classification tasks in real life require
                            decisions to be made on the basis of samples in the order of thousands
                            or tens of thousands of words. An enormous training sample of undisputed
                            text is, therefore, something of a luxury.</p>
                        <p>Subject to these constraints, 13 test problems were chosen: four
                            authorship problems, three chronology problems, three content-based
                            problems, and three miscellaneous problems. As is usual in machine
                            learning, each category of text was divided into non-overlapping
                            training and test sets. See section 2.</p>

                        <head>1.2 Pre-processing</head>
                        <p>In order to impose uniformity of layout and thus reduce the effect of
                            factors such as line-length (not usually an authorial decision) all text
                            samples have been passed through a program called PRETEXT. This program
                            makes some minor formatting changes, e.g. case-folding and conversion of
                            tabs into blanks. However, the most important change made is to break
                            running text into segments that are then treated as cases to be
                            classified.</p>
                        <p>Just what consititutes a natural unit of text is by no means obvious.
                            Different researchers have made different decisions about the best way
                            of segmenting long texts. Some have used fixed-length blocks (e.g.
                            Elliott &amp; Valenza, 1991); others have respected natural
                            subdivisions in the text (e.g. Ule, 1982). Both approaches have merits
                            as well as disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>Because linguistic materials have a hierarchical structure there is no
                            universally correct segmentation scheme. In Tbench96 each block boundary
                            is taken as the first new-line in the text on or after the 999th byte in
                            the block being formed. Such units will be referred to as kilobyte
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>The number of words per kilobyte line varies according to the type of
                            writing. A representative figure for Tbench96 as a whole is 185 words
                            per line. Thus this is an attempt to work with text units near the lower
                            limit of what has previously been considered feasible. Evidence of this
                            is provided by the two quotations below, made 20 years apart. <cit

                                    should anticipate a great deal of unevenness, and that
                                    expectation is confirmed by these results."</quote>

                        <p>Although Felton (1996) has studied 100-word text blocks (in New Testament
                            Greek) and Simonton (1990) even analyzed word usage in the final
                            couplets of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets (averaging 17.6 words each), the
                            block size in Tbench96 is small relative to most previous stylometric
                            studies; therefore it poses a relatively challenging series of tests.

                    <p>The 13 text-classification problems that constitute TBench96 (Text Benchmark
                        Suite, 1996 edition) form an enhanced version of the test suite used by
                        Forsyth (1995). They constitute a potentially valuable resource for future
                        studies in text analysis.</p>
                    <p>Summary information is given below about the texts used in the benchmark
                        suite. Note: A policy adhered to throughout was never to split a single work
                        (article, essay, poem or song) between training and test sets.</p>

                        and Madison. This difficult authorship problem -- subject of a ground-
                        breaking analysis by Mosteller &amp; Wallace (1984 [1964]) -- is
                        possibly the best candidate for an accepted benchmark in stylometry.</p>
                    <p>An electronic text of the entire Federalist papers was obtained by anonymous
                        ftp from Project Gutenberg at GUTNBERG@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu For checking
                        purposes the Dent Everyman edition was used (Hamilton et al., 1992 [1788]).

                        prophetic meditations, and one file of prophetic verse. Smith's three files
                        were all extracts from his diaries. These texts (and others) have been

                    <p>A random selection of poems by Ezra Pound written up to 1926 was taken from
                        Selected Poems 1908-1969 (Pound, 1977), and entered by hand. It was
                        supplemented by random selection of 18 pre-1948 Cantos, obtained from the
                        Oxford Text Archive. Poems by T.S. Eliot were from Collected Poems 1909-1962
                        (Eliot, 1963). A random selection of 148 poems by W.B. Yeats was taken from
                        the Oxford Text Archive. For checking purposes Collected Poems (Yeats, 1961)
                        was used.</p>
                    <p>NAMESAKE (2 classes): Poems by Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas. Songs by Bob Dylan
                        (born Robert A. Zimmerman) were obtained from Lyrics 1962-1985 (Dylan,
                        1994). In addition, two tracks from the album Knocked Out Loaded (Dylan,
                        1988) and the whole A-side of Oh Mercy (Dylan, 1989) were transcribed by

                    <p>Poems of Dylan Thomas were obtained from Collected Poems 1934-1952 (Thomas,
                        1952) with four more early works added from The Notebook Poems 1930-1934

                        output tailed off gradually. The work included is all of A Choice of Emily
                        Dickinson's Verse selected by Ted Hughes (Hughes, 1993) as well as a random
                        selection of 32 other poems from the Complete Poems (edited by T.H. Johnson,
                        1970).</p>
                    <p>JP (3 classes): Poems by John Pudney, divided into three classes. The first
                        category came from Selected Poems (Pudney, 1946) and For Johnny: Poems of
                        World War II (Pudney, 1976); the second from Spill Out (Pudney, 1967) and
                        the third from Spandrels (Pudney, 1969). Every distinct poem in these four
                        books was used.</p>
                    <p>John Pudney (1909-1977) described his career as follows: "My poetic life has
                        been a football match. The war poems were the first half. Then an interval
                        of ten years. Then another go of poetry from 1967 to the present time"
                        (Pudney, 1976). Here the task is to distinguish his war poems (published
                        before 1948) from poems in two other volumes, published in 1967 and 1969. </p>
                    <p>WY (2 classes): Early and late poems of W.B. Yeats. Early work taken as
                        written up to 1914, the start of the First World War, and later work being
                        written in or after 1916, the date of the Irish Easter Rising, which had a
                        profound effect on Yeats's beliefs about poetry.</p>
                    <p>For these problems the classification objective was to discriminate between
                    early and late works by the same poet.</p>

                    <p>MAGS (2 classes): This used articles from two academic journals Literary and
                        Linguistic Computing (75 articles) and Machine Learning (69 articles). The
                        task was to classify texts according to which journal they came from. In
                        fact, each `article' consisted of the Abstract and first paragraph of a
                        single paper.</p>
                    <p>NEWS (4 classes): This data-set consists of News stories extracted from the
                        Associated Press wire service during December 1979. A total of about 250,000
                        words was obtained from the Oxford Text Archive, where it was deposited by
                        Dr G. Akers in 1980. Stories in this archive are classified into at least
                        six mutually exclusive categories. For Tbench96, four of these story types
                        were extracted: F -- Financial stories; I -- International stories; S --
                        Sports stories; and W -- Washington stories. The Washington category covers
                        US domestic politics. For training data stories up to 15th December were
                        used. For test data stories after that date were used.</p>
                    <p>TROY (2 classes): Electronic versions of the complete texts of Homer's Iliad
                        and Odyssey, both transliterated into the Roman alphabet in the same manner,
                        were kindly supplied by Professor Colin Martindale of the University of
                        Maine at Orono. Traditionally each book is divided into 24 sections or
                        `books'. For both works the training sample comprises the odd-numbered books
                        and the test sample consists of the even-numbered books. The classification
                        task is to tell which work each kilobyte line comes from. (It is possible
                        that this task is an authorship discrimination as well (Griffin, 1980).)</p>

                        <head>Miscellaneous:</head>
                    <p>GENDERS (2 classes): short stories written by first-year undergraduate
                        students at the University of Maine on the subject: boy meets girl (or vice
                        versa). These texts were kindly supplied by Professor Colin Martindale of
                        the Psychology Department of the University of Maine at Orono. These stories
                        arrived in an arbitrary order. Even-numbered stories were used as training
                        data, odd numbered stories as test data. The objective was to distinguish
                        tales written by males from those written by females.</p>
                    <p>AUGUSTAN (2 classes): The Augustan Prose Sample donated by Louis T. Milic to
                        the Oxford Text Archive. For details of the rationale behind this corpus and
                        its later development, see Milic (1990). This data consists of extracts by
                        many English authors during the period 1678 to 1725. It is held as a
                        sequence of records each of which contains a single sentence. Sentence
                        boundaries identified by Milic were respected.</p>
                    <p>RASSELAS (2 classes): The complete text of Rasselas by Samuel Johnson,
                        written in 1759. This was obtained in electronic form from the Oxford Text
                        Archive. For checking purposes, the Clarendon Press edition was used
                        (Johnson, 1927 [1759]). This novel consists of 49 chapters. These were
                        allocated alternately to four different files.</p>
                    <p>The inclusion of random or quasi-random data may need justification. The
                        chief objective of doing so here was to provide an opportunity for what
                        statisticians call overfitting to manifest itself. The author's view is that
                        some `null' cases should form part of any benchmark suite: as well as
                        finding what patterns do exist, a good classifier should avoid finding
                        patterns that don't exist.</p>

                    <p>Thanks are due to Dr David Holmes and Professor Colin Martindale for
                        providing some of the text files used in this benchmarking suite, as well as
                        for helpful comments. In addition, the following institutions -- the Oxford
                        Text Archive, Project Gutenberg, and UWE's Bolland Library -- have also
                        provided resources without which this collection could not have been
