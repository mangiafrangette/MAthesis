                <p>With the assistance of grants from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary
                    Education (FIPSE), project teams at Southwest Texas State University and The
                    Pennsylvania State University developed <title level="m">Libra</title>, an
                    authoring system enabling faculty to create multimedia lessons focused on
                    foreign language listening comprehension. The instructional design of <title
                        level="m">Libra</title> is based on research in discourse processing theory
                    and foreign language schema theory. Principles of listening comprehension
                    processes advanced by these theories not only underlie the intended purpose of
                        <title level="m">Libra</title>'s authoring tools but also constitute a set
                    of lesson parameters to be taken into account in courseware development. In
                    their presentation, the presenters will address the implementation of
                    theoretical principles within the authoring system and the realization of those
                    principles in actual lessons.</p>
                <p>Four principles of central importance to foreign language listening comprehension
                    emerge from consideration of the findings of discourse processing theory and
                    schema theory.<list type="bulleted">

                        <item>Comprehenders' knowledge of the logical structure of a text
                            facilitates their development of a coherent view of a text's overall
                            meaning</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>The fundamental principle of discourse processing theory holds that comprehenders
                    actively construct a mental representation of their understanding of the meaning
                    of a text on the basis of information presented in the text and their own
                    pre-existing background knowledge. Text based comprehension processes include
                    comprehenders' initial use of sentence parsing strategies to derive semantic
                    representations of those sentences (micro-level text processing). Comprehenders
                    then relate these semantic representations to those of previously processed
                    sentences to form more general semantic representations (macro-level text
                    processing). As comprehenders proceed through the text, they continue using
                    micro-level and macro-level text processing strategies, integrating new
                    information into their evolving mental representation and discarding irrelevant
                    details in the process, until they arrive at an elaborated model of their
                    understanding of the overall meaning of the text. (See Gernsbacher, 1990;
                    Guindon and Kintsch, 1984; Horiba, 1993; Horiba et al., 1993; Johnson-Laird,
                    1983; Oller, 1996; Singer, 1990, van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983, and Vipond, 1980.)
                    Traditional approaches to foreign language listening comprehension generally
                    emphasize low level information, asking students to recall (sometimes minute)
                    factual information contained within texts. A more thorough understanding of
                    texts clearly requires students to process information at higher processing
                    levels.</p>
                <p>Comprehenders' pre-existing background knowledge is said to be instantiated by
                    statements made early in the text which serve to activate their mental schemata
                    relevant to the topic of communication. They then use this knowledge, and other
                    real-world knowledge, to guide their interpretation of information correctly or
                    incorrectly understood from the text. (See Barry and Lazarte, 1995; Bernhardt
                    and Berkemeyer, 1988; Carrell, 1981, 1983; Hammadou, 1991; Kintsch, 1988; Long,
                    1990; Mueller, 1980; and Rubin, 1994.) Schema theory prescribes the use of
                    advance organizers of various types in instructional materials to activate
                    comprehenders' pertinent background knowledge. (See Bernhardt and James, 1986;
                    Byrnes, 1984; Glover and Dietzer, 1990; Herron, 1994; Herron et al., 1995, and
                    Omaggio-Hadley, 1993.) Advance organizers may take the form of brainstorming
                    about the topic of communication, generating hypotheses about anticipated events
                    in the story, viewing pictures portraying the characters and actions in the
                    story, or learning essential vocabulary expressions used in the story. Once
                    equipped with such preparatory information, students can then set about the task
                    of listening to the text.</p>
                <p>Students whose level of foreign language proficiency falls below the level of the
                    style of language used in a text tend to make predominant use of either
                    micro-level text processing strategies (bottom-up approach) or macro-level text
                    processing strategies (top-down approach). (See Bernhardt and Berkemeyer, 1988;
                    Chamot and Kpper, 1989; O'Malley et al., 1989, and Wolff, 1987.) Students who
                    use exclusively bottom-up processing strategies will typically develop a
                    fragmented view of low level information presented in the text, and those who
                    rely too extensively on top-down processing strategies can easily create a
                    highly idiosyncratic interpretation of the text's major theme(s). In either
                    case, students who make inordinate use of one set of strategies over the other
                    will ultimately fail to arrive at an overall, accurate view of the text's
                    meaning. To be successful comprehenders, most foreign language students need
                    explicit guidance in the appropriate use of both micro-level and macro-level
                    text processing strategies. The use of such bi-directional text processing
                    strategies should guide students to attend to specific information presented in
                    the text while at the same time help them to develop a mental model of its
                    general meaning. (See Carrell, 1988.)</p>
                <p>Comprehenders knowledge of the logical or rhetorical relationships among the
                    narrative components of a text facilitates their development of a coherent view
                    of the text's overall meaning. (See Chaudron and Richards, 1986; Duffy et al.,
                    1990; Jonz, 1989; Kintsch, 1990; Lee and Riley, 1990; Meyer and Freedle, 1984;
                    and Trabasso et al., 1984.) This knowledge plays a central role in macro-level
                    text processing as comprehenders attempt to understand the major ideas presented
                    in the text and to integrate them into their mental representation. If foreign
                    language students are not able to relate larger chunks of the text to each other
                    in some rational manner, they will eventually possess only a disjointed view of
                    the text's meaning.</p>
                <p>The four principles briefly described above formed the research base for <title
                        level="m">Libra</title>'s instructional design. (See Fischer and Farris 1995
                    for a summary of the implementation of instructional principles in the authoring
                    system.) <title level="m">Libra</title>'s authoring tools enable faculty to
                    develop student lessons whose instructional features reflect appropriate
                    listening comprehension strategies and model their effective use. <title
                        level="m">Libra</title>'s tools allow faculty to create, for example,
                    advance organizers which provide multimedia information to preview characters
                    and events in a story, display text maps to explicate the logical structure of
                    the story, and present hyperactive text sequences to preteach salient vocabulary
                    expressions. They also permit faculty to include in student lessons prompting
                    devices and help screens to put macro-level and micro-level information into
                    relief. Perhaps most important, they enable faculty to formulate comprehension
                    questions to confirm students' understanding of the major ideas of the story and
                    also to verify their apprehension of specific language expressions used to
                    convey those ideas. In sum, the <title level="m">Libra</title> contains the
                    instructional components and authoring procedures necessary to create rich
                    learning environments in which to guide students' active use of listening
                    comprehension strategies.</p>
                <p><title level="m">Libra</title> is organized as a set of authoring templates
                    consisting of basic expository displays and four question formats
                    (multiple-choice, checklist, binary checklist, and icon sorting) supported by
                    textual and multimedia feedback. The authoring system also contains four kinds
                    of help screen displays (generic help screens, video-based help screens,
                    language scripts, and dictionaries) along with programmable buttons and fields
                    to provide essential pedagogical support for students. Its authoring tools
                    include multimedia controls (graphics, analog video, digital video, and digital
                    audio), context-sensitive lesson controls for the question formats, and various
                    types of linking procedures--including links to other applications and to world
                    wide web documents. Finally, faculty authors develop lessons in a
                        what-you-see-is-what-<emph rend="bold">
                        <emph rend="underscore">the-student</emph>
                    </emph>-gets environment, giving a consistently clear view of what their final
                    product will look like</p>
                <p>Over 200 faculty members have used <title level="m">Libra</title> to create
                    lessons in a dozen languages ranging from French to Russian and Chinese.
                    Evaluation projects at institutions such as the Catholic University of America,
                    the Pennsylvania State University, Northwestern University, Southwest Texas
                    State University, and the University of Colorado have revealed that
                    well-designed <title level="m">Libra</title> lessons have a measurable impact on
                    student learning. In an early evaluation project at Southwest Texas State
                    University, analysis of student test data showed that the instructional design
                    of lessons developed for beginning French students substantially helped them to
                    understand a French video story. In a carefully controlled experimental
                    situation, students in the experimental group used <title level="m"
                        >Libra</title> lessons designed in accordance with the four instructional
                    principles described above, while students in the control group used <title
                        level="m">Libra</title> lessons which followed a more traditional approach
                    found in most conventional listening programs. Students in the experimental
                    group significantly outperformed students in the control group on all measures
                    used in free recall protocol posttests. More recent analysis of student use data
                    obtained by means of <title level="m">Libra</title>'s tracking mechanism
                    revealed the ways in which students used lesson's instructional components and
                    provided insights into their use of listening comprehension strategies. Analysis
                    of student use data in the context of comparison of those data to students'
                    scores on free recall protocols revealed patterns of strategy use directly
                    related to individual achievement levels.</p>
                <p>The presenters will discuss in their paper the instructional design of <title
                        level="m">Libra</title> and illustrate the operation of its authoring tools.
                    They will also demonstrate sample lessons in French featuring recommended
                    instructional designs based on the principles of discourse processing theory and
                    schema theory. Finally, they will present results of the analysis of student
                    evaluation data and student use data. Evidence collected so far indicates that
                        <title level="m">Libra</title> provides flexible and easy-to-use authoring
                    tools which enable faculty to create instructionally effective language learning
                    lessons. It remains to develop and evaluate <title level="m">Libra</title>
                    lessons designed for more advanced levels of language instruction to yield
                    additional useful insights into foreign language listening comprehension
                    processes.</p>
