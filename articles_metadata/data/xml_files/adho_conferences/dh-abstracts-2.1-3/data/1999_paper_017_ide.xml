            <div>
                <p>It is well known that the most nagging issue for word sense disambiguation (WSD)
                    is the definition of just what a word sense is. At its base, the problem is a
                    philosophical and linguistic one that is far from being resolved. However, work
                    in automated language processing has led to efforts to find practical means to
                    distinguish word senses, at least to the degree that they are useful for natural
                    language processing tasks such as summarization, document retrieval, and machine
                    translation. Several criteria have been suggested and exploited to automatically
                    determine the sense of a word in context, including syntactic behavior, semantic
                    and pragmatic knowledge, and especially in more recent empirical studies, word
                    co-occurrence within syntactic relations (e.g., Hearst, 1991; Yarowsky, 1993),
                    words co-occurring in global context (e.g., Gale et al., 1993; Yarowsky, 1992;
                    Schütze, 1992, 1993), etc. No clear criteria have emerged, however, and the
                    problem continues to loom large for WSD work.</p>
                <p>The notion that cross-lingual comparison can be useful for sense disambiguation
                    has served as a basis for some recent work on WSD. For example, Brown et al.
                    (1991) and Gale et al. (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus
                    of Canadian Parliamentary debates for WSD, and Dagan et al. (1991) and Dagan and
                    Itai (1994) used monolingual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual
                    dictionary. These studies rely on the assumption that the mapping between words
                    and word senses varies significantly among languages. For example, the word duty
                    in English translates into French as devoir in its obligation sense, and impôt
                    in its tax sense. By determining the translation equivalent of duty in a
                    parallel French text, the correct sense of the English word is identified. These
                    studies exploit this information in order to gather co-occurrence data for the
                    different senses, which is then used to disambiguate new texts. In related work,
                    Dyvik (1998) used patterns of translational relations in an English-Norwegian
                    parallel corpus (ENPC, Oslo University) to define semantic properties such as
                    synonymy, ambiguity, vagueness, and semantic fields and suggested a derivation
                    of semantic representations for signs (e.g., lexemes), capturing semantic
                    relationships such as hyponymy etc., from such translational relations.</p>
                <p>Recently, Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) suggested that for the purposes of WSD, the
                    different senses of a word could be determined by considering only sense
                    distinctions that are lexicalized cross-linguistically. In particular, they
                    propose that some set of target languages be identified, and that the sense
                    distinctions to be considered for language processing applications and
                    evaluation be restricted to those that are realized lexically in some minimum
                    subset of those languages. This idea would seem to provide an answer, at least
                    in part, to the problem of determining different senses of a word: intuitively,
                    one assumes that if another language lexicalizes a word in two or more ways,
                    there must be a conceptual motivation. If we look at enough languages, we would
                    be likely to find the significant lexical differences that delimit different
                    senses of a word.</p>
                <p>However, this suggestion raises several questions. For instance, it is well known
                    that many ambiguities are preserved across languages (for example, the French
                    intérêt and the English interest), especially languages that are relatively
                    closely related, such as English and French. Assuming this problem can be
                    overcome, should differences found in closely related languages be given lesser
                    (or greater) weight than those found in more distantly related languages? More
                    generally, which languages should be considered for this exercise? All
                    languages? Closely related languages? Languages from different language
                    families? A mixture of the two? How many languages would be "enough" to provide
                    adequate information for this purpose?</p>
                <p>There is also the question of the criteria that would be used to establish that a
                    sense distinction is "lexicalized cross-linguistically". How consistent must the
                    distinction be? Does it mean that two concepts are expressed by mutually
                    non-interchangeable lexical items in some significant number of other languages,
                    or need it only be the case that the option of a different lexicalization exists
                    in a certain percentage of cases?</p>
                <p>This paper attempts to provide some preliminary answers to these questions, in
                    order to eventually determine the degree to which the use of parallel data is
                    viable to determine sense distinctions, and if so, the ways in which this
                    information might be used. Given the lack of large parallel texts across
                    multiple languages, the study is necessarily limited; however, close examination
                    of a small sample of parallel data can, as a first step, provide the basis and
                    direction for more extensive studies. I have used parallel, aligned versions of
                    George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (Erjavec and Ide, 1998) in five languages:
                    English, Slovene, Estonian, Romanian, and Czech.<note n="1">The Orwell parallel
                        corpus also includes versions of <title level="m">Nineteen-Eighty
                            Four</title> in Hungarian, Bulgarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Serbian, and
                        Russian. </note> The study therefore involves languages from four language
                    families (Germanic, Slavic, Finno-Ugrec, and Romance), as well as two languages
                    from the same family (Czech and Slovene). Four ambiguous English words were
                    considered in this study: hard, line, head, and country. Line and hard were
                    chosen because they have served in various WSD studies to date (e.g., Leacock et
                    al, 1993) and a corpus of occurrences of these words from the Wall Street
                    Journal corpus was generously made available for comparison. Serve, another word
                    frequently used in these studies, did not appear frequently enough in the Orwell
                    text to be considered, nor did any other suitable ambiguous verb. Country and
                    head were chosen as substitutes because they appeared frequently enough for
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>All sentences containing an occurrence or occurrences (including morphological
                    variants) of each of the three words were extracted from the English text,
                    together with the parallel sentences in which they occur in the texts of the
                    four comparison languages (Czech, Estonian, Romanian, Slovene). The English
                    occurrences were grouped into senses, using the relatively coarse sense
                    distinctions in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD)<note n="2">Note
                        that sense divisions for line and hard can be very fine in larger, standard
                        dictionaries, often involving dozens of senses (e.g., in the <title
                            level="m">Collins English Dictionary</title>, line as a noun has 63
                        senses)</note> (used to provide sense distinctions in WordNet [Miller et
                    al., 1990; Fellbaum, forthcoming]). The sense categorization was performed by
                    the author and two student assistants; results from the three were compared and
                    a final, mutually agreeable grouping was established.</p>
                <p>For each of the four comparison languages, the corpus of sense-grouped parallel
                    sentences for English and that language was sent to a linguist and native
                    speaker of the comparison language. The linguists were asked to provide the
                    following information for each word occurrence:<list>
                        <item>1. Provide the lexical item in each parallel sentence that corresponds
                            to the ambiguous English word. If it is inflected, provide both the
                            inflected form and the root form.</item>
                        <item>2. Is the translation one-to-one (i.e., the English word is translated
                            by a single word in your language)? If not, please provide the phrase
                            (or other means) by which it is translated, or indicate that it is not
                            lexicalized.</item>
                        <item>3. Are there obvious synonyms for the word in your language that could
                            have been used instead of the one chosen? Are they better or worse as
                            translations?</item>
                        <item>4. f a given word in any one of its senses is translated using
                            different words in your language (for example, if a word in the "not
                            soft" sense of "hard" is translated differently in different sentences),
                            please indicate why this difference may exist. For example, is it due to
                            the use of a more general term (hyponym)? a more specific word
                            (hypernym)? a different sense?</item>
                        <item>5. Is any of the translations of one of the ambiguous words itself
                            ambiguous in your language? Is the ambiguity the same as in the English?
                            If not, is the word ambiguous among different meanings than those for
                            which it is ambiguous in English? If so, what are its other
                            meanings?</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>In order to determine the degree to which the assigned sense distinctions from
                    the OALD correspond to translation equivalents, a coherence index (CI) was
                    computed that measures the consistency with which a given sense is translated as
                    well as the degree of relationship between two senses. CIs were also computed
                    for each language individually. A simple correlation was then run over all the
                    CI data, providing an index of the degree to which there is an affinity (or
                    disaffinity) between the different senses of a given word in each of these
                    groups. Finally, in order to determine the degree to which the linguistic
                    relation between languages may affect coherence, a correlation was run among CIs
                    for all pairs of the four target languages.</p>
                <p>The results, which will be fully outlined in the final paper, show that
                    cross-lingual information may be useful for automatic disambiguation, especially
                    for gross sense distinctions. More interestingly, the data suggest that
                    translation equivalents may provide a valuable source of information for
                    determining sense distinctions, by providing an indication of the relatedness
                    between sense s of a given word that are derived from standard dictionaries. In
                    particular, the CI's can be used to define a "map" depicting the relative
                    distance between senses. This information can in turn serve as a basis for
                    collapsing two senses when the cross-lingual data suggest that their meanings
                    are nearly interchangeable or for recognizing them as relatively distinct. An
                    even more promising approach for sense determination is to use information about
                    translation equivalents to group word occurrences into sense clusters without
                    assigning or considering senses defined a priori in a dictionary. We are
                    exploring this last idea and will have additional results to report in the final
                    paper.</p>
