                    <head>Session Topic</head>
                    <p>This session will include papers by two Kingston-based collaborators engaged
                        in electronically writing, designing and publishing an interactive
                        introduction to the history of the Classical tradition in architecture.
                        Apart from its text, this project has an important visual component
                        consisting of the images electronically reproduced in close conjunction with
                        the ongoing verbal narrative. In addition the two papers (and the
                        presentation that will accompany them) demonstrate the role of certain
                        interactive functions growing out of, and intended to re-enforce, the text
                        as well as the images. These new interactive techniques, in addition to
                        tried and true cross referencing methods, invite the participation of the
                        reader to an unheralded extent. Aimed at a wide range of potential users,
                        the publication captures the sometimes serendipitous excitement of the
                        classroom. The third paper introduces the Arts and Humanities Data Service
                        in the UK whose mandate is to coordinate access to, and facilitate the
                        creation and use of, electronic resources. Attention will be paid to the
                        role of the AHDS's Visual Arts Data Service in a world of rapidly
                        proliferating digital images and image collections. Strategies will be
                        discussed regarding the creation, accessibility, preservation and
                        intellectual "rights" related to digital images.</p>

                                <p>The classroom is a crucible. The active ingredients in it are
                                    normally the lectures of the professor, the interventions of the
                                    students and the interaction between the two. To this
                                    quasi-chemical equation teachers in the visual arts add the
                                    factor of images â€“ usually in the form of slides or actual works
                                    of art, but increasingly in the form of digitized images on a
                                    monitor. This paper seeks to analyze the mixture in the crucible
                                    with special reference to the history of architecture and an
                                    electronic publication in progress devoted to the Classical
                                    tradition from Antiquity to the present day. By discussing
                                    certain story-boarding techniques, familiar from the art of the
                                    cinema, the paper shows how the classroom's stimulating but
                                    unpredictable atmosphere of inquiry can be electronically
                                    approximated through the appropriate juxtaposition of words and
                                    images. A prototype presentation will accompany this paper, and
                                    relates to others in the same session. Under the working title,
                                        <emph rend="italics">A History of the Classical Tradition in
                                        Architecture</emph>, the first phase of the current project
                                    has been underway for almost 8 months as part of a three-year
                                    research grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities
                                    Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). The primary source material
                                    consists of lecture texts from an introductory course to the
                                    history of architecture formulated over the past six years. In
                                    addition, about 1500 of the projected 2500 slides have already
                                    been photographed by the author and some have been digitized.
                                    The images also include material from the rare book, prints and
                                    drawings collection of the Canadian Centre for Architecture in
                                    Montreal, which is a partner in the venture. In this way, and
                                    because of the special copyright status of buildings, the
                                    electronic publication will be relatively free of copyright
                                    restrictions.</p>
                                <p>To facilitate "navigation" through the document, the electronic
                                    publication relies heavily on geography, a natural enough choice
                                    when dealing with works of architecture. Buildings discussed are
                                    located in time and space and are interrelated to one another to
                                    form an integrated, balanced, and harmonious whole, as suits the
                                    Classical subject matter. A principal path through the material
                                    permits users at all levels of interest and computer literacy to
                                    read the text and images much as in a book. But numerous
                                    "alleyways" off to all sides of the principal path form the
                                    heart of the interactive and specifically electronic nature of
                                    the publication, and challenge the more adventurous user. Some
                                    of these interactive techniques currently under exploration
                                    include the following:<list type="bulleted">

                                <p>Throughout the publication the interactive capabilities remain in
                                    balance with the demands of the textual narrative. Neither one
                                    overrules the other, nor restricts readership. For a beginner
                                    the publication opens the doors to the enjoyment of
                                    architecture. For the armchair traveler the text and images
                                    provide happy recollections or excite anticipation. For the
                                    experienced student, architect or scholar the publication
                                    creates challenging new ways of looking at architecture, its
                                    creative process, and the relevance of past to present and
                                    future. In the final analysis, the publication also reflects the
                                    personality of its author: his education; his travels; his
                                    publications; his enthusiasms; and last but not least the impact
                                    of electronic publication upon his way of writing.. (The
                                    principal path has not been a one way street.) By taking into
                                    account the flexibility of the electronic medium, the material
                                    is arranged with unheralded ease, thus bringing to light
                                    overarching and even unexpected typologies or themes. In this
                                    way the new medium actually suggests new ways of looking at
                                    familiar material, because the interpolation of text with images
                                    has a rationale all its own. The reader is invited to question
                                    these themes, to explore them in new ways, and thereby to become
                                    increasingly engaged in the subject of architectural history.
                                    Above all, by using the electronic medium creatively, the
                                    present project underscores both visually and verbally the
                                    publication's central thesis of continuity within the Classical
                                    tradition.</p>

                                <p>Electronic publications are now part of everyday life. Yet many
                                    of them fail to engage their users effectively. Why so?</p>
                                <p>If you are thinking of producing an electronic publication, what
                                    can you do to ensure its users find it easy and enjoyable to
                                    use?</p>
                                <p>How can the publication guide its users and emulate the absent
                                    teacher?</p>
                                <p>This paper describes some of the issues involved, and sets forth
                                    principles for designing attractive yet functional user
                                    interfaces. It shows examples from various existing electronic
                                    publications, and from a CD-ROM on the Classical Tradition in

                                <p>The development of increasingly affordable digital imaging
                                    technologies combined with the extension of the Internet and of
                                    the worldwide web, has resulted in an outpouring of highly
                                    distributed digital images and image collections with
                                    significant cross-disciplinary and secondary use value for
                                    humanities scholars. That value, however, cannot be realised
                                    unless digital images are created, documented, and maintained in
                                    a manner which permits their ready location, interchange, and
                                    secondary use. The challenge is only partly methodological and
                                    technical. We may also need to explore new and creative ways to
                                    manage relations between those who "own" rights in image
                                    resources and those who have an interest in acquiring access to
                                    them.</p>
                                <p>This paper will introduce the Arts and Humanities Data Service
                                    (AHDS) â€” a new national service established in the UK to
                                    coordinate access to and facilitate the creation and use of
                                    electronic resources in the arts and humanities. The AHDS is a
                                    distributed service comprising a managing Executive and five
                                    Service Providers respectively serving the interests of

                                    catalogue, manage and preserve digital collections which are of
                                    interest to particular scholarly constituencies, while the
                                    Executive will take on a managing and integrating role. Given
                                    the distributed, mixed media, and interdisciplinary nature of
                                    its digital collections, the AHDS may anticipate developmental
