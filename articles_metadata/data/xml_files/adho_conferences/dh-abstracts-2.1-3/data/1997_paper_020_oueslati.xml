                    <head>Introduction</head>
                    <p>The design of linguistic tools can be a helpful aid to a linguist exploring
                        concepts and relations in texts. Analysing texts and acquiring linguistic
                        concepts from corpora may be an interactive, successive- refinement process.
                        A linguist may analyse a domain text and perform a series of experiments (he
                        may explore a list of domain terms, search for contexts, and then
                        interpretes the results) to search for linguistic concepts. For such a
                        research approach to be practical, a linguist needs a user-friendly system
                        that supports:<list>
                            <item>- text analysis without requiring the user to be aware of the
                                storage structures and processing strategies involved</item>
                            <item>- easy formulation and execution of queries against the
                                text</item>
                            <item>- a natural representation of the relationships between words,
                                terms and linguistic concepts in texts.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>To perform text analysis and knowledge exploration we developed an
                        environment called LEXICA (lexical and linguistic concept acquisition) which
                        processes texts and allows the user (a linguist or a terminologist) to enter
                        a query in order to search for linguistic concepts in texts.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>1. The major design goals of LEXICA</head>
                    <p>The process of acquisition and exploitation of linguistic knowledge from
                        texts is seen as an important issue to help the construction of knowledge
                        bases (Czap and Nedobity, 1990) , (Meyer, et al., 1992) , (Skuce, 1993). The
                        major design goals of our system that contibute to its usefulness as an
                        environment for linguistic knowledge acquisition and structuring are to:<list>
                            <item>- provide a set of modules to perform text analysis</item>
                            <item>- provide a query facility to search for linguistic
                                concepts</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>2. How LEXICA can help a linguist</head>
                    <p>Consider a linguist charged with studying domain-specific relations. One way
                        to search for these relations is to formulate a query which search for
                        co-occuring domain terms. For instance, the linguist can enter the following
                        formula: art+term+verb+art+term (an article followed by a term followed by a
                        verb, followed by an article followed by a term) which can be seen as a list
                        of liguistic constraints performed in order to search for all contexts of
                        two terms which co-occur in the context of a verb.</p>
                    <p>First of all this paper discusses methodologies for term and linguistic
                        knowledge acquisition from texts and describes our system LEXICA (section
                        3). Then we describe how such a system can be efficient to support tasks of
                        linguistic knowledge acquisition and exploitation (section 4). Finally, the
                        paper closes with a brief overview (section 5).</p>

                        <head>3.1 Introduction</head>
                        <p>Corpora-based techniques have been widely used for term acquisition and
                            text analysis (Delisle and Szpakowics, 1991) , (Delisle, et al., 1994) ,
                            (Müller, 1989). Classical methods often use grammars and domain
                            dictionaries (Mars, et al., 1994). They cannot be used in totally new
                            domains where domain dictionaries and conceptual hierarchies have not
                            yet been established. Such a process is time consuming. We propose to
                            use an original method to text analysis which uses repeated word
                            sequences to identify terms denoting concept labels and perform term
                            structuring.</p>

                        <head>3.2. Description of our system</head>
                        <p>Our system is implemented in Maccintosh Common Lisp on a Mac station. Two
                            parts of the system have to be differentiated:<list>
                                <item>1) a preprocessing part (modules: MANTEX, TSTRUCT, VERB) which
                                    performs text and term processing and structuring
                                    (identification of words, sentences, collocations, terms). </item>
                                <item>2) a query part (LEX module) which is a user-friendly langage
                                    which allow the user to handle a set of predefined linguistic
                                    categories and search for linguistic relations.</item>
                            </list></p>

                                <eg>- The MANTEX module
                               
                                      &lt;Conceptual diagram&gt;:
                               
                                      Text --> MANTEX --> term candidates --> term validation
                                                          (automatic)         (interactive)</eg>

                            </p>
                            <p>Many term acquisition tools (Enguehard, 1992) , (Smadja, 1993) ,
                                (Bourrigault and Condamines, 1995) , (Justeson and Katz, 1995)
                                (Reinert, 1995) use different methods to perform term acquisition
                                and linguistic knowledge structuring. For instance, Smadja uses
                                statistical methods to collect relevant pairs of co-occuring words,
                                which are then used to reconstruct n-word collocations (called
                                n-grams).</p>
                            <p>Our approach to term acquisition uses repeated word sequences and
                                word distributions to help locate meaningful entities in text.
                                Repeated word sequences (Lebart and Salem, 1994) are n-word strings
                                (n > 1) occurring at least twice in the text (strings containing
                                punctuation are not considered). The semantic hypothesis behind
                                repeated word sequences is based on Harris (Harris, 1968) .
                                According to Harris, language offers discrete and arbitrary
                                linguistic units which may be clustered according to linguistic
                                constraints (i.e., terms are made up of linguistic units chosen to
                                cluster according to linguistic constraints). MANTEX generates a
                                list of term candidates which may be validated by a terminologist.</p>

                                <eg>- The TSTRUCT module
                                      
                                      &lt;Conceptual diagram&gt;:
                                      Terms --> TSTRUCT module --> term tree
                                                  (automatic)</eg>
                            </p>
                            <p>The TSTRUCT module produces a structured list of terms: generally
                                terms can occur in texts with different extensions, the main term
                                can be seen as the head of a tree and extensions as branches. For
                                instance, in French, the first noun of a noun phrase usually
                                expresses the main concept, while the rest expresses specification. </p>
                            <p>While our system has specifically addressed only French terminology
                                we think it can easily be transported to other languages. For
                                instance we are working on extracting terms from a genetic
                                engineering corpus in English. For instance, in "DNA molecules" the
                                main concept is "DNA" and "molecules" is used to specify the main
                                concept. example of a term tree:<lb/>
                                <eg>                  (DNA)
                                                        !
                                    --------------------------------------------------
                                    !                 !        !            !

                            </p>
                            <p>In English the problem is that the main noun in a noun phrase is
                                often the last, as in (DNA STRANDS) but may sometimes be the first
                                as in (STRANDS OF DNA).</p>

                            <p>To build a list of domain verbs we use a set of morphological rules:

                                word (w) ends with a member (m) of (L) then our system supposes the
                                string consisting of (w) without (m) is a radical candidate. If this
                                candidate is also found with another member of (L) then it is
                                retained as a verb (for example, "montr(ent)" and "montr(ait)" -->
                                the verb is :"montr(er)").</p>

                                morphological data (the different forms of a verb, terms in a

                            <p>- A personalized dictionary</p>
                            <p>The linguist may use a personalized dictionary which contains a few
                                predefined linguistic categories such as: art: for article term: for
                                term, etc.. In addition, he may interact with the system to create
                                new categories. For instance, he may create the category: det (as
                                determinant) which may refer to the following linguistic categories:
                                article (a, an, the), possessive adjectives (his, her, ...).</p>
                            <p>The following table resumes the predefined categories: <table

                            <p>- The LEXICA formula</p>
                            <p>The LEXICA formula is a list of constraints: C1, .., Cn each
                                constraint of the formula may be a variable, a string of text, or
                                linguistic category. Variables and categories may be followed by a
                                list of logical predicates (a Lisp like form). For instance, the
                                user may specifie that a constraint is the verb "to contain":
                                verb/(="contain").</p>
                            <p>Two parts of the system have to be differentiated: - the local
                                constraints (described above) - the global constraints: they are
                                specified at the end of the formula (after the sign "&amp;") and
                                they are applied to the whole formula. For instance the user
                                executes the formula art+x+verb+y and may describe that the number
                                of the contexts to be found is equal to the value1. After adding the
                                global constraints the formula is now: art+x+verb+y &amp;
                                (context= 1) In order to express local and global constraints, we
                                developed a set of predefined predicates which may be used in a
                                formula, for instance: <table rows="10" cols="2">

                    <p>In this section we will describe how the terms can be exploited to handle
                        relations which hold between terms. We are interested in external relations
                        which hold between two terms: term1 and term2 . Our main idea is that a verb
                        occurring with two terms: &lt;term1 verb term2&gt; may describe a
                        domain-specific relation.</p>
                    <p>1) example: we apply the following formula: term+verb/(="montrer")+term
                        &amp; (context> 1). The LEX module collects contexts containing two
                        terms which co-occur with the verb "montrer" (to show): <table rows="9"

                    <p>We described in this paper a linguistic environment called LEXICA which is
                        effective for identifying terms and other linguistic categories. On the
                        basis of some example texts, we illustrated how terms can be exploited to
                        identify domain-specific relations. The language used by LEXICA allows the
                        user to enter a query in the form of a list of linguistic constraints
                        (described by labels and predicates) in order to search for contexts, and
                        explore new linguistic concepts in texts.</p>
