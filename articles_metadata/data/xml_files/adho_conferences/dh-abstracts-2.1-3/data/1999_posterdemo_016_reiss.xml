                <p>In <title level="m">Engines of Inquiry: Teaching, Technology, and
                        Learner-Centered Approaches to Culture and History</title>, Randy Bass
                    identifies "six kinds of quality learning" that "information technologies can
                    serve to enhance": distributive learning, authentic tasks and complex inquiry,
                    dialogic learning, constructive learning, public accountability, and reflective
                    and critical thinking. Providing all six of these experiences is a challenge for
                    a state community college like mine, Tidewater Community College, Virginia
                    Beach, Virginia.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, using the resources of the community as well as free and low-cost
                    Internet applications, an online class can incorporate quality computer-mediated
                    learning, as this poster presentation will demonstrate with several
                    undergraduate projects from an open-admissions online humanities elective,
                        <title level="m">Technology and the Liberal Arts: Man, Woman,
                        Machine</title> &lt;<ptr
                        target="http://www.tc.cc.va.us/faculty/tcreisd/techarts/"/>&gt;.</p>
                <p>Students typically are drawn to this class not by the "arts" in the title but by
                    the "technology." By the end of the term, students have used technology as one
                    approach to understanding some of the fine arts, have reflected on the
                    technologies used in creating and maintaining works of art, and have constructed
                    their own works of art and electronic portfolios.</p>
