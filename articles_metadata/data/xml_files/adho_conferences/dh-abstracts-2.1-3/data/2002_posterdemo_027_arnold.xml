                    <p>Analysing the language of a literary text is a complex undertaking. In order
                        to obtain a complete survey of the literary idiolect of a particular writer,
                        as defined by his use of individual word and syntactic style, author
                        dictionaries have proved to be a reliable and informative source of data.
                        Such data, in the form of a corpus, lends itself to analytical
                        interpretation by providing a basis for literary and linguistic exegesis.
                        This presentation will introduce a project, namely the construction of a
                        dictionary based on a German novel of the early 19th century, '<title
                            level="m">Nachtwachen von Bonaventura</title>' (<title level="m">Night
                            Watches of Bonaventura</title>'). Various aspects of computer-based
                        research in author lexicography will be discussed, focussing on statistical
                        methods that can be used as a basis for extracting characteristic features
                        of style and lexis.</p>

                    <p>The creation of a dictionary based on the '<title level="m">Night Watches of
                            Bonaventura</title>' presented itself as a rewarding and challenging
                        task for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would make a contribution to the
                        rather neglected area of author lexicography in general (Mattausch 1990,
                        1558). Secondly, because a dictionary of this particular text has not
                        previously been compiled, although the novel is widely considered to be a
                        valuable source for literary, linguistic and computational research. A
                        dictionary of the '<title level="m">Night Watches</title>' appeared able to
                        serve all of these purposes simultaneously. Being a systematically ordered
                        collection of language material and with its XML-encoded structure, the
                        lexicon is intended to be a prototype example of the capabilities of
                        text-based computing in the humanities, offering easy access to semantic
                        definitions as well as to a set of sense relations.</p>
                    <p>Following decades of speculation concerning authorship of the novel, which
                        was published under the pseudonym 'Bonaventura' in 1804, it can now be taken
                        as certain that August Klingemann, who had formerly been regarded as a
                        rather marginal figure in German Romanticism, indeed wrote the '<title
                            level="m">Night Watches</title>'. The techniques employed to unlock the
                        puzzle of who wrote as 'Bonaventura' ranged from frequency counts (Fleig
                        1985) to sophisticated computer-aided approaches (Wickmann 1974).
                        Irrefutable evidence of Klingemann's authorship emerged when an autograph
                        originating from him was found in 1987, citing the '<title level="m">Night
                            Watches</title>' among his other works (Haag 1987). Knowing who
                        'Bonaventura' really was marked the beginning of a new epoch in research on
                        the novel. Now it is the text itself that attracts scholars, as one of the
                        most recent publications indicates (Kaminski 2001).</p>

                            Bonaventura</title>’</head>
                    <p>Compiling a dictionary and processing items of vocabulary lexicographically
                        both require one simple question to be resolved at the very outset: "What is
                        a word?" Defining the term 'word' as a primitive carrier of meaning that
                        exists independently of the syntactical structure (Duden-Grammatik 1998,
                        870), is certainly an attractive assumption, but it provides no help in
                        carried out computer-aided text analysis for a language like German, which
                        is extraordinarily rich in displaying phenomena such as separable prefixes
                        that appear as "words" in the data file but are not independent of other
                        elements of the sentence.</p>
                    <p>Neither is it clear whether abbreviations, numbers or symbols such as Greek
                        letters, which are employed quite frequently throughout the novel, ought to
                        be treated as other lemmata or extracted from the word list and presented in
                        an appendix. Equally troublesome is the problem of proper names. One wonders
                        whether proper names are proper words at all or whether their status within
                        the system of language is somewhat different as they refer to individuals
                        rather than general ideas (Lerner/Zimmermann 1991, 349).</p>
                    <p>Reviewing the statistical aspects of the corpus material leads to some
                        fascinating conclusions about the essential ingredients of a literary text.
                        "Crunching numbers" in Bonaventura's 16 '<title level="m">Night
                            Watches</title>', the 16 chapters in which the novel is organized, works
                        on several levels. Counting all the separate "word" units within each
                        sentence produces a total of 38,785 tokens to be identified by a
                        word-processing programme. Using Tustep to generate a Kwic-Index of these
                        parts of speech produces a list of 8,522 types. This number shrinks again
                        after having reduced the inflected word forms to their canonical form. This
                        means that we can reduce the '<title level="m">Night Watches</title>' to a
                        list of 5739 lemmata in terms of our dictionary.</p>
                    <p>Not all words appear with equal frequency in the novel. Not surprisingly are
                        there more contextual occurrences of articles, conjunctions and auxiliary
                        verbs than of nouns and other mere grammatical words. With a total number of
                        6,692 occurrences for all the nouns they only form 17.25% of the whole
                        novel, while this number is easily topped just by counting all the
                        occurrences for the definite articles <emph rend="italics">der, die,
                            das</emph> (3,576 occurrences), the conjunction <emph rend="italics"
                            >und</emph> (1,689 occurrences) and the pronouns <emph rend="italics"
                            >er, sie, es</emph>(1,575 occurrences).</p>
                    <p>Although these functional words clearly dominate the text, their semantic
                        meaning remains mainly on the surface. Focussing on the most frequent nouns
                        on the other hand is much more rewarding in terms of meaning and
                        interpretational value. A survey such as that given in figure 1 produces a
                        puzzling effect: <emph rend="italics">Mensch</emph> ('human being'; 83
                        occurrences), <emph rend="italics">Teufel</emph> ('devil'; 56 occurrences), <emph rend="italics"
                            >Nacht</emph> ('night'; 53 occurrences), <emph rend="italics"
                            >Kopf</emph> ('head'; 51 occurrences), <emph rend="italics">Hand</emph>
                        ('hand'; 50 occurrences), <emph rend="italics">Zeit</emph> ('time'; 50
                        occurrences), <emph rend="italics">Gott</emph> ('god'; 49 occurrences),
                            <emph rend="italics">Himmel</emph> ('heaven/sky'; 49 occurrences), <emph
                            rend="italics">Liebe</emph> ('love'; 47 occurrences) and <emph
                            rend="italics">Tod</emph> ('death'; 43 occurrences) are only ten
                        different types, but they seem to be enough to express the content of the
                            '<title level="m">Night Watches</title>', disregarding the rest of the
                        novel.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <head>Figure 1: frequency count of nouns </head>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Another surprising figure is the percentage of those words that appear only
                        once in the whole of the text: 54.8% of all lemmata are employed only once
                        throughout the novel, leaving 3,146 entries in the dictionary with single
                        occurrences.</p>
                    <p>Some words show a significantly high number of occurrences concentrated in
                        certain '<title level="m">Night Watches</title>' only. The verb <emph
                            rend="italics">lieben</emph> ('to love') for instance occurs 30 times
                        throughout the whole of the novel, with an average number of zero to four
                        occurrences per chapter. Although the semantics of 'love' are implicitly
                        dealt with in almost each '<title level="m">Night Watch</title>', there is
                        only one statistical peak in chapter XIV with 12 references close together.
                        The antonymic <emph rend="italics">hassen</emph> ('to hate') on the other
                        hand appears only 12 times showing no significant peak at all (figure
                        2).</p>
                    <p>Retrieving this sort of information might most conveniently be supported by a
                        computational programme, e.g. Tom Horton's <emph rend="italics"
                            >WordCluster</emph> ( <ptr
                            target="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~horton/cs494/examples/wordcluster/wdc/readme.txt"
                        />) as the method applied so far, despite using Tustep, still requires
                        several repetitive procedural actions and quite a considerable amount of
                        tedious manual interferences.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <head>figure 2: distributional relations of 'lieben / Liebe - hassen / Hass
                            '</head>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Expressing lexical material in terms of such precise statistics contributes
                        to a deeper understanding of what poetic texts consist of. For the '<title
                            level="m">Night Watches</title>' surveys like these become even more
                        relevant, especially as doubts are still expressed as to the work's
                        authorship. Assuming that Klingemann was involved in authorship, one recent
                        publication nevertheless suggests that some parts might originate from
                        another writer, Clemens Brentano (Braeuer-Ewers 1995, 13).
                        Computer-generated comparative studies of a variety of narrative prose
                        showing distributional relations like the above may certainly help to
                        develop a further insight into the concept of an 'idiolectal fingerprint'
                        (Cluett 1976).</p>

                    <p>Analysing frequency counts and distributional relations are certainly not the
                        only way in which a dictionary of Klingemann's '<title level="m">Night
                            Watches of Bonaventura</title>' can be used in a linguistic context. As
                        an illustrative article (figure 3) indicates, the dictionary can be used for
                        different purposes.</p>

                        <head>figure 3: example of a dictionary article</head>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Besides lemma, word class, frequency, definition and contextual reference
                        there is a sophisticated system of cross-references at the bottom of each
                        entry. Here hints on word-formation are given and sense-related pointers
                        create a network structure of meanings. Each article is generated by
                        consulting a number of lexicographical reference works. Comparing the
                        semantic commentaries of dictionaries published during the 18th and 19th
                        century (Adelung 1793-1801; Campe 1807-11; Grimm 1854-1961) with a reliable
                        reference work of contemporary German (Duden 1999) leads to insights into
                        the history of words, including aspects of lexicalisation and changes in
                        meaning and usage.</p>
                    <p>The dictionary on the ‘<title level="m">Night Watches of Bonaventura</title>’
                        is just one part of a larger project dealing with August Klingemann. As
                        mentioned above linguistic research has to a great extent concentrated on
                        isolating typical idiolectal ways of expression within the novel for the
                        purpose of proving authorship. Now that we know its author it makes sense to
                        compare the vocabulary employed in the ‘<title level="m">Night
                            Watches</title>’ to that of other items of written work left by
                        Klingemann. The application of IT facilities may provide interesting
                        insights into these, too, pointing the way to further potential of
                        computer-aided research in the field of author lexicography.</p>
