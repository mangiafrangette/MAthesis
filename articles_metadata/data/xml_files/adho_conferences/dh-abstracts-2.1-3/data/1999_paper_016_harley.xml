                <p>Research universities or "multiversities" (Kerr, 1994) are under increasing
                    pressure to develop and evaluate models of how best to utilize the new digital
                    communication technologies to enhance their complex institutional missions of
                    research, undergraduate teaching, and service (Trow, 1997). There are many
                    institutional models that promote the importance of centralized support
                    structures (e.g., Bates, 1997, Katz and Associates; 1999, Laurillard, 1995).
                    These models may be particularly useful for institutions that have either
                    identified distance education as their primary mission, or have made strategic
                    decisions to engage regular faculty in distance education activities, or are
                    small in size.</p>
                <p>They may not, however, prove entirely useful for institutions where research is
                    emphasized and more than a few faculty are skeptical of technology's educational
                    potential. In these latter environments, creating strategies that will involve
                    more than a handful of regular faculty in educational technology development and
                    innovation will require discipline-specific and faculty-sanctioned approaches
                    that serve the tightly coupled missions of research, undergraduate teaching, and
                    graduate student training and placement. The latter is especially pressing in
                    the humanities, where there is currently an oversupply of Ph.D's relative to the
                    academic job market, and a perception that the relevance of humanists to the
                    world outside of academe is waning (Weisbuch, 1999). These trends, combined with
                    predictions for a transformation of the academic labor market (Schuster, 1997)
                    and burgeoning opportunities for Mode II knowledge production in the "culture
                    industry" (Gibbons et al., 1994), suggest novel approaches for preparing
                    humanities graduate students for the world beyond the Ph.D.</p>
                <p>This paper will briefly describe the genesis, status, and impact of a model that
                    attempts to address the training and support of humanities graduate students in
                    the creation and dissemination of web-based curricular materials. The U.C.
                    Berkeley's Humanities and Technology (H&amp;T) Project (<ptr
                        target="http://ishi.berkeley.edu/humanities"/>) was a response to the
                    frustration experienced by humanities faculty on the UC Berkeley campus with
                    regard to the absence of a comprehensible institutional, financial, and on-line
                    support structure (Campus Computing Commission Report; 1998; Faculty Internet
                    Survey, 1998). This project's goals are: (1) To support the integration of WWW
                    and Internet applications into humanities teaching and research; (2) Provide
                    graduate student support and training in utilizing these technologies; (3)
                    Provide a one-stop, technologically "smart" venue where graduate students can
                    meet to share knowledge and collaborate in developing new Internet
                    applications.</p>
                <p>From its inception, the H&amp;T Project's primary assumption has been that most
                    humanities faculty themselves have neither the time nor the interest in becoming
                    computer experts--but they do need help in utilizing internet tools for their
                    teaching and research. Our conviction has been that graduate students, provided
                    with sufficient resources, are the best source of faculty support for technology
                    applications. In that spirit, we set out to create a low-cost and
                    administratively simple model that attempts to assemble a core of graduate
                    students with working knowledge of Web technology. These graduate students have
                    the opportunity to directly share that knowledge with those faculty and graduate
                    students who want to develop course home pages and other creative uses of the
                    Internet. One of the strengths of the model is its focus on content, rather than
                    on the technology for its own sake; it is a project born out of pedagogy and
                    scholarship rather than technology.</p>
                <p>We agree with Katz (1999) that technology will only enhance humanities
                    scholarship if scholars familiar with the content are directing the endeavor. We
                    would further suggest that at a research university like UC Berkeley, graduate
                    students, both those who are beginning to explore a field and those who have a
                    firm grasp of their dissertation topics, are an excellent interface between the
                    faculty member and the application. Technical specialists, although essential,
                    cannot understand the scholarly and pedagogical principles that must underlie
                    good materials development. By supporting graduate students in their
                    experimentation, the university can help generate new electronic resources that
                    will enhance the creation, transmission, preservation, and assessment of
                    knowledge. An important corollary of this activity is that the knowledge that is
                    created and preserved can be accessed by those populations, such as high school
                    students and teachers, that have been traditionally underserved by university
                    scholars.</p>
                <p>Centralized support structures are certainly useful for many of the problems
                    research universities face in integrating new communication technologies into
                    academic missions. Additional strategies that are geared specifically to the
                    requirements of humanities computing need to be crafted as well. These
                    strategies should ensure that faculty have easy access to low-level technical
                    support and that serious enthusiasts are provided with resources to develop
                    sophisticated applications. They should also provide a pool of money earmarked
                    for graduate student experimentation with Web-based curricular materials. These
                    latter resources, wisely deployed, can be a cost-effective and productive way to
                    invest both in the creation of digital curricular resources and in the future
                    careers of humanities graduate students.</p>
                <p>Indeed, training and supporting graduate students in creative uses of web
                    technologies can help them compete more effectively in the academic job market
                    in obvious ways. Less obvious, but no less important, is how this training and
                    support can prepare graduate students for employment in a booming culture
                    industry. Gibbons et al. (1994) suggest that the radical influence of new
                    technologies on this industry, and its increasing dependence on visual
                    sensibility and oral skills, is redefining what it means to be literate. By
                    providing graduate students with tools to communicate the importance of the
                    humanities more effectively to the wider world, universities can take up
                    Weisbuch's (1999) challenge and unleash the humanities from the insularity of
                    academe.</p>
