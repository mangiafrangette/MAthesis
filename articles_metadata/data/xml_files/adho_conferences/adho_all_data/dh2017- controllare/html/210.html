<p><span class="font2">As a social media platform, Twitter (twitter.com) offers opportunities to examine public reactions in&nbsp;what could be described as the world's largest village&nbsp;square. Twitter provides an opportunity not only to&nbsp;participate in public discourse, but even to shape it.&nbsp;However, to fully understand this discourse, it is helpful to understand the people behind the discourse.&nbsp;Stylometric authorship profiling (Argamon, et al,&nbsp;2009) provides an example of this. People are free to&nbsp;post their opinions, but by analyzing the writing style&nbsp;of the individual tweets, we can infer other attributes&nbsp;of the individual authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, we infer personality categories using the well-known Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI)&nbsp;to analyze whether or not there are any differences between the supporters (and detractors) of the major&nbsp;party candidates, Hillary Clinton (D) and Donald&nbsp;Trump (R). The MBTI categorizes people along four&nbsp;major axes, as encoded in a four-character summary&nbsp;(for example, ENFJ: Extroverted, iNtuitive, Feeling,&nbsp;Judging). We have shown (Gray and Juola, 2011; Juola&nbsp;et al., 2013) that personality can be inferred with high&nbsp;accuracy from writing, and further that MBTI personality types can be gleaned specifically from Twitter&nbsp;feeds. Using The EthosIO system developed by Juola &amp;&nbsp;Associates (<a href="http://www.ethosio.com">www.ethosio.com</a>), we have applied this&nbsp;(Juola, Vinsick, and Ryan, 2016) to large-scale analyses&nbsp;of the demographics of personality on Twitter, finding&nbsp;substantial differences between the accepted distribution of personality in the general US population and&nbsp;between the distribution of personality among active&nbsp;Twitter participants. For example, introverts make up&nbsp;approximately 50% of the general US population, but&nbsp;nearly 80% of active Twitter users. Similarly, nearly&nbsp;3/5 of the general US population are &quot;sensing&quot; (S) [as&nbsp;opposed to &quot;intuitive&quot; (N)], but half or fewer Twitter&nbsp;users are. Two specific subgroups, INFP and INFJ, are&nbsp;vastly overrepresented on Twitter, being only about&nbsp;5% of the overall US population, but 30% or more of&nbsp;the samples gleaned from Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We extend this to analyzing personality differences between politically disparate groups of Twitter participants. As with (Juola, Vinsick, and Ryan, 2016), we&nbsp;harvested a large group of user names from the Twitter sample feed, selecting users whose public tweets&nbsp;included one of several political hashtags. Based on&nbsp;the hashtags seen, we divided participants into four&nbsp;groups: anti-Clinton (identified by one or more of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'#NeverHillary', '#CrookedHillary', '#WhichHillary', '#DraftOurDaughters', '#hillary4prison', '#hil-lary4prison2016', '#StopHillary', '#CrimeWithHer', or&nbsp;'#Killary'); pro-Clinton ('#ImWithHer', '#Clinton',&nbsp;'#ClintonKaine16', '#ClintonKaine2016', '#Hil-laryClinton'], '#ClintonKaine', '#WhyIWantHillary',&nbsp;'#HillarysArmy', or '#Hillary2016'); anti-Trump&nbsp;('#NeverTrump', '#dumptrump', '#trumptaxreturns',&nbsp;'#dontvotefortrump', '#dumpthetrump', '#boy-cotttrump', '#trumpsexism'); and pro-Trump ('#Im-WithYou', '#TrumpTrain', '#MakeAmericaGreatA-gain', '#TrumpPence16', '#TrumpPence2016',&nbsp;'#Trump', '#AltRight', '#VoteTrump', '#TeamTrump')&nbsp;This gave us approximately 600 user names for each&nbsp;of the four groups in our preliminary dataset. These&nbsp;user names were submitted to the EthosIO personality&nbsp;analyzer to produce distributional data for each subgroups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We therefore had in our preliminary corpus 651 pro-Clinton subjects, 587 pro-Trump subjects, 635&nbsp;anti-Clinton subjects and 639 anti-Trump subjects, for&nbsp;a total of 2512 total user names, divided across 16&nbsp;MBTI categories (details in full paper). As expected&nbsp;from previous work, the overall statistics do not match&nbsp;US demographics; for example, types ISFP and INFP&nbsp;are strongly overrepresented in all samples, as are introverts in general. Our interest, however, is in&nbsp;whether or not political differences also show up as&nbsp;personality differences as well. In plainer language,&nbsp;does the average Clinton supporter have a different&nbsp;personality than the average Trump supporter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We tested this hypothesis with a variety of chi-squared tests (df=15 throughout). At the most basic</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">level, we found extremely significant differences (p ~</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">10<sup>A</sup>-9) between Clinton supporters and Trump supporters. We also found significant differences (p ~ 10<sup>A</sup>-12) between &quot;Democrats&quot; (either pro-Clinton or&nbsp;anti-Trump) and &quot;Republicans&quot; (pro-Trump and antiClinton). Examining cells in detail suggest that ISFJ&nbsp;and ISFP are both overrepresented among Democrats&nbsp;while ESTJs and INFJs are overrepresented among Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By contrast, there was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.10) between &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Pro&quot; subjects, despite the&nbsp;possible participation, for example, of third party supporters who are opposed to both Trump and Clinton.&nbsp;Similarly, we found no significant difference between&nbsp;pro-Trump and anti-Clinton subjects, or between antiTrump and pro-Clinton subjects, suggesting that other&nbsp;factors than personality are affecting whether a person chooses to self-express in favor of a particular candidate or in opposition to that candidate's rival(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this study, there are a number of potential confounding factors, the effects of which have not yet been assessed. The first is simply the presence of active attempts to manipulate the dialogue, for example,&nbsp;through the use of automated 'bots' (Kollanyi, Howard,&nbsp;and Wolley, 2016), or simply through the use of &quot;sock&nbsp;puppets,&quot; multiple identities in an attempt to create a&nbsp;an appearance of consensus and of larger margins. A&nbsp;second factor is the issue of overlapping categories.&nbsp;Approximately 20% of our preliminary &quot;anti-Trump&quot;&nbsp;sample also self-identified as &quot;pro-Clinton,&quot; and similarly, approximately 20% of the anti-Clinton sample&nbsp;self-identified as pro-Trump. More counterintuitively, approximately 5% of the anti-Clinton sample&nbsp;also identified as anti-Trump, and approximately 5%&nbsp;of the pro-Clinton sample was also pro-Trump. This&nbsp;may be due to a third confounding factor, the inability&nbsp;of simple keyword spotting to identify the use of irony&nbsp;(for example, in posting a link to an article highly critical of Trump's campaign and using the '#Trump'&nbsp;hashtag to draw attention to it). As we continue this&nbsp;analysis, based in part on data to be collected during&nbsp;the final and most intense week of the campaign, we&nbsp;will address these issues (and discuss our methods of&nbsp;address in the final paper).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have therefore shown, using text analysis of Twitter on a moderately large scale, that there are significant differences between the types of people who&nbsp;self-identify as supporters (and opponents) of one of&nbsp;the major candidates in the 2016 US presidential election. We have also shown that there does not appear&nbsp;to be significant personality-related differences between whether one supports one's chosen candidate&nbsp;or opposes the other one. We have also confirmed the&nbsp;previous results (Juola, Vinsick, and Ryan, 2016) about&nbsp;the general distribution of personality types on Twitter, and hasten to point out that the differences we&nbsp;have identified are still relatively minor and that the&nbsp;overall distribution of personality types in both camps&nbsp;are broadly similar to the distribution of personality&nbsp;types on Twitter in general. However, our results&nbsp;show, first, that, in keeping with prior work, inferring&nbsp;personality type via Twitter is practical and useful. Second, they show that personality may play a factor in&nbsp;the selection of one's chosen candidate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Finally, the question of &quot;who are Trump's voters?&quot; against &quot;who are Clinton's voters?&quot; will no doubt interest historians for decades. Our results provide some&nbsp;insight into possible psychological motivations in addition to the more traditional social, political, and economics reasons, and may therefore enrich future discussion and scholarship.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Nota bene</span></h1>
