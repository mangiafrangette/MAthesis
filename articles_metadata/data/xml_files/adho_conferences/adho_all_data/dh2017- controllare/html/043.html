<p><span class="font3">The question of why Pablo Picasso dedicated a considerable amount of his time to writing around&nbsp;1935 is open to speculation. Many have cited the&nbsp;Spanish artist's emotional crisis, the political turmoil&nbsp;in Europe in the period between the two wars, and&nbsp;the menace of a fratricidal confrontation in Spain as&nbsp;possible causes. All of these views are predicated on&nbsp;an assumed irreducible conflict between visual composition and verbal expression. However, it should be&nbsp;considered that Picasso's interest in alternative&nbsp;methods of expression might have stemmed from his&nbsp;fascination with linguistic structure as a whole during&nbsp;his cubist period. To quote Marie-Laure Bernadac: “I&nbsp;am in complete agreement with [the] linguistics of&nbsp;cubism as a structural language. Picasso is very conscious of the ambivalence of language, the ambivalence of words ... Picasso always played with the ambivalence of words ... The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">papiers collés</span><span class="font3"> [may be&nbsp;thought of] as ‘proverbs'; that is, as things that take&nbsp;the place of the verb ‘to paint' ... The battle between&nbsp;word and image, between art and reality, between&nbsp;different systems of signs ... but one must never forget&nbsp;that Picasso's cubism is two things at once; it's painting and it's language ... His whole life he was obsessed&nbsp;with the relationship between painting and writing ...&nbsp;the battle between word and image, between art and&nbsp;reality” (Rubin et al., 1992). Many other authors have&nbsp;pointed out the parallel development of structural&nbsp;linguistics as delineated by Ferdinand de Saussure&nbsp;and the explorations of the different phases of cubism&nbsp;by Picasso, Braque and Gris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The connection between his writings and his plastic works has been explored by Cowling (2002), who refers to both his poems and his artworks as executed&nbsp;in a “spider's web” style: “A glance at the manuscripts&nbsp;reveals that he was attentive to the look and lay-out&nbsp;of the pages, relishing the dramatic impact of such&nbsp;things as variations in the size and style of the script,&nbsp;changes in the flow of ink or the thickness of the nib&nbsp;(and the color when he used crayons), contrasts between letters, numbers, dividing lines and the special&nbsp;punctuation marks he favored, different systems for&nbsp;crossing-out and large blots of ink. The calligraphy&nbsp;varies a good deal and is sometimes ornate and the&nbsp;effect handsome and arresting”. For a similar position, we may turn to Baldassari (Picasso and Baldas-sari, 2005), who poses a clear link between Picasso's&nbsp;visual works and his poetry: “In the decade between&nbsp;1925 and 1935 ... Picasso continued to pursue cursive&nbsp;linearity in canvases where poetic shapes and ideograms represented bathers and acrobats. The scrolling lines, bursting constellations, curving grids, and&nbsp;broad strokes that cross the surface of his pictorial&nbsp;work then found a new dimension in his poetic writing. Breton fully sensed its importance ... ‘This poetry&nbsp;is unfailingly visual in the same way that the painting&nbsp;is poetic'”. Earlier, Daix (Daix and Emmet, 1993) had</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">pointed out that “Picasso did not believe in spontaneous poetry - or painting. His attitude was that of a professional: someone who had put written fragments into his paintings and could certainly paint&nbsp;poems as well. The graphism of his letters and the&nbsp;way they were placed on a page were also a deliberate, visual creation”. Despite the close correlation between Picasso's poems and his artworks, one cannot&nbsp;deny that Picasso's poetry is essentially verbal, and&nbsp;not conditioned by plastic principles. This is precisely&nbsp;what makes Picasso's poetry so interesting: it provides a window into Picasso's mind that is separate&nbsp;from his own artistic creations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our research has taken us through different approaches in order to analyze Picasso's artistic legacy (Meneses et al., 2008a, Meneses et al., 2011) and his&nbsp;poetry. In our study of Picasso's writings, we first&nbsp;created a concordance of all of his poems and plays,&nbsp;separating the poems by language (Spanish and&nbsp;French) (Meneses et al., 2008b). We then designed a&nbsp;dictionary based on this bilingual concordance of poems that was dynamically generated, identifying the&nbsp;stanzas and lines of each poem. A third step led us to&nbsp;provide an English translation to every French and&nbsp;Spanish term, which allowed us to reduce the number&nbsp;of concepts that Picasso works with. This reduction&nbsp;improved clarity for two reasons: First, we eliminated&nbsp;the language distinction (Spanish vs. French); and&nbsp;second, because we merged morphological variation&nbsp;into single units, so that tense/mood alterations for&nbsp;verbs, and gender/number differences for the noun,&nbsp;for instance, were bypassed. As a result, we ended up&nbsp;with three lexical lists: one for Spanish terms, one for&nbsp;French terms, and one with English translations that&nbsp;links the first two lists. The third lexical list may be&nbsp;considered a semantic dictionary specifying concrete&nbsp;concepts in Picasso's writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, we felt that some aspects of Picasso's poetry needed further exploration. In this paper we&nbsp;propose to explore the possibility that Picasso's transition into poetry is simply one more manifestation of&nbsp;his pursuit of alternative approaches to language as a&nbsp;means of representation. In this sense, one thing that&nbsp;remained to be determined was how concrete concepts in both languages cluster into representative&nbsp;semantic categories; and how these categories interact with each other in semantic networks. For this&nbsp;purpose, we have expanded upon our previous efforts by using statistical models and algorithms. More&nbsp;specifically, we have used Latent Dirchlet Allocation:&nbsp;a hierarchical probabilistic generative model that can&nbsp;be used to represent a collection of documents by&nbsp;topics (Blei et al., 2003) to analyze Picasso's poetry.&nbsp;Our analysis demonstrates that topic modeling can&nbsp;highlight patterns and trends in Picasso's poetry that&nbsp;escape other forms of traditional analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We will elaborate on the details of our current analysis using three points. First, it is safe to assume&nbsp;that all poets limit themselves to a number of representational topics as they compose their poems. We&nbsp;know that the European conflict, the crisis in Picasso's own personal relations and the immediate objects in his surroundings constituted the backdrop of&nbsp;many of his compositions. In this respect, topic modeling has allowed us to more precisely delimit the&nbsp;lexical manifestation of these themes, enabling us to&nbsp;see interrelations between words within particular&nbsp;topics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Secondly, topic modeling has allowed us to see correlations between concrete themes as identified&nbsp;by certain lexical terms and different languages. These correlations are particularly interesting in the case</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of a bilingual poet like Picasso. For example, psychological concepts-madness, for example- are often handled in French; while more physical references to&nbsp;his immediate surroundings are circumscribed to&nbsp;Spanish terms. However, in cases where both languages are used to communicate a similar concept,&nbsp;Picasso chooses Spanish when he intends to apply a&nbsp;more folkloric tone. Using the English lexical list of&nbsp;terms, we were able to highlight and identify the interconnections between his poems in different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, we have determined that, in Picasso's poems, certain semantic domains are predominant in each of the two languages he used - Spanish and&nbsp;French. For instance, Picasso is more inclined to refer&nbsp;to food items and everyday objects in his Spanish poems, which thus provides a clear reflection of his&nbsp;physical environment and of the harsh economic situation of this time. On the other hand, his French poems concentrate on more abstract concepts involving&nbsp;politics, religion and sexuality, which may be attributed to the influence of French Surrealist writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To summarize, in this paper we propose to analyze the ways in which concepts in Picasso's poems and plays cluster into semantic categories; and in&nbsp;turn, how these categories interact with other concepts within a complex semantic network. Furthermore, through the use of statistical models we have&nbsp;been able to identify and pinpoint representative&nbsp;themes and correlations across different languages.&nbsp;Although topic modeling can point us to patterns and&nbsp;interconnections within Picasso's writings, accurately&nbsp;characterizing the nature of these relationships remains a challenge.</span></p>
