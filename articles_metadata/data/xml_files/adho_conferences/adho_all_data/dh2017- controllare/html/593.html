<p><span class="font1">Emerging from the crucible of the religious upheaval that characterizes the English Renaissance is arguably the most influential English book ever&nbsp;printed in terms of its impact on Anglophone religious,&nbsp;literary, popular, and legal culture: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Common Prayer</span><span class="font1"> (BCP). Encoded within its pages is a kind&nbsp;of algorithm, an annually recurring process, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ritual-ization</span><span class="font1"> of both private devotion and public worship for&nbsp;generations of post-Reformation English readers. Taking our cue from Brad Pasanek (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Metaphors of Mind: An&nbsp;Eighteenth-Century Dictionary</span><span class="font1">, 2015) and Peter Stally-brass (“Against Thinking.” PMLA, Vol. 122, No. 5), both&nbsp;of whom have drawn useful analogies between the database and the commonplace book, we employ the creative anachronism of the “Bible app” to describe the&nbsp;function of the BCP in early modern England. As the&nbsp;first such “app” of its kind, the BCP choreographed religious meaning and ritualized worship for a whole&nbsp;generation of English Bible readers, shaping them into&nbsp;religio-political subjects who were then able to situate&nbsp;their lived experiences within a communally shared&nbsp;time and space. From the perspective of the Early&nbsp;Modern layperson, the BCP provides mediated access&nbsp;to the newly translated biblical text. Of course, from&nbsp;the abstracted perspective of the nascent nation-state&nbsp;of England, the BCP functions as a way to mitigate new&nbsp;anxieties surrounding the democratization of sacred&nbsp;scripture. As the legally established, official means by&nbsp;which sacred text is encountered, the BCP is nothing&nbsp;less than a masterpiece of social engineering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To extend the metaphor of text as program, the BCP can also be thought of as a class, one which can be inherited and sub-classed, instantiated and “hacked” according to the agenda of particular readers who would&nbsp;produce, via their nuanced reading of BCP ritual,&nbsp;slightly different kinds of subjects according to the&nbsp;specific context in which they find themselves. Of particular interest to the project at hand is a 1586 BCP&nbsp;which has been highly “sub-classed” by one of its owners. Bound together with the prayer book is an entire&nbsp;psalter, whose collection of 150 psalms is cross-referenced in a single hand, which also makes occasional&nbsp;thematic/tonal annotations. In our examination of this&nbsp;prayer book, we wish to develop a methodology for accessing the kind of subject such a “re-engineered” BCP&nbsp;might have produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Implied in the very notion of access, of course, is mediation. Within the limited scope of our project, we&nbsp;do not have recourse to the intense amount of labor&nbsp;required to perform a rigorous exegesis of the entire&nbsp;psalter according to how its 16<sup>th</sup>-century readers&nbsp;might have read it. What we do have, via the psalter's&nbsp;marginalia, is what one (or perhaps two) reader(s) selected as noteworthy in their BCP-regulated practice&nbsp;of reading the Psalms. We also have our own attempts&nbsp;to thematize and register the tone of those same texts.&nbsp;Given these assets, we attempt to provide via the Psalter Project a representation of how a subject produced&nbsp;by this prayer book might look </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">from our perspective</span><span class="font1">.&nbsp;Our hope is that, despite the inherently mediated nature of such a representation, we might provide students and scholars alike a better understanding of the&nbsp;“programmatic” nature of religious para-texts like&nbsp;the BCP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Psalter Project was born out of Dr. Nandra Perry's scholarship in Early Modern English literature&nbsp;in partnership with Bryan Tarpley's work as Lead Software Applications Developer for the Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture (IDHMC) at Texas&nbsp;A&amp;M University. Perry's work with the 1586 prayer&nbsp;book led her to apply for a Summer Technical Assistance Grant with the IDHMC, at which point she was&nbsp;awarded some of Tarpley's development time. Together, they (we) designed a relational database&nbsp;schema for recording the cross-references and tags&nbsp;found in the 1586 prayer book, as well as a web-interface for entering and viewing them. A </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">beta version of&nbsp;the project</span><span class="font1"> is available for viewing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before commencing development on the Psalter Project web app, a survey of extant, web-based tools&nbsp;was performed to determine whether any one tool (or&nbsp;collection of tools) already satisfied our requirements.&nbsp;Given the marginalia we have to work with (a large&nbsp;amount of scriptural cross-references and thematic</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tags), we wanted a tool to facilitate the capture and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">that they too might be able to provide (mediated) access to religio-political subjects.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">analysis of this data. While there are indeed several</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">digital annotation tools available, such as MIT’s </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Annotation Studio</span><span class="font1">, or the University of Virginia’s </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">PRISM</span><span class="font1">, none of these tools allow for the rapid entry of scriptural verse range references and tags. Tarpley implemented the database schema by creating a MySQL database and wrote the web application in Python using&nbsp;the Django web framework, as well as other web-related technologies, such as the jQuery Javascript library and the Bootstrap CSS framework. The database&nbsp;and web app are both hosted by the IDHMC’s server&nbsp;infrastructure at Texas A&amp;M. As a way of beta-testing&nbsp;the app, Perry then recorded a sampling of the psalter’s cross-references and tags, and also included her&nbsp;own tagging of the referenced verses in terms of both&nbsp;thematic content and perceived emotional impact (affect).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the Psalter Project in still in development both in terms of methodology and finished product, a&nbsp;preliminary sketch of our reader is emerging via the&nbsp;various views made available through the web app.&nbsp;There is a visualization of the thematic and affective&nbsp;tags in the form of tag-clouds weighted by frequency,&nbsp;a view of the most frequently referenced verses along&nbsp;with their tags, a break-down of all referenced verses&nbsp;(and associated tags) by any specific thematic or affective tag, a presentation of the network of referenced&nbsp;verses (and associated tags) by any specific verse, and&nbsp;a presentation of any of the 150 Psalms in its entirety&nbsp;where referenced verses can be hovered over, displaying tags and referenced verses. At this initial stage, we&nbsp;believe that this multi-faceted portrayal is revealing a&nbsp;reader with a profound sense of group identity as the&nbsp;loyal subject of a just God who provides deliverance to&nbsp;the deserving and punishment to “bad” subjects and&nbsp;oppressive outsiders. The effect, it would seem, is the&nbsp;sacralization of a religio-politics in which the reader’s&nbsp;relationship to God is analogous to his/her relationship to the nation-state (and vice versa), thereby justifying, in turn, a posture of hostility toward outsiders&nbsp;and “bad” subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this paper, we intend to not only provide a more fully fleshed-out representation of the Early&nbsp;Modern religio-political English subject, but to interrogate the various assumptions and methodologies we&nbsp;use to provide this representation so that we might&nbsp;improve the Psalter Project web application. We hope&nbsp;to be able to provide this web application (both in&nbsp;terms of an open- source repository and as an IDHMC&nbsp;hosted web service) to other scholars in the future, so</span></p>
