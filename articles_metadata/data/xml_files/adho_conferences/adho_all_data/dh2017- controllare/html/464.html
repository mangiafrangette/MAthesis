<p><span class="font3">In this paper, the authors introduce a new research collaboration between the Institute for Linguistic&nbsp;Studies (St. Petersburg, Russia) and the Austrian&nbsp;Academy of Sciences, Austrian Centre for Digital&nbsp;Humanities (Vienna, Austria), and exemplify&nbsp;multicultural, crossdisciplinary collaboration on the&nbsp;Ph.D project of Russian manuscript lexicons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The project is aimed at the online representation of the Russian manuscript lexicons, which reflect a very&nbsp;important stage in Russian lexicography and served as&nbsp;a basis for the printed dictionaries appeared later. This&nbsp;lexicographical genre (called azbukovnik in Russian)&nbsp;appeared in the middle of the 16th century on the base&nbsp;of glossaries, and differ from them by the alphabetical&nbsp;order of the word entries. About 150 manuscripts,&nbsp;mostly from the 17th century, containing the lexicons&nbsp;came into our hands. The tradition of copying&nbsp;manuscript lexicons preserved in the Old Believers&nbsp;communities, and the latest lexicon dates from the&nbsp;beginning of the 20th century. Lexicons were&nbsp;classified by L.S.Kovtun in the 1989, and some&nbsp;additions were made later by K.I.Kovalenko (for&nbsp;details see Kovalenko, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Obligatory parts of the word entries were head word (or collocation) and explanation. Word entries&nbsp;could also contain inscription of the language source&nbsp;for loan words, lexicographical or literary sources,&nbsp;citations, and information about topic groups&nbsp;(animals, birds, plants, etc.). Sometimes, observations&nbsp;on various linguistic topics were included in the word&nbsp;entries as well. Despite the great importance of these&nbsp;lexicons as Russian language history resources, only&nbsp;small part of them is available for researchers (2&nbsp;published in Kovtun, 1975 and 1989, and 16 can be&nbsp;found </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">online</span><span class="font3"> as a facsimile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The research idea is formulated collaboratively by the Russian and Austrian scholars, experienced in&nbsp;(traditional) lexicography as well as in digital&nbsp;transformation and research infrastructure&nbsp;development. An architecture to embed the Russian&nbsp;manuscript lexicons into a larger lexical resources&nbsp;infrastructure is developed based on these visions and&nbsp;needs at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;Cornerstones of the architecture are opening up&nbsp;lexical resources and develop as much as possible (due&nbsp;to different types of licensing) freely available&nbsp;resources to the broader public which meet the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">open&nbsp;science definition</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The established architecture consists of three layers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The human interface layer: </span><span class="font3">supports&nbsp;data access e.g. list of headwords,&nbsp;geographical map, timeline and other&nbsp;visual approaches etc., which is further&nbsp;developed with every new project.&nbsp;Furthermore, via authentification it offers&nbsp;a private workspace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The persistent layer: </span><span class="font3">offers a data&nbsp;repository, e.g. triple store, open access&nbsp;repository to sustainable store and&nbsp;interlink data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The enrichment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer</span><span class="font3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">opportunities and tools to interlink data and collaboratively enrich data, e.g. with&nbsp;Wikidata or Europeana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ideally, all Russian manuscript lexicons in text format and as facsimiles should be included in the&nbsp;research data environment. As a first step, main&nbsp;representatives of each lexicon type are represented.&nbsp;The plain text is marked up in TEI and is provided with&nbsp;metadata which include standardised form of the head&nbsp;word, information about its origin, foreign etymon for&nbsp;loan words (such as anouToAog for anocrojit) and&nbsp;topic group designation. Word entries contain&nbsp;metadata about lexicographical or literary sources. In&nbsp;case that the facsimile is available, it will be presented&nbsp;along with the text form of the lexicon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The project is aimed, on one hand, at the representation of the most important lexicons in&nbsp;marked up textual form and as facsimile (if possible).&nbsp;On other hand, the search engine embedded in the&nbsp;infrastructure will make it possible to create enquiries&nbsp;to the data and make selections such as: words&nbsp;according to their origin, literary or lexicographical</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sources, words belonging to a particular topic groups and so on. The manuscripts will be semantically&nbsp;exploited and concept-based, interlinked with&nbsp;knowledge resources in the linked open data&nbsp;framework (for more details see Kovalenko et al.,&nbsp;2016). For example, interlinking with Europeana will&nbsp;increase the accessibility and reusability of the data.&nbsp;Thus, the project will make Russian lexicons available&nbsp;and open them for further research and for public&nbsp;curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The poster will introduce the collaborative approach, the roles of the partners and their&nbsp;contributions, discuss the technical framework based&nbsp;on the research approach and present recent results&nbsp;the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The project is connected to the COST action IS 1305 European Network of electronic Lexicography (ENeL).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgements</span></h2>
