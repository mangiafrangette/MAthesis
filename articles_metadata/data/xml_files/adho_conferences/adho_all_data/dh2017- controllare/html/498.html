<p><span class="font5">When access as a value of scholarship is foregrounded in publishing, libraries emerge as&nbsp;“natural and efficient loci for scholarly publication”&nbsp;(Courant and Jones, 2015). In a rapidly evolving digital&nbsp;publishing landscape, academic libraries are poised to&nbsp;address scholars’ publishing concerns about gaining&nbsp;access to opportunities for support and re-skilling,&nbsp;providing open access to their intellectual content, and&nbsp;ensuring access to the audiences who will most benefit&nbsp;from their work. The growth of library-based&nbsp;publishing services is evidenced by the 115 college&nbsp;and university libraries currently listed in the Library&nbsp;Publishing Directory (Lippincott, 2016). This paper&nbsp;presents selected results from a US-based survey on&nbsp;the needs of humanities scholars in a contemporary&nbsp;publishing environment, emphasizing aspects of the&nbsp;survey responses that shed light on the question of&nbsp;access in publishing from three perspectives: access to&nbsp;support services, access to content, and access to&nbsp;audience.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">About PWW</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Publishing Without Walls (PWW) is a Mellon-funded initiative at the University of Illinois led by the University Library in partnership with the School of&nbsp;Information Sciences, the department of African&nbsp;American Studies, and the Illinois Program for&nbsp;Research in the Humanities. Our project is developing&nbsp;an innovative and experimental library-based digital&nbsp;scholarly publishing model that aims to be accessible,&nbsp;scalable, and sustainable. Our objective is to develop&nbsp;a model for library-based publishing services that can&nbsp;be adopted broadly by other academic libraries to&nbsp;address scholars’ emerging needs in a contemporary&nbsp;publishing environment. The model itself places&nbsp;humanities scholar at the center of the ecosystem,&nbsp;with services informed by—and responsive to—&nbsp;scholars’ needs. Research and development within the&nbsp;project are strategically designed to address known&nbsp;gaps within the current landscape: the gap between&nbsp;what and how scholars want to publish and what&nbsp;existing systems of print publishing can&nbsp;accommodate; the gap between the everyday&nbsp;practices of humanities scholars and what high-level&nbsp;tools exist for producing and supporting digital&nbsp;scholarship; and the gap between digital scholarship&nbsp;and publishing opportunities at resource-rich&nbsp;institutions and Historically Black Colleges and&nbsp;Universities (HBCUs).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Survey Method</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">This paper presents the selected results of a largescale survey about scholars’ publishing practices and perceived needs. The full survey aims to understand&nbsp;what and how scholars want to publish, when and why&nbsp;they choose to publish digitally, and how they perceive&nbsp;the success of their digital publications. Survey&nbsp;outcomes will directly inform the development of&nbsp;PWW’s shareable service model, but we also anticipate&nbsp;that our survey results will be relevant to digital&nbsp;humanists and other scholars engaged in digital&nbsp;scholarly publishing, whether such efforts are located&nbsp;within or beyond an academic library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From June to October 2016, we conducted a largescale survey of scholars, especially targeted at humanities scholars and scholars at HBCUs in the&nbsp;United States. The survey was developed by the PWW&nbsp;Research Team in spring 2016, and comprised around&nbsp;30 questions. The survey covers six broad themes:&nbsp;respondents’ experiences with print and digital&nbsp;publishing; respondents’ publishing objectives;&nbsp;publishing tools and platforms; publishing services&nbsp;and support; publishing from the scholars’ perspective&nbsp;of reader as opposed to author; and general attitudes&nbsp;toward print and digital publishing. The survey was&nbsp;distributed through listservs and social media venues&nbsp;targeting scholars in the humanities generally as well&nbsp;as selected niche communities to encourage sufficient&nbsp;responses across disciplines and institutions. The&nbsp;survey received 250 responses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The team used the Qualtrics platform to present the survey and conduct initial analysis, with further&nbsp;quantitative data analysis in SPSS. Preliminary&nbsp;findings have been reported previously (Fenlon et al.,&nbsp;2016), and analysis is ongoing. The survey instrument&nbsp;and a summary report will also be archived in the&nbsp;IDEALS repository (Velez et al., in preparation).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respondents were asked to identify which aspects of publishing posed the most significant challenges&nbsp;with respect to their experiences with print and digital&nbsp;content. Figure 1 represents the percentage of&nbsp;respondents who indicated each potential issue as&nbsp;either “quite challenging” or “extremely challenging”&nbsp;in print or digital publishing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Figure 1. Top Challenges for Print and Digital Publishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The top three challenges for digital publishing include getting adequate technical, editorial, and financial&nbsp;support for publication. Respondents were also asked&nbsp;to indicate and rank their top five publishing goals,&nbsp;which are illustrated in Figure 2 as a weighted bar&nbsp;graph where a first-place ranking is assigned 10&nbsp;points, a second-place ranking is assigned 5 points,&nbsp;and a third-place ranking is assigned 1 point. The top&nbsp;three goals are consistent with the traditional&nbsp;expectations for scholarly publishing: contributing&nbsp;new information to one’s field, encouraging and&nbsp;participating in dialogue about an area of study, and&nbsp;establishing a formal record of one’s scholarship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Figure 2. Primary Goals for Publishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Figure 3 illustrates the top three audiences that scholars indicated they most wish to reach. The top&nbsp;two audiences relate to peers within the academic&nbsp;community. While interest in reaching the general&nbsp;educated reader and students is less frequently cited,&nbsp;it is sufficiently robust to consider how reaching these&nbsp;audiences may have an impact on scholars’ decision&nbsp;making with regard to the medium they choose and&nbsp;the venues they seek for publication. Understanding&nbsp;how less traditional, but still prevalent, publishing&nbsp;goals affect these choices is also a potentially fruitful&nbsp;avenue for exploring how explicitly stated publishing&nbsp;objectives inform, and possibly shift, priorities&nbsp;regarding representation and dissemination within&nbsp;scholarly publishing. These themes are explored in a&nbsp;set of four charts in Figure 4.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">Figure 4. Comparing Scholars Selection Criteria for Publishing Medium and Venue in Relation to Target&nbsp;Audience and Publishing Goals</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Discussion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">When comparing scholars’ characterization of challenges in digital versus print publishing, speed to&nbsp;publication and reaching one’s intended audience&nbsp;emerge as the two greatest challenges to print&nbsp;publication, but they are perceived as relatively less&nbsp;challenging in digital formats. This difference between&nbsp;print and digital suggests that these “challenges”&nbsp;might be considered the primary “affordances” that&nbsp;scholars perceive for digital publishing. For digital&nbsp;publishing, the top three challenges that scholars face&nbsp;all relate to receiving adequate support for the&nbsp;logistical aspects of the process, including technical,&nbsp;editorial, and financial support. Though not one of the&nbsp;top three challenges, another aspect of publication&nbsp;that the survey responses suggest is more challenging&nbsp;in digital than print publication is manuscript&nbsp;preparation. Despite the fact that the most prevalent&nbsp;challenges to digital publishing relate to issues of&nbsp;support, the support that scholars will receive from&nbsp;publishers never emerges as a major factor in a&nbsp;scholar’s choice of publishing medium or venue,&nbsp;regardless of their specific publication goals and&nbsp;intended audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The top three considerations with respect to choosing both one’s medium and the venue in which&nbsp;to publish are the ability to effectively represent the&nbsp;scholarship, the ability to reach one’s target audience,&nbsp;and the reputation or prestige of the venue or medium.&nbsp;The weight of these and remaining factors, however,&nbsp;shifts when analyzed in conjunction with scholar’s&nbsp;goals and target audiences, suggesting opportunities&nbsp;for developing more nuanced consultative support&nbsp;services when selecting tools and platforms in light of&nbsp;scholars’ goals and intended audience. For digital&nbsp;publishing, the first two considerations&nbsp;(representation and audience) are likely to be the&nbsp;determining factor in a scholar’s decision to shift away&nbsp;from traditional print publishing and to consider&nbsp;library-based digital publishing opportunities. The&nbsp;emphasis on reputation and prestige, however, may&nbsp;prove problematic for fledgling initiatives that seek to&nbsp;develop alternatives to the established publication&nbsp;models of university presses. Further research will&nbsp;investigate what constitutes acceptable markers of&nbsp;prestige to determine the importance of affiliation&nbsp;with an institution of higher education, which libraries&nbsp;already have, or affiliation with known university&nbsp;presses, which most libraries do not have.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Compared to other publishing models, situating support for scholarly communication in the research&nbsp;library creates possibilities for addressing challenges&nbsp;related to access and sustainability of digital scholarly&nbsp;publishing. This support can be performed efficiently&nbsp;as a part of library activities, leveraging pre-existing&nbsp;technical infrastructure that is designed to support&nbsp;discovery and preservation as well as digital&nbsp;scholarships programs within scholars’ commons.&nbsp;These aspects of library-based publishing prove&nbsp;especially compelling in light of survey findings that&nbsp;the biggest challenges for digital publishing include&nbsp;securing adequate technical support services, in&nbsp;addition to financial and editorial support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Publishing Without Walls initiative is seeking to offer attractive solutions for authors 1) whose&nbsp;scholarship is not sufficiently represented in the print&nbsp;medium and 2) who place a high value on the&nbsp;technological affordances provided by open access&nbsp;digital scholarship to reach their intended audiences.&nbsp;We further anticipate that developing value-added&nbsp;support services in the form of individual&nbsp;consultations and incubation workshops will help&nbsp;ease the support-related challenges cited by scholars,&nbsp;particularly when assessing which platforms and tools&nbsp;will best represent an author’s scholarship.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
