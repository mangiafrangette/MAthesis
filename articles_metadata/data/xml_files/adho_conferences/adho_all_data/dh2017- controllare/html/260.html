<p><span class="font1">Cognitive games involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition, while&nbsp;proposing the intersection between the sets of&nbsp;concepts, fun and cognition, for the improvement of&nbsp;cognitive functions. The attention is the main point&nbsp;made in this study, since it is fundamental to the&nbsp;learning process and be recurring complaint among&nbsp;parents and teachers in schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes, researchers&nbsp;suggest that regular practice has a significant&nbsp;influence on improving the performance related to&nbsp;basic visual skills (Li, Polat, Scalzo, &amp; Bavelier, 2010);&nbsp;on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously (Dye&nbsp;&amp; Bavelier, 2010; Feng, Spence, &amp; Pratt, 2007); and on&nbsp;the ability to do more than one task at the same time&nbsp;(Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, &amp; Gratton, 2008).&nbsp;Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital&nbsp;games in the school context and suggest potential for&nbsp;digital game use to improve of student's attention span&nbsp;at preschool age (Rueda, Checa, &amp; Combita, 2012), to&nbsp;improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary&nbsp;school children (Miller &amp; Robertson, 2010), and to&nbsp;better performance of working memory ability&nbsp;(Klingberg et al., 2005; Thorell, Lindqvist, Nutley,&nbsp;Bohlin, &amp; Klingberg, 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention, because of its involvement in&nbsp;the regulation of thoughts and emotions, maintaining&nbsp;the performance of this process is very important,&nbsp;especially in school, where the child must acquire&nbsp;content in an environment full of countless distractors.&nbsp;The study in question focuses on the attention,&nbsp;proposing and evaluation in the context of the&nbsp;classroom. Thus, it suggests the use of digital games in&nbsp;an integrated way the school activities in the&nbsp;classroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The games have features like increasing challenges, rules that establish what can and cannot be done, and&nbsp;involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills&nbsp;and win the game (Kirriemuir &amp; McFarlane, 2004;&nbsp;Prensky, 2006).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a&nbsp;database, of the Escola do Cerebro, for monitoring and&nbsp;improvement of cognitive skills, highlighting the&nbsp;attention. The games involve challenges and rules&nbsp;involving the exercise of cognitive functions,&nbsp;especially the working memory, attention and&nbsp;capacity of solving problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. It collects the data based on the&nbsp;observation of the proposed interventions as well as&nbsp;interviews conducted with participating teachers and&nbsp;students to identify their perceptions of digital games’&nbsp;contributions to the learning process. Furthermore,&nbsp;before and after the implementation of the&nbsp;intervention, we performed a D2 Test of attention that&nbsp;measures selective and sustained attention, as well as&nbsp;visual scanning accuracy and speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The intervention consisted in the use of the Escola do Cerebro, using tablets in the classroom, daily for a&nbsp;period of five weeks. The sample consisted of 71&nbsp;students of the Application School of Basic Education,&nbsp;Federal University of Santa Catarina, aged 7 and 9&nbsp;years old (M = 7.64 ± 1.12), which were divided into&nbsp;two groups: participant and control. The first (n = 31)&nbsp;participated in the intervention, the control group (n =&nbsp;40) was only evaluated using the test before and after&nbsp;the same time interval of interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Escola do Cerebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database. The application&nbsp;allows visualization of the player's performance and&nbsp;offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers.&nbsp;Students have their scores measured by four&nbsp;variables: time, speed, stability and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A statistical analysis was performed based on the application of the paired t-test on the difference of the&nbsp;overall score obtained in the test before and after the&nbsp;intervention in the two groups. The difference in the&nbsp;results obtained from the application of D2 Test of&nbsp;attention before and after was statistically significant&nbsp;(p &lt;0.05), the participant group had mean and&nbsp;standard deviation 60.23 (64.75) respectively, while&nbsp;the control group was 20.00 (42.65).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The result indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test, as&nbsp;well as a high dispersion, which reveals a variation in&nbsp;relation to the performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition, students participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem&nbsp;solving, recognize the need to plan actions in relation&nbsp;to their importance for the game and for daily&nbsp;activities, and realize improvements in the ability to&nbsp;sustain attention. The teachers observed changes after&nbsp;the intervention, emphasizing the greater persistence&nbsp;and involvement in school activities, and in some&nbsp;students, improvement in the ability to sustain&nbsp;attention. From this, we conclude that an intervention&nbsp;based on cognitive digital games offers contributions&nbsp;to the learning process and improvement of sustained&nbsp;attention.</span></p>
