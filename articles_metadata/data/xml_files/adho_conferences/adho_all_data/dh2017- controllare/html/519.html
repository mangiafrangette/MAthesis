<p><span class="font4">This poster describes one preliminary aspect of a new project about the history of beer and brewing in&nbsp;London. I am building a prosopography of brewers'&nbsp;apprentices in the years from about 1530 to approximately 1800. A catalogue of apprentices and their&nbsp;masters can teach us not only about the social and cultural history of British beer during that time but about&nbsp;the social network of people working in the industry.&nbsp;During this 270-year period, the Worshipful Company&nbsp;of Brewers, the medieval brewing guild first established by Henry VI in 1438, logged nearly 10,000 apprenticeship records (Webb), a collection that serves&nbsp;as just one of many potential datasets that can yield insights into England's brewing culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Th</span><span class="font4">e more immediate goal described in this poster, then, is how to parse these 10,000 records into component parts— people, places, occupations, and&nbsp;dates—so that these relationships can be analyzed and&nbsp;mapped over time. A typical apprenticeship record</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AMBROSE John s John, JlsLey, I3rk, xn^JX§i6Tto Samuel May 14 Jul 1703</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In other words: John Ambrose, whose father is John Ambrose from Ilsley, Berkshire and is a maltster by&nbsp;profession, was apprenticed to Samuel May and the fee&nbsp;was paid on 14 July 1703. </span><span class="font1">Th</span><span class="font4">e record lists three people, a parish, a county, a profession, and a date—a typical dataset found when tracking apprenticeships&nbsp;(Lane).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The simplicity and regularity of that template tantalizingly suggests writing an automated parser, which I am doing with an open source Python module called&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pyparsing</span><span class="font4">. Although these recursive descent parsers,&nbsp;as they are called, are designed for more elaborate&nbsp;projects (like writing compilers), they are the perfect&nbsp;tool for a job like this because they allow users to construct grammatical “rules” that look like simple additions. For example, the record above can be parsed according a grammatical rule that looks like simple Python:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">apprentice + father + location + occupation + to + master + date</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the wide variety of apprenticeship records presents a challenge. As it turns out, the first 10% of the apprenticeship records require nearly 40 di</span><span class="font0">ff</span><span class="font4">erent</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">template “grammars.” The effectiveness of an automated parsing approach—useful but nonetheless somewhat limited—is the main point of the poster.&nbsp;Supplementary strategies (like natural entity parsing&nbsp;and dictionary lookups) may provide some help and, if&nbsp;they prove themselves worthy, they will become part&nbsp;of the presentation as well.</span></p>
