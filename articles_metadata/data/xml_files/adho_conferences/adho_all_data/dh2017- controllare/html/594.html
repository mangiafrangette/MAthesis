<p><span class="font3">This poster presents recent work in the visualization of literary correspondence from the TCLLP (Twentieth-Century Literary Letters Project), focusing&nbsp;on the comparative visualization and analysis of digital editions of letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How might we begin to compare the collected correspondences of letter-writers? As archival letters are increasingly digitized, either by libraries and special&nbsp;collection or by the large-scale digital correspondence&nbsp;projects now emerging (e.g. the Electronic Enlightenment project, Early Modern Letters Online), we now&nbsp;have the opportunity to investigate authorial correspondence at larger scales. Beyond the usual use of&nbsp;correspondence to fill out the historical or biographical background of a writer, or to provide thematic and&nbsp;social points of linkage between writers, large collections of digital letters allow us to pose a range of new&nbsp;questions and problems: what does the social network&nbsp;of highly interconnected writers look like? What sorts&nbsp;of visual arguments and tools are appropriate to inquire into literary correspondence? How do the forces&nbsp;of class, gender, status, politics and profession manifest in a large correspondence? How do we read the&nbsp;gaps, cracks, elisions, and unseen limitations inherent&nbsp;both in our archival evidence and our digital tools?&nbsp;What are the large-scale shifts in epistolary culture&nbsp;over time, and how might we better understand those&nbsp;shifts in the correspondence of particular writers? To&nbsp;think through those questions more concretely, we&nbsp;visualized and compared the metadata of two well-curated digital correspondences from the early nineteenth and early twentieth century, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Collected Letters of Robert Southey</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A Calendar of the Letters of&nbsp;Willa Cather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We worked with the editors of these letters, and experts in TEI and RDF metadata transformation, to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">move the relationship implied by letter metadata - information about personal, political, geographical, and editorial networks of these very different writers -into visual representation. Our work forms part of an&nbsp;ongoing effort to bridge the gap between the Textual&nbsp;Encoding Initiative community, open linked data initiatives, and wider scholarly, library, and public audiences, as well as investigating important issues in data&nbsp;visualization as a hermeneutic activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This poster session presents our refined visualizations of these materials, and includes procedural as well as literary-critical findings: we will outline the&nbsp;process by which we move from TEI or less structured&nbsp;correspondence data into graph and network visualization; note some of interpretive and archival issues&nbsp;involved in that transformation; and display the refined visualizations comparing the political, personal,&nbsp;and literary networks of Southey and Cather. We hope&nbsp;to have an interactive conversation with attendees interested in network visualization, literary correspondence, Romanticism and modernism, open linked data,&nbsp;and the new TEI standards for correspondence data.&nbsp;The TCLLP is an open group of scholars interested in&nbsp;new approaches to twentieth-century literary correspondence, across linguistic, national, and disciplinary&nbsp;divides: we look forward to a discussion with Francophone scholars in particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Initial visualizations will be available on the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">project</span></p><img src="594_files/594-1.jpg" style="width:216pt;height:216pt;"/>
