<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paper will take my ongoing doctoral research designing resources for analysing individual graphic&nbsp;novels as a case study and starting point to discuss&nbsp;how we can produce data in the Humanities which can&nbsp;be called ‘feminist’. It will engage with the significant&nbsp;debates on this topic which are emerging in the Digital&nbsp;Humanities (Clement, 2016) (Drucker, 2012) (Losh et&nbsp;al., 2016) (Posner, 2016) (Rhody, 2016), particularly&nbsp;the panel discussion on creating feminist&nbsp;infrastructure at DH 2016 (Brown et al., 2016).&nbsp;Marking up images and designing ways in which to&nbsp;make them communicate with a comic’s words are&nbsp;highly subjective enterprises. By explaining how I&nbsp;dealt with this issue in my research, this paper will&nbsp;outline how the subjectivity involved in creating our&nbsp;own data structures and ontologies, and these&nbsp;elements’ inherent statuses as arguments about data,&nbsp;is a strength, an affordance, of such an approach, as&nbsp;well as something that embraces the situatedness and&nbsp;plurality of data that feminists in the sciences&nbsp;(Haraway, 1988) (Irigaray, 1985) have advocated for&nbsp;and which, more recently, have been advocated for in&nbsp;the Digital Humanities. Although my case study&nbsp;focuses on contemporary comics, this paper will&nbsp;explain how some of the resulting principles can be&nbsp;employed by data creators today in other disciplines&nbsp;and the GLAM sector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Background and method</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a Digital Humanist operating outside of a specific department or centre, the question that I hear&nbsp;most often about my work is how I make the resources&nbsp;which I create objective, how I avoid my datasets&nbsp;merely reflecting one individual’s interpretation of a&nbsp;text. But when I mark up an image in a certain way, or&nbsp;use a database structure to reflect the rhizomatic&nbsp;structure of a graphic novel, I do so not because it is&nbsp;‘appropriate’ or a ‘good fit’, but because that is an&nbsp;argument I want to make about comics and their&nbsp;meaning mechanism, and by applying that algorithm&nbsp;to the dataset that is the comic, I articulate that&nbsp;argument, mobilising it and making it available for&nbsp;evaluation. I am not trying to enact as little violence as&nbsp;possible to a text; I am making an argument about it.&nbsp;This idea that datasets, data structures and algorithms&nbsp;are arguments that are made about texts or other&nbsp;objects of study is relatively well-established in Digital&nbsp;Humanities (Ramsay and Rockwell, 2012) but it is&nbsp;more often framed as a caution than an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Working on contemporary comics, where there is no pre-existing database, and no automated or&nbsp;straightforward tagging of images, it would be easy to&nbsp;see mark-up or tagging as a hurdle, and a problematic&nbsp;one at that, given the fraught nature of remediating&nbsp;pictorial information into values that can be entered&nbsp;into a database. But, although I must design my own&nbsp;data tags and ontology, I do not have a mandate to&nbsp;preserve, gatekeep, or distribute otherwise&nbsp;inaccessible data since my objects of study are widely&nbsp;available. Focussing on individual texts, too, affords&nbsp;me time to spend designing tailored data tags and&nbsp;ontologies. I do not need to preserve, that is my&nbsp;freedom; I cannot be ‘objective’, that is my strength.&nbsp;My objects of study are relatively small; that means I&nbsp;do not have to be singular, I can be multiple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Digital approaches, especially to comics (Walsh, 2012) (Dunst et al., 2016), often rely on a single&nbsp;categorisation of each entity or attribute. This paper&nbsp;will argue, rather, that our databases ought to be&nbsp;multiple. Rather than text-mining, a metaphor which&nbsp;suggests the removal of gratuitous material, I would&nbsp;encourage thinking of this practice as data curation, or&nbsp;rather, curations. Consider the analogy of a virtual&nbsp;museum with access to a complete catalogue of&nbsp;material - for is this not like our complete texts? -where anybody can hang the material in whatever&nbsp;way, in whatever ways, they choose. Different paths&nbsp;through the information can be curated, different&nbsp;logics created, retaining the plurality of signification&nbsp;that each piece holds, resisting positivism. This may&nbsp;well tell us as much about our hypothetical hangers as&nbsp;about the hung objects, but therein lies an&nbsp;opportunity. If curation - like datasets, data structures&nbsp;and algorithms - is argument, then why not bring&nbsp;multiple perspectives into conversation? And if we can&nbsp;represent data multiplicitously, we can do it&nbsp;investigatively. By creating multiple ontologies and&nbsp;data tags it is possible to embrace Brian Massumi’s&nbsp;judgement, “[t]he question is not: is it true? But: does&nbsp;it work? What new thoughts does it make possible to&nbsp;think?” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: xv)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since datasets are arguments, marking up the same data differently allows researchers to avoid asserting&nbsp;single values for complex, or simply ambiguous, pieces&nbsp;of information. It also liberates us to encode&nbsp;arguments we disagree with, or at least that we&nbsp;concede are problematic, in order to better&nbsp;understand or critique them. The reduction of gender&nbsp;to a binary, for instance, has been highlighted as an&nbsp;issue in quantitative approaches (Clement, 2016).&nbsp;This, of course, drags up familiar tensions between&nbsp;anti-essentialism and feminism, but if we can encode&nbsp;different modes of representing gender - or any other&nbsp;‘attribute’ which is better represented on a spectrum -including the reductive binary mode, we can maintain&nbsp;the plurality of our data, whilst retaining the&nbsp;possibility to see how the text subverts such a binary&nbsp;categorisation; we bring the text to bear on the theory&nbsp;and in so doing, better understand the theoretical&nbsp;position of the text. Image tagging can operate in a&nbsp;similar way, by tagging the same pictorial signifier in&nbsp;multiple ways we can tag with an intention to&nbsp;investigate, not merely minimise violence to the text.&nbsp;By contrasting and combining different ontologies it is&nbsp;possible to shed light on our texts and to allow our&nbsp;texts to shed light on our ontologies, all the while&nbsp;fracturing any notion of computational methods as&nbsp;objective black boxes by foregrounding their&nbsp;artificiality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Embracing a conceptualisation of Humanities data as complex and plural, this paper will use examples&nbsp;from my own research remediating graphic novels&nbsp;into databases to demonstrate how deploying multiple&nbsp;tags and multiple ontologies not only instantiates a&nbsp;more feminist approach to data but is actually a&nbsp;productive methodology for analysing texts. It&nbsp;champions not the analysis of datasets, but rather an&nbsp;analysis by datasets. As Laura Mandell said in Krakow,&nbsp;we need “metadata built for thinking, not&nbsp;sustainability.” (Brown et al., 2016)</span></p>
