<p><span class="font2">The poster is devoted to the project we are currently working on at the Jagiellonian University&nbsp;with digital media artists, programmers, and theorists:&nbsp;the creative computing laboratory. The main aim of&nbsp;this team is to research the creative process in its&nbsp;widest definition in the era of digital textuality. Digital&nbsp;literature is the focus of our study, above all highly&nbsp;computational literature. In the laboratory&nbsp;environment a team of artists, theorists, and&nbsp;programmers are working on the forms of&nbsp;contemporary creative programming, closely tied to&nbsp;the choice of programming language and the platform&nbsp;on which the work is written. One of the project's aims&nbsp;is to create digital artwork in the laboratory system,&nbsp;and to produce an academic description of the process.&nbsp;The invited artists, theorists, and programmers are&nbsp;gathered in three spheres of creative programming:&nbsp;text generators, interactive fiction, and experiments&nbsp;with augmented reality. One of the outputs of the&nbsp;project is a catalog and an archive of programed&nbsp;works, both for research and for teaching. The team is&nbsp;also focusing on the phenomenon of homegrown&nbsp;“writing under constraint” techniques, which are seen&nbsp;as precursors to creative programing techniques. As&nbsp;part of our search for original and undiscovered&nbsp;phenomena in the humanities, we are researching the&nbsp;local demoscene as an example of creative teamwork&nbsp;in digital media. This project is being carried out as a&nbsp;transdisciplinary task, at the crossroads of computer&nbsp;studies, literary studies, creative writing,&nbsp;experimental literature, and digital media. It also&nbsp;develops new tools in humanities research&nbsp;(laboratory teamwork) and new genres and&nbsp;communication practices (technical reports, open&nbsp;notebook science). As part of the project we are&nbsp;producing expressive processing (presupposing&nbsp;knowledge of the code) and platform studies&nbsp;(presupposing thorough knowledge of the capabilities&nbsp;of the platform where the works are written) tools for&nbsp;describing digital works. One of the aims of the project&nbsp;is to create a retro platform archive, as well as an&nbsp;archive of Polish works written for various platforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poster will present the team's one year experience (the lab was launched in May 2016). We&nbsp;will focus on the most important terms in the&nbsp;dictionary useful for the lab's team, methods&nbsp;developed in collaboration between theorists, artist&nbsp;and programmers working together in the academic&nbsp;context. Moreover, we will build a guide on how to&nbsp;build such an institution in the geopolitical, economic&nbsp;and cultural context, which determine the scope of our&nbsp;research, approach, structure and significance of the&nbsp;lab. By describing our lab, we try to tackle trends that&nbsp;are relevant to contemporary studies on digital media,&nbsp;taking into account and affirming the local&nbsp;perspective, which is different from the dominant one.</span></p>
