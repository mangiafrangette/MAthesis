<p><span class="font4">University of New Hampshire, United States of America</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The World Wide Web provides the research community with an unprecedented abundance of&nbsp;primary sources for diachronically tracing, examining&nbsp;and understanding major events and transformations&nbsp;in our society (such as the rise of euroscepticism or the&nbsp;impact of the recent economic crisis). For two decades,&nbsp;public and private institutions have preserved these&nbsp;born-digital materials for future analysis (Gomes and&nbsp;Costa, 2011). However, these collections are now so&nbsp;large that it is infeasible for researchers to study&nbsp;political and social phenomena by examining them in&nbsp;their entirety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Creating event collections. </span><span class="font4">A common solution that web archives are currently adopting for&nbsp;sustaining the use of the collected sources in&nbsp;humanities research is to offer topic-specific&nbsp;collections. For example, on </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Archive-it</span><span class="font4">, the Internet&nbsp;Archive presents a few collections on large-scale&nbsp;events such as the Boston Marathon Bombing, Black&nbsp;Lives Matter and the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The collections are curated “by the Archive-It team in conjunction with curators and subject matter experts&nbsp;from institutions around the world” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another solution for creating event collections from large datasets is a filtering approach that collects&nbsp;only documents that mention the name of the event;&nbsp;this method has been employed for example in&nbsp;temporal summarization tasks (see Aslam et al.,&nbsp;2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Current limitations. </span><span class="font4">The collections created following one of these two approaches share crucial&nbsp;limitations: a) they are small in number; b) the&nbsp;selection process is not always transparent; c) they&nbsp;generally offer only documents that are closely related&nbsp;to an event but lack information on background stories&nbsp;as well as contextual clues. Especially the latter is a&nbsp;crucial issue for historical analyses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our vision. </span><span class="font4">We are currently developing a solution for creating event collections that identifies not only&nbsp;the core documents related to the event itself, but&nbsp;most importantly sub-groups of documents which&nbsp;describe related aspects. We do so through an&nbsp;expansion process that is informed by latently&nbsp;relevant concepts and entities from a knowledge base,&nbsp;whose presence in documents is interpreted as one of&nbsp;many indicators of relevance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Specific contribution</span><span class="font4">. At the DH conference we intend to present the final results of our study,&nbsp;together with its application for supporting research&nbsp;in political and social history.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Let us consider an event, for example the Syrian Civil War, as a node in a knowledge graph (e.g.&nbsp;DBpedia).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a first step, a domain expert will identify a series of other entities in the knowledge graph that are&nbsp;highly related to the event (in Nanni et al., 2016, we&nbsp;show that this step could be automatized adopting a&nbsp;simple relatedness measure). These could be people,&nbsp;such as Bashar Al-Assad as well as countries (e.g.&nbsp;Turkey, Russia, United States), concepts (e.g. Protests)&nbsp;and other specific events (e.g. The Refugee Crisis).&nbsp;These initial seeds will support us in retrieving other&nbsp;related entities and concepts from the knowledge&nbsp;graph in an automated fashion (we described our&nbsp;solution in Nanni et al. 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While retrieving related entities is important, these are meaningless without human-readable&nbsp;descriptions of the entity’s relation to the event. As a&nbsp;matter of fact, the entity United States has many&nbsp;different aspects, and only few of them are related to&nbsp;the event Syrian Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to retrieve entities in context, we use Wikipedia as an initial corpus. Next, relevant passages&nbsp;from the documents are identified in the collection by&nbsp;information retrieval. Having the entity in context will&nbsp;tell us with which words, concepts and other entities&nbsp;it frequently appears together (a complete overview of&nbsp;the method is presented in Nanni et al., 2017). For&nbsp;example, if a document mentions the United States&nbsp;together with James Foley and ISIS, it is likely to be&nbsp;related to the Syrian Civil War, even without&nbsp;mentioning these words explicitly.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Case studies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We are currently working on two different research tasks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first study is focused on identifying</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">political speeches on foreign events (such as elections in other countries) in the US&nbsp;Congressional Records&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1989-2016),</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">which are available on Congress.gov and through the Internet Archive&nbsp;(Congress.gov provides full-text access to&nbsp;daily congressional record issues dating&nbsp;from 1995, beginning with the 104th&nbsp;Congress. Proceedings for previous years&nbsp;are available on </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">THOMAS)</span><span class="font4">. The goal is to&nbsp;measure the amount of attention that US&nbsp;politicians give to international events in&nbsp;correlation with other internal affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second study, we intend to detect</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">similar patterns during the early rise of anti-establishment protests. Our aim is to&nbsp;uncover small events, which did not turn&nbsp;into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large-scale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insurrections and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">therefore are not studied sufficiently. The work is conducted on a large (16 terabyte)&nbsp;web archive of news, blogs, forums and&nbsp;social media, namely the TREC Streaming&nbsp;Corpus (This corpus is a huge web archive&nbsp;collection collected between 2012 and&nbsp;2014). Finally, the goal of the project is to&nbsp;obtain a better understanding on how and&nbsp;why specific protests succeed while others&nbsp;do not (also in correlation with analyses&nbsp;from the previous study).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Experiments</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Identifying related entities. </span><span class="font4">In a previous work (Nanni et al., 2016), we have first established the&nbsp;quality of our entity-relatedness solution&nbsp;(Eventipedia), by comparing it with a series of other&nbsp;baselines commonly used in the field. The results are&nbsp;reported in Figure 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">While our entity-relatedness solution outperformed the other tested methods, it also showed a few&nbsp;limitations. In fact, this approach (in its fully&nbsp;automated fashion) tends to privilege specific entities&nbsp;over the most commonly mentioned entities. We&nbsp;address this in developing techniques that are&nbsp;supervised by domain experts; this ensures us to&nbsp;always consider the most relevant related entities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Collect entities in context. </span><span class="font4">Additionally we studied the identification of human-readable&nbsp;descriptions of the entity’s connection to the event. We&nbsp;compared our entity link-based approach with a&nbsp;common information retrieval heuristic which&nbsp;considers the first sentences of the entity’s Wikipedia&nbsp;article, as a relevant passage (Wiki-Intro).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Figure 2. Evaluation on retrieving entities in context (from Nanni et al., 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results are presented in Figure 2. In 45% of the cases, the Wiki-Intro was a sufficient explanation.&nbsp;However, our Eventipedia approach provides&nbsp;sufficient explanations in 68% of the cases. We remark&nbsp;that for nearly all cases, where Eventipedia does&nbsp;provide a snippet, this is also relevant. In contrast, the&nbsp;Wiki-Intro only provides a good explanation in 42% of&nbsp;the cases. This is because many event-relevant entities&nbsp;(e.g. the United States) are often more popularly&nbsp;known for other accomplishments and therefore the&nbsp;first paragraph is not a good description of entity&nbsp;involvement in the event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Retrieve relevant documents. </span><span class="font4">We are currently assessing the quality of our information retrieval&nbsp;solution, which uses entities and contextual passages&nbsp;to retrieve documents about specific events with an&nbsp;approach based on Dalton et al. (2014). We report&nbsp;here the very first results of our study on retrieving&nbsp;speeches about foreign elections. This work has been&nbsp;conducted both on the US Congressional Records on&nbsp;the New York Times Corpus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We compared it with two baselines, a) retrieving all documents that mention the name of the country (e.g.&nbsp;“Syria”) and b) retrieving all documents that precisely&nbsp;mention the name of the event (e.g. “election in Syria”).&nbsp;It is evident that the first solution is recall-oriented,&nbsp;while the second, already adopted by the TREC&nbsp;temporal summarization task, favors precision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Given an event, such as the Syrian presidential election, 2007, all three methods produce a ranking of&nbsp;documents. We examine the quality of the ranking&nbsp;considering 15 different elections. For each election,&nbsp;we created a gold standard of 45 documents (relevant&nbsp;and non relevant). Table 1 presents the results in term&nbsp;of mean-average precision (MAP) on the two datasets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Table 1. First results (MAP) on the collection-building task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results of this initial study lead to a few findings. First we see that, especially on the US&nbsp;Congressional Records, using the name of the event&nbsp;permits to collect a fraction of relevant documents, but&nbsp;not all of them. Second, our solution, which uses&nbsp;related entities in context, provides good performance&nbsp;quality on both datasets. Third, our solution is able to&nbsp;identify materials that do not explicitly mention the&nbsp;name of the event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Non-relevant” documents. </span><span class="font4">We next analyze what kind of “non-relevant” documents the different&nbsp;systems retrieved among the top elements of the&nbsp;ranking. Non-relevant documents retrieved by the&nbsp;“Event name” solution often discuss different topics&nbsp;and simply mention the event out of context; these&nbsp;documents could be for example general summaries of&nbsp;the previous week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead, non-relevant documents retrieved by Eventipedia are often related to the political activity of&nbsp;a foreign country, but not specifically about the&nbsp;election. For example, they could mention the visit of a&nbsp;candidate to Washington, a few months before the&nbsp;vote. It is evident that choosing one method over the&nbsp;other will shape the event-collection in a different&nbsp;way. Ultimately, it is up to the humanities researcher&nbsp;to decide which documents are most important for the&nbsp;analysis.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
