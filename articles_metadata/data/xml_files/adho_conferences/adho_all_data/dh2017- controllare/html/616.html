<p><span class="font4">Tulane University, United States of America</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As one of the defining features of Latin literature, the influence exerted by the Greek linguistic and textual traditions has remained a key focus of the Classics.&nbsp;One of the manifestations of this intersection of cultures is in the topic of wordplay, or puns. Authors such&nbsp;as Vergil and Lucretius have been shown to utilize the&nbsp;metrical rules of pronunciation to embed Greek word&nbsp;forms in their poetry, and in the process, reference&nbsp;others works of literature and convey ideas beyond&nbsp;the superficial level of the text. While the influence of&nbsp;Greek writings upon Latin literature has received considerable scrutiny, the use of Greek puns has received&nbsp;only limited inquiry. Previous studies on puns, notably&nbsp;those of Snyder (1980) and Ahl (1985) are limited in&nbsp;scope and focus mainly on the relationship of Latin&nbsp;puns to Latin literature. Furthermore, studies which&nbsp;focus on Greek puns within Latin are limited primarily&nbsp;to writing about specific examples or a specific Latin&nbsp;author, such as O'Hara (1996) and his discussion of&nbsp;Greek word use in Vergil. Similarly, the recent (2013)&nbsp;compilation of studies edited by Kwapisz, Szymanski,&nbsp;and Petrain examining Greek and Latin wordplay does&nbsp;not look at the intersection of the two. Building upon&nbsp;previous strategies for data mining including the Tesserae Project, this paper seeks to offer a digital means&nbsp;to cross-reference Latin literature with Greek texts in&nbsp;order to find puns.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The program</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Since the formation of our collaboration, we have produced software capable of detecting potential candidates for Greek puns. To achieve this end, we first set&nbsp;out to account for the rules of pronunciation within</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Latin poetry by referencing works such as Halporn et al. (1980), with issues such as elision and the lack of&nbsp;pronunciation of certain syllables addressed within&nbsp;the software. We then looked to set equivalence of pronunciation between Greek and Latin letters and&nbsp;groups of syllables, such as diphthongs. This was accomplished through examining transliterated Greek&nbsp;names and words which appear in Latin literature and&nbsp;using grammars including Smyth (1920). Additionally,&nbsp;certain Greek vowels and consonants which could correspond to multiple vowels, consonants, or syllables in&nbsp;Latin were also considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Accounting for these rules, we developed a processing system whereby Greek pronunciation equivalence is run through strands of Latin text. The software begins by reading one chosen Latin text in .txt format&nbsp;and then reading one or more Greek texts in .txt format, with all texts requiring UNICODE encoding for&nbsp;proper registration within the identification system.&nbsp;Once a Latin and Greek text(s) have been selected, the&nbsp;file paths are passed asynchronously into the model&nbsp;for processing. Both texts are then processed at the&nbsp;same time on different threads and the calling method&nbsp;waits for the completion of both methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Greek text string is first processed by stripping off any accent or breathing mark and returning the&nbsp;base letter to lower case. While iterating through all&nbsp;characters in the text, when a space or new line character is reached, the previous word captured is added&nbsp;to a list. A word is not added to the list if it has previously been added to the list or the length of the word&nbsp;is less than a number for which the program allows&nbsp;specification. The result of this method is a list of those&nbsp;unique Greek words which appear in a chosen Greek&nbsp;text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Latin text string is first processed by converting all letters to lower case and taking account of the rules of elision and pronunciation. Similar to the Greek&nbsp;processing, the processed Latin text is converted into&nbsp;words. Each Latin word in the list is processed to determine if part of the word should be elided, based on&nbsp;the starting letter of the next word. The final step is to&nbsp;condense all the Latin words together into one text&nbsp;string without spaces, while keeping a list of the starting position of each word in the text string.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once the two processing methods reach completion, the model has the list of unique Greek words and a string of Latin words, including the starting position&nbsp;in the original text of each word. The final processing&nbsp;method compares the Greek words to the Latin text&nbsp;string to find matches and returns a list of matches,&nbsp;which include the starting position of the match, ending position of the match, and the Greek word that&nbsp;matched. First, each letter of every Greek word is converted to a list of possible Latin characters or pairs of&nbsp;characters. A dictionary exists that for each base Greek&nbsp;lower case letter there corresponds a list of Latin letters or pairs of letters. Similarly, the existence of a&nbsp;diphthong is determined by referencing the values of&nbsp;a Greek-Latin diphthong dictionary. Both dictionaries&nbsp;were developed by examining those grammars and&nbsp;references noted earlier. By iterating though every&nbsp;Greek letter in a Greek word the possible Latin letters&nbsp;can be looked up in the dictionary, and, if the current&nbsp;letter and next letter in the Greek word are in the diphthong dictionary, this will override the regular dictionary lookup function. Once a list of every possible Latin&nbsp;correspondence for every letter in a Greek word exists,&nbsp;all permutations of letters are returned in a list of&nbsp;strings. This list is the list of every possible Latin series&nbsp;of characters that could match a Greek word. Using a&nbsp;regular expression every match in the Latin text string&nbsp;is found based on the previous list. These results are&nbsp;returned as a list of Greek words, including the starting and ending position in the original Latin text of the&nbsp;match.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The unique list of Latin-to-Greek results is returned to the view and is displayed in a grid, which can be&nbsp;sorted alphabetically, wherein the left column contains the uncompressed Latin character matches and&nbsp;the right column the Greek word equivalent in Greek&nbsp;characters. Also, a flow document is created which&nbsp;contains the original text with the matches highlighted&nbsp;in yellow and the matching Greek words to the right&nbsp;for each line. The Greek words in brackets are words&nbsp;that correspond to the same Latin text location, thus&nbsp;assisting the program user in contextualizing and applying significance to the results.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Results and applications</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Through operation of the software, possible candidates for Greek puns within various Latin authors have been identified. By cross-referencing opensource texts of Vergil's </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Carmina</span><span class="font4"> of Catullus with the Homeric epics and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Argonautica,</span><span class="font4"> we&nbsp;have discovered hereto unnoticed Greek words, the&nbsp;meanings of which often correspond to the thematic&nbsp;concerns of the passage. Considering the limited extent of the search, both in duration and in those texts&nbsp;analyzed, these results seem to suggest that there are&nbsp;a considerable number of Greek puns remaining to be&nbsp;found within the corpus of Latin literature. While we&nbsp;are currently still in the process of refining the software and in consideration of more comprehensive&nbsp;ways to cross-reference Greek texts, we are still looking to expand the search both towards those texts already analyzed and to other Latin authors. With a&nbsp;view to the future, it is our hope that this software will&nbsp;eventually become available for public use and that it&nbsp;can lead to a more nuanced view of the role which&nbsp;Greek culture and language plays in Latin literature.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Program diagram</span></h2>
