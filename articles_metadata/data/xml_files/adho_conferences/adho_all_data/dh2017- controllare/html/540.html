<p><span class="font3">Ada Lovelace is widely held to be the first computer programmer, composing the first algorithm designed&nbsp;for execution by a general purpose computing machine. The algorithm was published in the “notes by&nbsp;the translator”, appended to her translation of Mene-brea's 1842 French account of Charles Babbage's 1840&nbsp;seminar on his proposed steam-powered computer,&nbsp;the Analytical Engine, at the University of Turin (Lovelace, 1842).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This third-remove contribution appearing in small print after the main article belies both the closeness of&nbsp;her friendship with Babbage and how extraordinary&nbsp;her vision was of what such a general purpose computing machine could achieve. The phrase often quoted&nbsp;in the literature of computers and music offers another insight into her imaginative response to the hypothetical Analytical Engine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such&nbsp;expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.” (Note A)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our work described in this paper explores this observation, taking inspiration both from Lovelace's ideas and from composer Emily Howard's creative response to them. Using digital technologies, we have&nbsp;prototyped software and hardware to investigate</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lovelace's theory of creative computing. We developed a web-based tool, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Numbers into Notes</span><span class="font3">, which we used as a prompt to engage the public with these ideas&nbsp;at live musical performances. The musical outcomes of&nbsp;our research are recorded as Digital Music Objects&nbsp;(De Roure, 2016a) which include provenance records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following Galey and Ruecker, we suggest that this application can be viewed as a designed digital artefact&nbsp;analogous to a critical work, explicating our interpretation of Lovelace's words (Galey, 2010).</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Simulator</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Babbage's Analytical Engine remains unconstructed, but today we can simulate the execution of programs on it digitally, based on the detailed accounts of the Engine's design provided by Babbage and&nbsp;Lovelace. As an experiment in hearing what Lovelace&nbsp;might have imagined, we coded an algorithm to run on&nbsp;a simulator in order to generate number sequences&nbsp;which are then mapped to instruments. The numbers&nbsp;are strictly faithful to nineteenth-century mathematics. Human intervention decides the algorithmic parameters and the mapping of the numbers to notes and&nbsp;instruments, to be explored based on the musical context of the time. This experiment led to the creation of&nbsp;the Numbers into Notes web site, making the tools&nbsp;available to others for investigation and composition.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Performance</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Emily Howard has also responded creatively to Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A, and the life of Lovelace, in composing her </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lovelace</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Trilogy</span><span class="font3"> (Petri-Preis, 2013). ‘Ada sketches' is a short</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">operatic work for mezzo-soprano, flute, clarinet and percussion. Howard's time as Composer in Residence&nbsp;at the University of Liverpool's Department of Mathematics, and her work there with Lasse Rempe-Gillen,&nbsp;led to this piece which has been performed in formats&nbsp;that encourage audience response and participation. A&nbsp;performance at the University of Oxford as part of celebrations to mark Lovelace's 200th birthday investigated the audience's reception of the work. Its most recent performance, at the Royal Northern College of&nbsp;Music, used our Numbers into Notes web application.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Digital-physical</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Numbers into Notes software invites a thought experiment: had Lovelace lived longer, and had Babbage successfully built the Analytical Engine, what&nbsp;might have happened in pursuit of Lovelace's musical&nbsp;observation? We extended this thought experiment to&nbsp;ask “what might Lovelace do today?” To explore this,&nbsp;we constructed multiple physical devices (based on&nbsp;the Arduino open-source electronic prototyping platform) to re-enact the algorithms designed for the Analytical Engine (De Roure, 2016b). Today Lovelace&nbsp;could combine multiple machines, and the computational power would enable real-time synthesis, putting into practice the mathematical notions of consonance that were established in the eighteenth century.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Experimental humanities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This approach, which we suggest might be framed as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">experimental humanities</span><span class="font3">, has attracted engagement&nbsp;during events and online, and has also been a successful vehicle in teaching (in the Social Humanities strand&nbsp;of the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School).&nbsp;Our work uses digital tools, co-designing digital and&nbsp;digital-physical artefacts, to explore and re-imagine&nbsp;prospective and theoretical technologies of Lovelace's&nbsp;day. Through this we provoke new responses and discoveries relating to music practice and performance,&nbsp;and to the philosophy and history of technology. The&nbsp;practice of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">experimental humanities</span><span class="font3"> approach enables critical reflection and re-interpretation: we suggest that the digital artefacts we have produced are&nbsp;each interpretations drawing on the life and writing of&nbsp;Lovelace, and the value of this practice lies in the new&nbsp;insights and works they inspire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper recounts these experiments that play at once into generative design and into alternative histories of algorithms and mechanisms. Through making,&nbsp;through prototyping and co-design, we close-read the&nbsp;thought processes Lovelace and Babbage recorded.&nbsp;We point to paths in the development of computing&nbsp;and programming that were not taken, and extend beyond what was practicable in the nineteenth century.&nbsp;Our work also touches on creativity, as anticipated by&nbsp;Lovelace and recast in the “Lovelace questions” (Boden, 1990), and manifest today in the fields of computational creativity and creative computing.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgements</span></h2>
