<p><span class="font3">This project uses network graphs to depict musicians' careers in late seventeenth-century Venice. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">current network graph, viewable on the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Musicians in Venice web page</span><span class="font3">, demonstrates relationships between&nbsp;musicians and the institutions that employed them.&nbsp;The graph is bimodal, with nodes representing musicians (“people” nodes) and institutions (“place”&nbsp;nodes). Archival texts are incorporated into the visualization, with transcriptions of records that indicate&nbsp;musicians' activity included in the node attributes. The&nbsp;entire project is text-based, with data derived from&nbsp;XML transcriptions of archival records in addition to&nbsp;assigned metadata. The current website is a proof of&nbsp;concept for a larger project that would demonstrate&nbsp;ways of displaying text as part of the network graph&nbsp;and using texts in creating network visualizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The current graph focuses on the career of the composer Giovanni Legrenzi. Legrenzi worked for several prominent Venetian institutions from the early 1670s&nbsp;to his death in 1690 and ultimately was appointed to&nbsp;the most prestigious musical posts in the city. The musicians he worked with also served multiple institutions, either simultaneously or in succession, and their&nbsp;relationships with other musicians, patrons, and administrators often facilitated their movement between&nbsp;institutions. Legrenzi's Venetian career presents an&nbsp;excellent case study of these musical connections in&nbsp;late seventeenth-century Venice, and studying these&nbsp;connections demonstrates how networks of musicians&nbsp;functioned in this time period. This study also provides a representative sample of how network visualization effectively demonstrates patterns in musicians'&nbsp;careers in Venice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The texts in the network graph include transcribed administrative documents, mostly unpublished, from&nbsp;the Venetian institutions where Legrenzi was active&nbsp;between 1670 and 1690. These are primarily payment, hiring, and termination records, which document the activity of the musicians employed by or affiliated with these institutions. Several generations of&nbsp;musicologists have used these documents to identify&nbsp;where different musicians were working, when they&nbsp;were employed, and in what capacity (Bonta, 1964;&nbsp;Moore, 1981; Termini, 1981; and Selfridge-Field,&nbsp;1994). In this sense, this treatment of the documents&nbsp;is standard to the field, but applies DH methodology&nbsp;and processes to create visual representations the&nbsp;data. This provides a new perspective on the sources.&nbsp;For instance, grouping the “person” nodes by centrality results in multiple sub-groups, and proximity&nbsp;among these nodes demonstrates shared institutions&nbsp;and implied communities. (Hanneman and Riddle,&nbsp;2005: Chapter 10) (Mary Russell Mitford's text-based&nbsp;network analysis of Robert Southey’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Thalaba the Destroyer</span><span class="font3"> provides an excellent example of this. In addition to demonstrating the behavior of agile, well-connected nodes, the graph displays modules of nodes as&nbsp;units of analysis (Wasserman and Faust, 1994: 4).&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The transcriptions of the original documents were encoded in XML with tags and attributes determined&nbsp;by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). I used the XML&nbsp;markup to tag the information I wanted to include in&nbsp;my data while retaining the complete original text. In&nbsp;general, I tagged the name of the musician, the name&nbsp;of the institution with which they were connected, and&nbsp;the date and location of the connection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9322 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9323</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">XML markup of primary document text</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I then extracted the information for the network from the XML document using an XSLT. For this project, the stylesheet extracted the data assembled in the&nbsp;person index of the XML document and combined it&nbsp;with the entire text that documented each event. The&nbsp;resultant document was a CSV file of raw data that had&nbsp;to be separated into sets of nodes and edges to be read&nbsp;by the visualization platform. The data visualization&nbsp;for this project was generated using Gephi, which is an&nbsp;open-source platform for exploratory data analysis.&nbsp;For this project, I generated the network graph in&nbsp;Gephi by importing two CSV files: one with the nodes&nbsp;and their attributes and ID numbers, and one with the&nbsp;edges and the source and target data. The online version of the network graph includes all the text associated with a “person” node in the network as a node attribute. When the user selects a person node in the&nbsp;online version, it displays the transcriptions for every&nbsp;document mentioning that person in the Information&nbsp;Pane. (I exported the data using the SigmaExporter</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">plugin for Gephi. Version 0.9.0 from Gephi Thirdpar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ties Plugins. The code is available on </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Github</span><span class="font3">.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Displaying all the text associated with a person node presented a challenge as the XSLT exported each&nbsp;connection between a musician and an institution as a&nbsp;new line in the CSV. For instance, if a musician was&nbsp;hired by a church in 1674, received a raise in 1678, and&nbsp;retired in 1686, there would be three lines in the CSV.&nbsp;When imported into Gephi, this would create three&nbsp;connecting edges between the person node and the&nbsp;place node. This created a misleading network graph,&nbsp;as the number of documented connections between&nbsp;people and places depended on the nature and availability of the records. To combine all the texts associated with the events for each person in the index, I concatenated the raw data using a PHP script and saved&nbsp;the results as a TSV file that could be imported into&nbsp;Gephi. As a result, the entire context of the decrees and&nbsp;decisions surrounding that musician's activity appears&nbsp;in the Information Pane, which also displays and links&nbsp;to the institutions associated with that musician. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PHP script also included HTML formatting to better distinguish the entries from one another in the visualization. Once my nodes and edges were imported into&nbsp;Gephi, I used a layout that grouped the nodes by degree of centrality (Algorithm in Gephi based on&nbsp;Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre, 2008.&nbsp;Resolution in Gephi based Lambiotte, Delvenne, and&nbsp;Barahona, 2009).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Network graph in Gephi</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Next steps</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The current graph is the foundation of a more extensive project that uses musicians and musical activity in Early Modern Venice to benefit scholars working with TEI in similar for-hire environments. In these environments, hubs of activity define the relationship between individual practitioners in the historical equivalent of a sharing economy. In the long-term, I propose&nbsp;an online data repository and network graph of musicians working in seventeenth-century Venice that&nbsp;would eventually provide a roadmap for scholars embedded in the TEI transcription model, but with an interest in an automated process for applying TEI text&nbsp;analysis to network analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the bimodal graph that highlights relationships between musicians and their employing institutions, I also hope to create a unimodal graph&nbsp;documenting relationships among the musicians. Creating the unimodal network and a supporting web application will be a challenge as relationships between&nbsp;individuals can be complicated and dynamic. This will&nbsp;take considerable work in effectively diagramming entity relationships and building web applications that&nbsp;go beyond the “out of the box” functionality of the&nbsp;Gephi export plugin. The website for the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Six Degrees of&nbsp;Francis Bacon</span><span class="font3"> project provides an excellent example&nbsp;of a unimodal graph; here the relationships are de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">fined by circumstances (such as “father to” or “colleague of”) or actions (such as “met” or “wrote to”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Linked Jazz</span><span class="font3">, which uses documents as node attributes to demonstrate relationships and meaningful connections between jazz musicians in an interactive network graph, is also an excellent example. Both sites&nbsp;feature custom-designed entity relationships and interactive features in their web design that I want to&nbsp;emulate in my own network graph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the unimodal version, I would expand the data beyond Legrenzi's Venetian career, increasing the&nbsp;time frame and the number of institutions represented&nbsp;in the graph, and include different kinds of sources,&nbsp;such as periodicals, correspondence, and notarial records. Developing relationship typologies is such a crucial component to the project. This will require creating custom node metadata based on the information&nbsp;from the primary sources and agile development as&nbsp;the number and variety documents expand. The result&nbsp;will be a project that can better serve other scholars of&nbsp;Venetian music and culture.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
