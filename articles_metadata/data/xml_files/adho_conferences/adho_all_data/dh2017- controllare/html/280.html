<p><span class="font1">This poster session will introduce DH Box, a browser-based platform that provides access to a variety of difficult-to-install digital humanities tools.&nbsp;Currently under development at The Graduate Center,&nbsp;CUNY, and funded by generous assistance from an&nbsp;NEH Startup Grant, DH Box is designed with particular&nbsp;attention to digital humanities pedagogy. Because&nbsp;teaching DH requires infrastructure of various kinds,&nbsp;including computing resources, IT support, and teachers with specialized training, student access to the digital humanities is unevenly distributed and highly dependent on local institutional conditions. Faculty with&nbsp;DH skills are often called upon to teach classes and&nbsp;workshops in adverse circumstances, contending with&nbsp;limited access to labs or other computing resources,&nbsp;restrictive IT policies that prevent new software from&nbsp;being installed, and platform fragmentation on student-owned machines. As a cloud-based platform, DH&nbsp;Box was conceived to address some of these concerns&nbsp;by providing a set of digital humanities tools through&nbsp;a unified computing environment accessed through&nbsp;the browser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">DH Box is not a service, nor is it a standalone application that runs on local computers. Rather, it is software that can be set up by teachers or institutions on cloud-based infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services or DigitalOcean. DH Box is an open-source project developed by and for teachers and researchers in&nbsp;the humanities, and as such is intended to provide an&nbsp;alternative to proprietary services that prevent access&nbsp;to user data. DH Box also makes an intervention in&nbsp;terms of design, UX, and usability. The platform uses a&nbsp;virtualization technology called Docker to quickly create and remove digital working environments, providing students with access to either shared work spaces&nbsp;or individualized virtual machines. Each of these environments contains a set of tools and utilities frequently used in the digital humanities, including IPy-thon Notebooks, the Natural Language Toolkit, MALLET, Omeka, and WordPress. DH Box's tab-based&nbsp;browsing interface makes it possible to easily switch&nbsp;between these utilities, the command line, and a text&nbsp;editor. In addition to providing DH tools in a unified&nbsp;computing environment, the platform offers resources&nbsp;in partnership with institutions like the British Library, making digitized texts available for student exploration. By integrating Git Lit, a tool for downloading&nbsp;text corpora developed in partnership with Columbia&nbsp;University, DH Box provides access not only to digital&nbsp;humanities tools, but also to materials for analysis and&nbsp;experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even as it aims to circumvent institutional barriers to DH scholarship, DH Box addresses broader questions of access to DH tools. The necessity for specialized knowledge--use of the command line, importing&nbsp;packages and modules, configuring a working envi-ronment--may deter students from pursuing research&nbsp;questions using these novel methods. Making these&nbsp;tools more accessible, on the other hand, should help&nbsp;encourage a new generation of DH scholars. By allowing teachers and students to bypass the difficult process of installation and configuration, the DH Box team&nbsp;hopes to give them room to focus on exploration and&nbsp;experimentation. During the DH Box poster presentation, team members will be available to discuss decisions of design as well as future use cases.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Resources</span></h2>
