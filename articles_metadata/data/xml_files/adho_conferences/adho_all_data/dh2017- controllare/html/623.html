<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Graph Poem Project</span><span class="font1"> at University of Ottawa develops tools for poetry computational analysis and applies graph theory and network graph computational apps in structuring, analyzing, and visualizing poetic&nbsp;corpora. The concept involves generating network&nbsp;graphs (multigraphs) in which the vertices are poems&nbsp;and the edges represent various commonalities between poems in terms of subject, diction, form, style,&nbsp;and other criteria. By computationally analyzing the&nbsp;network graph certain extremely interesting and potentially useful information can be extracted regarding&nbsp;a specific corpus. For instance, by identifying cut vertices, we find out which poem(s) play a crucial role in&nbsp;the connectivity of the network and therefore also in&nbsp;the cohesion of the corpus, since by removing that particular poem-node the whole network becomes disconnected, and thus the corpus per se without that&nbsp;particular poem would become disarticulate and divided; and similarly, cut edges signal connections between certain poems that are of paramount importance in the connectivity of the entire network.&nbsp;Identifying cliques of nodes, on the other hand, for instance, shows how poems within a corpus are clustered and which parts of a specific oeuvre, collection,&nbsp;or anthology are more self-contained than others or&nbsp;which poems belong together across or within divides&nbsp;such as authorship, school, period or region, etc. More&nbsp;generally, representing corpora as network multigraphs makes possible analyzing and visualizing both&nbsp;small and significantly large datasets (so far up to hundreds of thousands) of poems, and reach certain information and conclusions about both particular poems&nbsp;in that corpus and the corpus as a whole or as compared to other corpora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is one of the first respects in which the issue of access becomes of dramatic importance for our research and for developing and testing our tools; and&nbsp;virtually for any contemporary digital project in poetry. Namely the access to databases and the ability to&nbsp;convert existing files into formats that are compatible&nbsp;to computational processing and analysis. The paper&nbsp;will focus on the existing databases, will review previous work in the field and analyze the kind of data they&nbsp;have employed, will examine the premises and prospects for big data and/or data intensive research in&nbsp;poetry (one of the main tenets of our project), and the&nbsp;arguable absence of such approaches in the published&nbsp;research in the area so far. Terms like “crawl” and&nbsp;“rip” for the poetry available online, and issues related&nbsp;to digitization and/or computationally analyzing poetry in print will also be placed under close scrutiny&nbsp;while we will also report on our own solutions and results, and compare them to those in other projects in&nbsp;digital humanities (DH), digital literary studies, or&nbsp;computational linguistics/analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our research, tools, publications, and future work will therefore be then presented in a comparative&nbsp;manner in the wider context of current trends, theories, and debates in DH in general and text analysis in&nbsp;particular—by considering for instance the potential&nbsp;relevance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Graph Poem Project</span><span class="font1"> to at least some of&nbsp;the issues raised in the “Forum: Text Analysis at Scale”&nbsp;section of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016</span><span class="font1"> (eds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lauren F. Klein and Matthew K. Gold), or literature-related tools/projects such as Syuzhet or heureCLEA—, in natural language processing (NLP)—by reviewing&nbsp;other projects that have dealt with literary computational analysis and particular poetry processing, but&nbsp;also other works that focused on various issues in&nbsp;computational linguistics, such as syntax or trope processing and analysis—, and in digital pedagogy, by relating it to other poetry related digital pedagogical&nbsp;projects (such as those reviewed by Chuck Rybak, for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">instance, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities).</span><span class="font1"> “Access” therefore will turn out to encompass quite a few different meanings and phenomena. In terms of text&nbsp;and data analysis, we will review existing debates and&nbsp;commentaries and contribute our own on the politics&nbsp;of developing poetry archives or assembling collec-tions/anthologies, and the related issues of represen-tationality, especially with regards to gender, race, minority, and so forth. In other words, the question&nbsp;asked will be, what is the access of certain authors and&nbsp;their works to our research and tools, what are their&nbsp;chances to be represented in the graph poem? Then,&nbsp;in terms of existing tools, accessibility refers to either&nbsp;the monetary aspects of acquiring or upgrading certain apps or to accessing the source code and/or repurposing it, and the discussion will gravitate around&nbsp;the political and cultural implications of such options.&nbsp;Access then also means accessibility of our tools to the&nbsp;user, in the sense of how easy or how complicated it is&nbsp;for ‘anybody' to read our approach, use our apps, and&nbsp;employ our results; and why would they ever do it?—&nbsp;how are we trying to ‘seduce' our audience? The paper&nbsp;will hence examine what are the “compromises” we&nbsp;have made in that respect—as for instance in picking&nbsp;2 or 3 dimensions as rhyme sub-types in employing a&nbsp;certain API for displaying rhyme scores as scatter&nbsp;graphs—, and what are the actual efforts we are making in conveying the potential significance of sometimes arcane mathematical theories and algorithms&nbsp;for poetry. But on yet another level, access means success, namely the measure of our project's access to levels of meaning (in Adrian Liu's terms and not only)&nbsp;that may be deemed as ‘deeply' or ‘typically' poetic, an&nbsp;analysis that will combine notions of genre or craft related subtlety with pragmatic computational concerns,&nbsp;such as operationally consolidating numeric and nonnumeric features and commonalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A more prosaic question to address will then be what is the access poetry really has to DH-related research, interest, and funding. Again, the data related&nbsp;to our own project will be compared to others, and the&nbsp;analysis will focus on the place of poetry in significant&nbsp;DH publications, periodicals, and platforms.</span></p>
