<p><span class="font4">Weiso(</span><span class="font3">W^^J</span><span class="font4">), which means </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">&quot;guardhouse&quot;</span><span class="font4">, is one of the military units of the barracks used by the&nbsp;Chinese dynasty Ming (1368-1644) to maintain peace&nbsp;throughout its empire. WeisoEvent is a web-based&nbsp;digital humanity research tool targeting Ming Weiso&nbsp;events recorded in Ming Shilu, which contains the&nbsp;imperial annals of the Ming emperors. WeisoEvent is&nbsp;composed of two parts: (1) an event type classifier that&nbsp;categorizes paragraphs according to their event types;&nbsp;(2) an analytics tool that shows (1)’s result, markups&nbsp;named entities, links guard mentions to Academia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sinica’s Chinese Civilization in Time and Space (CCTS) spatial-temporal platform, and provides four&nbsp;visualization functions. Historians can use this tool to&nbsp;search for specific event types and gain insight into the&nbsp;relationship between particular guards and those&nbsp;event types, not only improving the efficiency but still&nbsp;maintaining the quality of research.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Event type classifier</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">Normally, one would develop a supervised-learning-based text categorization system to classify paragraphs into different event types. This involves&nbsp;defining a set of categories and annotating example&nbsp;texts for each category. However, lacking the human&nbsp;resources needed for such a task, we use unsupervised&nbsp;text clustering, which groups paragraphs into clusters&nbsp;by event type, to generate categories and their&nbsp;corresponding paragraphs for training an automatic&nbsp;event classifier. Although the results are not as&nbsp;accurate as those of pure supervised text&nbsp;classification, this hybrid approach is an acceptable&nbsp;tradeoff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In clustering algorithms, each paragraph is represented as a vector. In previous studies,&nbsp;paragraphs have been represented using the vector&nbsp;space model (VSM), which represents each text as a&nbsp;feature vector of terms. However, this approach loses&nbsp;the ordering and ignores semantics. Yet another&nbsp;representation scheme inspired by word2vec is the&nbsp;“Paragraph Vector” proposed by (Le and Mikolov,&nbsp;2014), an unsupervised framework that learns&nbsp;continuous distributed vectors for pieces of text. In&nbsp;their model, entire paragraphs are represented as&nbsp;vectors. The vector representation is trained to predict&nbsp;the words in a paragraph. More precisely, they&nbsp;concatenate the paragraph vector with several word&nbsp;vectors from a paragraph and predict the following&nbsp;word in the given context. Le’s Paragraph Vector&nbsp;model has many advantages. First, it is mostly&nbsp;unsupervised and works well with sparsely labeled&nbsp;data. Second, it is suitable for text strings of various&nbsp;lengths, ranging from sentences to whole documents.&nbsp;Finally, it can overcome many weaknesses of the bag-of-words and bag-of-n-grams models. Because it does&nbsp;not suffer from data scarcity and high dimensionality,&nbsp;it also preserves the ordering and semantic&nbsp;information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In summary, we propose a classification method which is based on clustering. First, we employ a named&nbsp;entity (NE) recognizer to label texts. Second, we train&nbsp;a paragraph vector model to represent paragraphs as&nbsp;vectors. Third, we cluster paragraphs with length &lt;40</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">characters. Finally, we use the clustering results as gold-standard categories with which to train a&nbsp;support-vector-machines classifier to predict other&nbsp;paragraphs’ categories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We compare our method with the state-of-the-art paragraph clustering method using continuous vector&nbsp;space representation proposed by (M. Chinea-Rios et&nbsp;al., 2015). They use word2vec to learn word vectors&nbsp;and represent each sentence by summing the vectors&nbsp;of the words in that sentence. Like Chinea-Rios et al.,&nbsp;we use the k-means algorithm to cluster vectors. We&nbsp;set the number of clusters to 68. We refer to the&nbsp;evaluation measures used in (Le and Mikolov, 2014).&nbsp;We generate sets of three paragraphs: two with the&nbsp;same event type and one with a different event type.&nbsp;Each set is referred to as a paragraph triplet. The&nbsp;distance between the two vectors with the same event&nbsp;type should be closer than the distance between either&nbsp;of these two and the unrelated one. We collect 923&nbsp;paragraph triplets and compute the accuracy. Our best&nbsp;configuration that combines word dimensions and&nbsp;named entity dimensions to generate paragraph&nbsp;vectors achieves an accuracy of 62.49%,&nbsp;outperforming Chinea-Rios et al.’s pure text-clustering&nbsp;approach (M. Chinea-Rios et al., 2015) by 24.65%.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Analytics tool interface</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WeisoEvent groups paragraphs with similar subjects into clusters automatically and each cluster is&nbsp;named manually according to the main subject of its&nbsp;paragraphs. Clusters with related topics are grouped&nbsp;into broader categories for search convenience. For&nbsp;example, we group “earthquake”, “conflagration” and&nbsp;“hailstorm” into the event category “disaster”. Users&nbsp;can modify event category titles by clicking a button&nbsp;on the top-right of the webpage (see Fig. 1, [1])</span></p><img src="298_files/298-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:125pt;"/>
<p><span class="font4">Fig. 1 shows our research tool webpage, which consists of three main windows: (a) search&nbsp;parameters, (b) search result visualizations, and (c)&nbsp;search results snippets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search parameters: Users can search for one&nbsp;or more guards by typing the name into the&nbsp;search box (Fig. 1, [2]). For convenience, a&nbsp;user may also import a guard list by clicking&nbsp;the “import” icon (Fig. 1, [3]). Notably, if two&nbsp;guards are queried, their event timelines are&nbsp;displayed in parellel, like Jian-zhou (</span><span class="font3">®X</span><span class="font4">)&nbsp;and Wu-che (</span><span class="font3">X#</span><span class="font4">) guards shown in window&nbsp;b. After at least one event category is&nbsp;selected, the search results are shown in&nbsp;windows b and c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search result visualization tools: In window&nbsp;b, users can select among four visualization&nbsp;options at the top of the frame. Option 1&nbsp;hides or shows an event timeline of the&nbsp;search results on the page. When the event&nbsp;timeline is enabled, event-type labels&nbsp;corresponding to each retrieved paragraph&nbsp;are displayed chronologically on the&nbsp;timeline. For reference, the timeline shows&nbsp;the CE year at the bottom of the window (Fig.&nbsp;2, [4]) and the name of era, which usually&nbsp;corresponds with the reigning Ming&nbsp;emperor, at the top (Fig. 2, [5]). When a user&nbsp;clicks on an event icon in the timeline, the&nbsp;corresponding text snippet is displayed in&nbsp;window c, highlighted in yellow (Fig. 2).&nbsp;Figure 3 takes Jian-zhou guard (</span><span class="font3">WJ'Hffi</span><span class="font4">) as&nbsp;an example to depict options 2 to 4. Option 2&nbsp;is the bar chart. Each bar corresponds to a&nbsp;Chinese era name and represents the total&nbsp;number of paragraphs for the three selected&nbsp;event types in that era. Option 3 shows each&nbsp;bar sub-divided by color to show the&nbsp;distribution of paragraphs of each event type&nbsp;(“come over and pledge allegiance”/&nbsp;“reward alien”/ “tribute-reward”) in each&nbsp;era. By clicking Option 4, a pie chart shows&nbsp;the distribution of the three selected event&nbsp;types in the entire dataset. The slice for each&nbsp;event type is labeled with the number of&nbsp;paragraphs of that event type and its&nbsp;percentage of the total. These data&nbsp;visualizations offer historians a quick&nbsp;statistical overview of selected event types.</span></p><img src="298_files/298-2.jpg" style="width:241pt;height:91pt;"/>

<p><span class="font0">Figure 3. Data visualization options</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3. Search snippets: Text snippets of&nbsp;paragraphs related to the searched event&nbsp;types are displayed in window c (Figure 1,&nbsp;(c)). The results are organized in a table&nbsp;with columns (L-R) showing time, number&nbsp;of paragraphs, event type, and related&nbsp;paragraph snippets. All guard mentions in&nbsp;the texts are highlighted and linked to&nbsp;Academia Sinica's </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">CCTS-API Map Service</span><span class="font4"> .&nbsp;When a user clicks on a guard link in the&nbsp;text, the guard’s location will be shown on&nbsp;a map of Ming China in a pop-up window,&nbsp;see Fig. 4. It shows the locations of Wu-che&nbsp;guard (</span><span class="font3">X^W</span><span class="font4">) and Jian-zhou guard (W'li&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font4">) in the same map.</span></p><img src="298_files/298-4.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:152pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 4. Academia Sinica CCTS-API map service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally, we conduct a case study targeting Jurchens subordinated garrisons, including Wu-che guards (</span><span class="font3">X&nbsp;#§#W</span><span class="font4">) , Jian-zhou guards (</span><span class="font3">W'iB#W</span><span class="font4">), Mao-lian guard&nbsp;(</span><span class="font3">XWW</span><span class="font4">) by using the proposed tool to obtain statistics&nbsp;regarding tribute event types.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We compare our event classification results with Cheng’s study (N. Cheng, 2015), which used Ming Shilu&nbsp;as the source to investigate the tribute events during&nbsp;Yongle (</span><span class="font3">X^</span><span class="font4">), Hongxi (</span><span class="font3">^^</span><span class="font4">), and Xuande (</span><span class="font3">X^</span><span class="font4">)&nbsp;periods. We regard the paragraphs categorized as&nbsp;“tribute-reward”, “come over and pledge allegiance”,&nbsp;and “reward alien” event types as those potentially&nbsp;illustrating tribute events and manually check them.&nbsp;For Wu-che, Jian-zhou, and Mao-lian guards, 69, 86,&nbsp;and 40 paragraphs are identified as the above three&nbsp;types, respectively. Among these paragraphs, 66, 77,&nbsp;37 are correct, which are close to the numbers of&nbsp;tribute events in Cheng’s study for these three guards&nbsp;(60+, 70+, 30-). This study was done within 16 manhours. These preliminary results are consistent with&nbsp;Cheng’s manual analysis results and show that our tool&nbsp;not only helps historians study Weiso events more&nbsp;efficiently but also keep the quality.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
