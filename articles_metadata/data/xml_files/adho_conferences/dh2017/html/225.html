<p><span class="font2">One of the many challenges facing Digital Humanities projects today is how to design for&nbsp;alternative approaches to traditional close reading.&nbsp;Many of the current interface mechanisms for&nbsp;representing text are drawn from their print&nbsp;counterparts and are directly reflective of the&nbsp;analogue. These mechanisms rely upon traditional&nbsp;representations of text and typically structure content&nbsp;using techniques that have been leveraged by print for&nbsp;several centuries. However, these various mechanisms&nbsp;are designed to support traditional close reading&nbsp;techniques and often fail to consider digital reading&nbsp;methods. As digital content has become more&nbsp;ubiquitous and commonplace, a demographic shift has&nbsp;occurred, migrating readers towards alternative&nbsp;methods of reading and engagement with text,&nbsp;alternatives which seek to augment the traditional&nbsp;close reading approach. Previously conducted&nbsp;research shows a decline in traditional close reading&nbsp;techniques when moving from print to digital (Hayles,&nbsp;2012; Mangen, 2008). This, along with other factors,&nbsp;has led to the emergence of new methods of reading&nbsp;and textual engagement, such as hyper reading, radial&nbsp;reading, and distant reading (Hayles, 2012; McGann,&nbsp;2012; Moretti, 2013). However, finding metaphors or&nbsp;interactions which support these different modalities&nbsp;can be challenging, and the methods for discovering&nbsp;how users leverage content can often be inconsistent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In an effort to increase user experience within the Digital Humanities space, the field has turned to&nbsp;interaction design techniques in order to better&nbsp;understand how the user leverages these types of&nbsp;projects (Ruecker et al, 2011; Pierazzo, 2014).&nbsp;Traditionally, interaction design has borrowed from&nbsp;social science in an effort to create focus groups or&nbsp;usability studies which provide insight into how the&nbsp;user interacts with the software in question. Various&nbsp;techniques—such as ethnography, surveys, and&nbsp;interviews—are often leveraged with the goal of&nbsp;understanding how the individual engages with the&nbsp;software. However, these techniques typically fail to&nbsp;consider why the user may engage with the software&nbsp;in question. This assessment, otherwise known as the&nbsp;“emotional impact” of the software, can have&nbsp;tremendous impact upon the reader’s interaction with&nbsp;the content. Studies have shown that the subjective&nbsp;experience often has a strong impact upon&nbsp;metacognition (Ackerman &amp; Goldsmith, 2011), leading&nbsp;readers to demand more than just efficiency and&nbsp;usability from a platform: they also require emotional&nbsp;engagement (Shih and Liu, 2008). This poster&nbsp;proposes the “6 Point Story Method” as a framework&nbsp;which can be used to assess not only how the reader&nbsp;seeks to interact with the content but also why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “6 Point Story Method” is a psychological method developed by Alida Gersie. The method is&nbsp;primarily used by psychologists as a therapy modality&nbsp;to assist patients by framing stories which often have&nbsp;subconscious meaning and acting as an assistant to&nbsp;uncover issues requiring further therapeutic&nbsp;intervention (Dent-Brown and Wang, 2004). This&nbsp;poster proposes that this method can be adopted for&nbsp;use in the early stages of interaction design with the&nbsp;goal of facilitating idea generation in a group setting in&nbsp;order to further understand: the goals of end users,&nbsp;what challenges the users may face when navigating a&nbsp;software system, and the driving motivation behind&nbsp;the use of the platform (thus forming the emotional&nbsp;component of the analysis). This poster will discuss&nbsp;the use of the 6 Point Story Method within a focus&nbsp;group setting whose primary goal is to further explore&nbsp;how users wish to engage with Digital Humanities&nbsp;projects from non-traditional engagement methods&nbsp;(e.g. in support of reading modalities outside of&nbsp;traditional close reading). The methodology, including&nbsp;the demographics behind the focus groups, will be&nbsp;illustrated and the results will be explored in order to&nbsp;highlight the advantages of adapting the 6 Point Story&nbsp;Method to support traditional interaction design&nbsp;techniques.</span></p>
