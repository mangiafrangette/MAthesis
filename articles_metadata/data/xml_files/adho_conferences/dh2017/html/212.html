<p><span class="font3">This paper introduces the field of international textbook research and discusses how the WorldViews&nbsp;project is working towards enhanced access to&nbsp;textbook resources for digital humanities research.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Textbook Research</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The field of textbook research is one of the more recent and more diverse areas of academic&nbsp;investigation. The condensed and canonical character&nbsp;of the information selected for inclusion in textbooks -here understood as conventional textbooks - gives&nbsp;them central significance in academic, political and&nbsp;educational respects. Textbooks, as carriers of the&nbsp;knowledge and information that one generation&nbsp;wishes to pass on to the next, frequently find&nbsp;themselves at the center of political controversy. As&nbsp;such, their importance as an object of investigation in&nbsp;historical and cultural research has gained significant&nbsp;traction in recent decades. However, textbook&nbsp;research has not yet found dedicated representation&nbsp;as a main subject at universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a non-university institution, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">the Georg Eckert Institute</span><span class="font3"> (GEI) for International Textbook Research&nbsp;conducts and facilitates applied and multidisciplinary&nbsp;research into textbooks and educational media&nbsp;primarily informed by history and cultural studies. For&nbsp;this purpose, the GEI provides digital and social&nbsp;research infrastructure services such as its </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">renowned&nbsp;research library</span><span class="font3"> and various dedicated digital&nbsp;information services, such as </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Edumeres</span><span class="font3">, a virtual&nbsp;network with modules for specific aspects of textbook&nbsp;research. As such, the GEI realizes a unique position in&nbsp;the international field of textbook research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The study of textbooks has not only been facilitated by growing institutional support and infrastructure&nbsp;but also by the proliferation of new digital methods&nbsp;and resources in humanities research. In the digital&nbsp;humanities, the investigation of research questions is&nbsp;supported by a range of increasingly sophisticated&nbsp;digital methods such as automatic image and text&nbsp;analysis, linguistic text annotation, or data&nbsp;visualization. Digital tools and services combined with&nbsp;the increasing amount of resources available through&nbsp;digital libraries (such as the German Digital Library,&nbsp;the Deutsches Textarchiv, and Europeana) and&nbsp;research infrastructures (such as CLARIN or DARIAH)&nbsp;provide digital support for textbook analysis.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Digital Information Services</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At the GEI, the shift towards more digitally oriented research has resulted in a range of digital information&nbsp;services specifically tailored to textbook research.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">EurViews</span><span class="font3">, for example, is a multilingual digital&nbsp;platform containing primary sources from twentieth&nbsp;and twenty-first century history textbooks from&nbsp;around the world that manifest particular concepts of&nbsp;Europe and Europeanness (for example, see Gehler&nbsp;and Vietta, 2010; Best et al, 2012, and Chakrabarty,&nbsp;2000). The service also offers essays, commentaries,&nbsp;and educational histories written by designated&nbsp;experts in the field. EurViews is a useful tool for&nbsp;historians searching for relevant, reliable and hard-to-find research materials on topics related to textbooks.&nbsp;The materials may provide inspiration for research&nbsp;projects or be the starting point for more extensive&nbsp;searches for sources. EurViews also demonstrates that&nbsp;the printed monograph is no longer the dominant&nbsp;form of publication but that digital representation is&nbsp;gaining in importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Digital representations are increasingly becoming objects of investigation themselves. </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">GEI-Digital</span><span class="font3"> , for&nbsp;example, a digital library focusing on out-of-copyright&nbsp;works published between the inception of textbooks&nbsp;in the seventeenth century and the demise of imperial&nbsp;Germany in 1918, holds potentially relevant textual&nbsp;resources for EurViews. Other important information&nbsp;services provided by the GEI offer factual and&nbsp;bibliographic data relevant for textbook research:&nbsp;edu.data, for example, provides information about&nbsp;textbook systems in individual countries, and the&nbsp;library catalogue contains bibliographic metadata&nbsp;about textbooks from around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While these services all contain resources and information that are immediately relevant to textbook&nbsp;research, their content is frequently stored in isolated&nbsp;data silos that lack appropriate interfaces or&nbsp;standardized data models and which prevent&nbsp;convenient use or exchange of data within the GEI or&nbsp;with external services. For example, even though GEIDigital makes metadata about its resources available&nbsp;as METS/MODS encoded data via an OAI-PMH&nbsp;interface, EurViews lacks the interfaces that would&nbsp;enable it to utilize these full-text resources. Similarly,&nbsp;data on textbook systems from edu.data or&nbsp;bibliographic metadata from the library catalogue&nbsp;cannot be reused by existing or new research projects.&nbsp;External digital humanities infrastructures such as&nbsp;CLARIN-D are also unable to easily access texts stored&nbsp;in GEI-Digital or EurViews since those platforms&nbsp;contain plain text documents only which are not&nbsp;semantically annotated.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WorldViews</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">WorldViews project</span><span class="font3">, which is financed by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),&nbsp;addresses these challenges in order to further elevate&nbsp;access to textbook resources. Its aim being to enhance&nbsp;discoverability, reusability, and sustainability of&nbsp;textbook resources in cultural and historical research&nbsp;and in the digital humanities. The formative use case&nbsp;has been the digital platform for textbook sources,&nbsp;EurViews, a service that has proven to be in high&nbsp;demand- Since 2015 EurViews has had an average of&nbsp;400 visitors per month, a comparatively high number&nbsp;for this kind of digital academic service- and which&nbsp;constitutes one of the cornerstones of the GEI’s&nbsp;research infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two significant milestones have been achieved on the path to enhanced access. The first is the selection&nbsp;of the Text Encoding Initiative (</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">TEI)</span><span class="font3"> standard that will&nbsp;be used to encode the semantics of conventional&nbsp;textbook resources and thus facilitate access to fulltext sources. In addition, the Component MetaData&nbsp;Infrastructure (CMDI) framework has been chosen for&nbsp;the overall integration of metadata at the GEI; a&nbsp;framework also compatible with the CLARIN-D&nbsp;infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An extensive search for publicly available and dedicated encoding schemas for textual&nbsp;characteristics of conventional textbooks yielded no&nbsp;results. Therefore, a profile specifying the most&nbsp;relevant metadata and textual features in textbooks&nbsp;was developed from scratch after consulting&nbsp;historians at the GEI. The only viable option for&nbsp;creating an encoding schema based on the profile&nbsp;turned out to be the TEI encoding standard. The TEI&nbsp;schema created for textbooks focuses on basic&nbsp;elements for the selective and formal description of&nbsp;those structural and semantic features that are&nbsp;immediately relevant for WorldViews. For example,&nbsp;headings of sections or the semantics of particular&nbsp;paragraphs should provide the necessary semantics to&nbsp;enable retrieval scenarios to contextualize search&nbsp;results and to formulate more precise queries&nbsp;targeting particular segments of the text. This groundbreaking schema is designed to provide the nucleus&nbsp;for more comprehensive descriptions of whole&nbsp;textbooks, such as those found in GEI-Digital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Component MetaData Infrastructure (</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">CMDI</span><span class="font3">) provides a framework that allows blueprints of&nbsp;distinct metadata components to be defined and&nbsp;reused. CMDI allows standard metadata components&nbsp;to act as profiles for virtually any kind of metadata.&nbsp;CMDI profiles have been created to describe textbooks&nbsp;resources in WorldViews (we have switched to the&nbsp;new version of CMDI, released in mid-2016) and we&nbsp;are currently investigating their application in more&nbsp;fact-based resources such as edu.data. By using CMDI&nbsp;as a general framework for metadata descriptions,&nbsp;full-text resources can immediately be indexed by&nbsp;CLARIN’s </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtual Language Observatory</span><span class="font3"> and can be&nbsp;analyzed using its various tools and services such as&nbsp;Weblicht. The CMDI description of GEI resources&nbsp;allows for internally standardized search and retrieval&nbsp;operations in federated search scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second milestone for better access to textbook resources was the implementation of a logic tier.&nbsp;Central components of this tier are Solr-indices for&nbsp;federated searches, tools for handling digitization&nbsp;workflows, controlled metadata annotation and fulltext annotation of textbook sources and, significantly,&nbsp;a </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Fedora</span><span class="font3"> repository that will dynamically provide&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">access to standardized representations of textbook&nbsp;resources and other data from the various digital&nbsp;infrastructure services at the GEI for internal as well as&nbsp;external consumers. After extensive evaluation of similar&nbsp;repository software such as DSpace, Fedora was selected&nbsp;due to the greater customizability and flexibility offered by&nbsp;its strong modularity and existing applications with CMDI&nbsp;metadata. Furthermore, use of Fedora is a prerequisite for&nbsp;becoming a CLARIN center, one of the long-term objectives&nbsp;of the GEI. Through the logic tier digital platforms such as&nbsp;EurViews are able to send queries for bibliographic&nbsp;metadata on newly added textbooks directly to the library&nbsp;catalogue or they can directly reuse textbook resources&nbsp;from other systems such as GEI Digital or obtain contextual&nbsp;data from databases such as edu.data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Summary</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The WorldViews project has four main strategies aimed at improving overall access to digital textbook resources&nbsp;through enhanced reusability, discoverability and&nbsp;sustainability. These are a logic tier based on the Fedora&nbsp;repository, which mediates data between internal and&nbsp;external services; the digitization workflow tool Goobi,&nbsp;which controls metadata descriptions of digitized textbook&nbsp;resources; full-text encoding schemas based on TEI; and the&nbsp;metadata standardization based on the CMDI framework.&nbsp;WorldViews has laid the groundwork for standardized data&nbsp;models at full-text and metadata level in the field of textbook&nbsp;research; thereby providing a firm foundation for textbook&nbsp;resources and related data to be made accessible for digital&nbsp;humanities research.</span></p>
