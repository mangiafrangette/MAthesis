<p><span class="font2">Raboud University, the Netherlands</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Although the majority of Digital Humanities scholars still focus on textual analysis, we see an increasing number of studies using digitised visual sources and&nbsp;taking the first steps in the field of ‘Visual Big Data'&nbsp;(Ordelman et al, 2014). Scholars have increasingly&nbsp;used both large-scale digitised visual datasets as well&nbsp;as computational methods to analyse these datasets in&nbsp;new ways, see for example the work of Lev Manovich&nbsp;on Manga comics (2012), Time covers, and selfies (Ma-novich &amp; Tifentale 2015) or the recent work of Le-nardo et al (2016) on visual pattern discovery in large&nbsp;databases of paintings as presented at the DH 2016&nbsp;conference. Others focus on the identification of finding recurring images in visual collections. Terras &amp;&nbsp;Kirton (2013) analyse the reuse of digital images of&nbsp;cultural and heritage material on the internet while&nbsp;Resig (2014) and Reside (2015) follow a similar approach using a closed dataset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A similar trend can be observed at the ADHO Digital Humanities Conferences. In 2014 the special Interest&nbsp;group Audiovisual Materials in Digital Humanities was&nbsp;founded and at the 2015 and 2016 conferences, several papers were presented using (audio) visual&nbsp;sources (see e.g. Kleppe 2015, Lenardo et al. 2016, Lincoln 2016). Based on an analysis of the submissions&nbsp;for the 2017 conference, Scott Weingart observes that&nbsp;an increasing number of papers are based on research&nbsp;concerning non-textual sources (Weingart 2017). The&nbsp;use of non-textual sources challenges established research practices of Digital Humanities, leading to new&nbsp;research questions and the need for transformation of&nbsp;existing approaches, and the development of new&nbsp;methodologies. For example, how can we analyse the&nbsp;characteristics of images in large visual datasets?&nbsp;Some of these questions have also been raised in the&nbsp;analogue era. See, for example, the work of Barry Salt&nbsp;(1974) on the characteristics of opening shots of twentieth-century films, Scott McCloud (1994) on the visual&nbsp;language of Japanese manga and comics, or Peter&nbsp;Burke's take on using visual materials as historical evidence (2001).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Due to the digital turn, we now see the application of new techniques to answer similar and new types of&nbsp;research questions. One of the dominant techniques to&nbsp;analyse large-scale visual datasets is computer vision:&nbsp;a field that deals with how computers can generate a&nbsp;high-level of understanding of visual material&nbsp;(Smeulders 2000).This field has been seeing unprecedented improvements as part of the “Deep Learning&nbsp;Revolution” since the first deep Convolutional Neural&nbsp;Network (Krizhevsky 2012), unleashing new possibilities. This workshop will focus on how computer vision can be applied within the realm of Audiovisual&nbsp;Materials in Digital Humanities. During the workshop,&nbsp;attendees will both present (ongoing) work on applying computer vision and experiment with computer vision in their own work in a hands-on session. Possible&nbsp;questions include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font2">What are state-of-art techniques in computer vision?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font2">What are possibilities and challenges in the application of computer vision in Digital Humanities research?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font2">How can non-expert researchers employ computer vision?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font2">How can cooperation between Humanities researchers and computer vision experts be&nbsp;improved so both can benefit of each other's&nbsp;expertise?</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Workshop outline</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The workshop will consist of four pillars:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A keynote </span><span class="font2">by </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lindsay King</span><span class="font2"> (Associate Director for Access and Research Services Robert&nbsp;B. Haas Family Arts Library, Yale University)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&amp; </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Peter Leonard</span><span class="font2"> (Director Digital Humanities Lab, Yale University Library) &amp; on “Processing Pixels: Towards Visual Culture Computation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Paper presentations </span><span class="font2">with results and ongoing work on applying computer vision in DH&nbsp;research projects. Papers will be selected by&nbsp;a review commission. All details on the Call&nbsp;for Abstracts can be found at the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">workshop&nbsp;website</span><span class="font2">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A hands-on session </span><span class="font2">in which participants&nbsp;will be able to experiment with open source&nbsp;Computer Vision tools. This session will be&nbsp;led b</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">y Benoit Seguin</span><span class="font2"> of École Polytechnique&nbsp;Fédérale de Lausanne, (EPFL). Benoit Seguin is a PhD Student in Computer Science&nbsp;from the DHLAB at EPFL. His work focuses&nbsp;on automatic patterns detection across icon-ographic collections. Before starting his PhD,&nbsp;he worked with microscope images for biomedical applications or electronic manufacturing problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Lightning Talks </span><span class="font2">allowing participants to&nbsp;share their ideas, projects or ongoing work&nbsp;in a short presentation of two minutes. Interested researchers who want to present work&nbsp;will be able to submit their idea in a later&nbsp;stage.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SIG Endorsement</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">This workshop proposal is endorsed by the steering committee of the Special Interest Group </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Audiovisual Materials in the Digital Humanities (AVinDH).</span><span class="font2"> This will be the third workshop that will be organised by&nbsp;the SIG. The </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">first workshop</span><span class="font2"> on audiovisual material in&nbsp;digital humanities took place at the 2014 DH Conference in Lausanne. This workshop paved the way for&nbsp;the foundation of the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">AVinDH Special Interest Group&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">that was officially launched during the DH2015 Conference in Sydney. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">The second workshop</span><span class="font2"> took place&nbsp;during the DH2016 Conference in Cracow and dealt&nbsp;with audiovisual material and dedicated analysis tools&nbsp;in DH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the previous SIG-endorsed workshops were organised by the SIG's steering committee, this proposal on Computer Vision in Digital Humanities is&nbsp;mainly organised by members of the SIG and one representative of the Steering Committee. The steering&nbsp;committee applauds the initiative of the organisers&nbsp;since the theme of the workshop fits perfect in both</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the SIG's aims as well as the current interest in nontextual sources as observed by </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Scott Weingart in his first analyses of the DH2017 submissions</span><span class="font2">. Furthermore, the steering committee is enthusiastic about&nbsp;providing a platform for members of the SIG and the&nbsp;complete DH community to present high-quality work&nbsp;that will be selected by a review committee as well as&nbsp;ongoing work that will be presented in lighting talks.&nbsp;Both formats will contribute to the community and&nbsp;network building function that the SIG AVinDH promotes.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Programme Committee</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The programme committee (PC) for this workshop consists of the workshop proposers (see list with&nbsp;names and bios below).
