<p><span class="font1">Reading, writing, and discussion are the most common—and, most would agree, the most&nbsp;valuable—components of a university-level&nbsp;humanities seminar. In humanities courses, all three&nbsp;activities can be guided and supported with a variety&nbsp;of digital and analog tools. Digital texts can create&nbsp;novel opportunities for teaching and learning,&nbsp;particularly when students’ reading activity is made&nbsp;visible to other members of the course. In this short&nbsp;paper, we will introduce </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lacuna</span><span class="font1">, a web-based&nbsp;platform which hosts digital course materials to be&nbsp;read and annotated socially and collaboratively. We&nbsp;report these findings in relation to an observational&nbsp;case study of four different humanities courses at&nbsp;California community colleges using Lacuna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lacuna is the result of a collaborative and iterative effort at Stanford to design a platform that supports&nbsp;the practices of critical reading and dialogue in&nbsp;humanities courses. On Lacuna, which uses Drupal to&nbsp;manage content, course syllabus materials are&nbsp;digitized and uploaded to the platform. These&nbsp;materials can be organized by topic, class date, and&nbsp;other metadata such as medium (text, video, or audio).&nbsp;When students and instructors open up materials,&nbsp;they can digitally annotate selections from any text&nbsp;using a pop-up javascript annotator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Annotation on Lacuna is a social as well as an individual practice, leveraging the participatory&nbsp;possibilities of web-based technologies. Lacuna users&nbsp;can choose to share annotations with one another and&nbsp;hover over highlighted passages to reveal others’&nbsp;comments or questions. Social annotation makes&nbsp;explicit and visible for students the broad array of&nbsp;annotation practices within an interpretive&nbsp;community such as a classroom and helps students cocreate interpretations of texts. Students’ annotation&nbsp;activity on Lacuna is also made visible through a&nbsp;separate instructor dashboard, which helps&nbsp;instructors track engagement throughout the course.&nbsp;Finally, annotations can be connected across texts&nbsp;using the “Sewing Kit” in order to support intertextual&nbsp;analyses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After introducing the features of the platform, we present a case study of the use of Lacuna in four&nbsp;California community-college classes. As part of a U.S.&nbsp;Department of Education Title VI grant, we worked&nbsp;with faculty from Foothill College, De Anza College,&nbsp;and College of San Mateo to incorporate Lacuna into&nbsp;their lesson plans and classroom pedagogy. Drawing&nbsp;on ethnographic methods, we describe how the faculty&nbsp;members used the platform’s affordances to integrate&nbsp;students’ online activity into course planning and&nbsp;seminar discussions and activities. We also explore&nbsp;students’ experience of social annotation and social&nbsp;reading, insights gathered from surveys, interviews,&nbsp;and classroom observation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In our case study, we find that student annotations and writing on Lacuna give instructors more insight&nbsp;into students’ perspectives on texts and course&nbsp;materials. The visibility of shared annotations&nbsp;encourages students to take on a more active role as&nbsp;peer instructors and peer learners. Our short talk will&nbsp;close with a discussion of the new responsibilities,&nbsp;workflows, and demands on self-reflection introduced&nbsp;by these altered relationships between course&nbsp;participants. People at our talk will learn about the&nbsp;benefits and challenges encountered in using Lacuna,&nbsp;which are likely to be shared by individuals using&nbsp;other learning technologies with similar goals and&nbsp;features. We will also consider future directions for&nbsp;the enhancement of teaching and learning through the&nbsp;use of social reading and digital annotation.</span></p>
