<p><span class="font4">Digital Humanities (hereafter - DH) recently became almost the most dynamically developing direction in the Humanities despite the Humanities crisis and scaling-down of Humanities studies in universities and academic centers all over the world. It is not&nbsp;only the transformation in Humanities that leads to&nbsp;this. Significant improvements in algorithms and computational tools that are being used for complex data,&nbsp;as well as social connections via new understandings&nbsp;of language, culture, and history also influence these&nbsp;phenomena. These up-to-date technologies, in addition to appealing to the natural sciences and mathematical knowledge, enhance the status of DH among&nbsp;the scientific community and broaden the opportunities for its rapid development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time, we still witness heated debates about the opportunities and perspectives of DH as a&nbsp;research field (Gold and Klein, 2016). The papers published in 2015-2016 emphasize the DH research priorities such as data analysis and data visualization, studying the creative process of software developers and&nbsp;so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Striving for a clear picture of DH development, one should study how dynamic the development of the DH&nbsp;infrastructure and its information environment are.&nbsp;That is the objective of the present study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To collect the data for the study we performed the search queries in the Internet engines with the key&nbsp;word “digital humanities” in 6 European and 4 Eastern&nbsp;languages using some automated frameworks. This&nbsp;linguistic diversity the result of preliminary research&nbsp;that has shown that many DH units have their web&nbsp;sites in a national language alone. We processed 4000&nbsp;search results via content analysis with the help of&nbsp;«Statistica v6.1.Ru» specialized software, Microsoft&nbsp;Access and MySQL databases, and ArcGIS. As a result,&nbsp;we have defined 430 science and education organizations these results lead to. These organizations/ units&nbsp;are active in various areas in Humanities and declare&nbsp;themselves as those related to DH (or we have defined&nbsp;them as such having analyzed their websites).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This DH information environment study is based on the analysis of the types of information interactions&nbsp;that appear in DH and form its information environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An analysis of the verified empirical data allowed the authors to define the organizational forms of the&nbsp;DH science and education units, the main research directions, and localize these units connecting them to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the map of the world. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">map</span><span class="font4"> (open for update) has been designed via an open online tool Google My Maps&nbsp;(Department of Informatics Problems of the Humanities, 2017)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before designing the interactive map, we developed the DH centre database including such fields as title, address, abstract, and information about the unit&nbsp;head, website, contacts, and date of foundation. ArcGIS&nbsp;allows us to automatically process the data on the map&nbsp;according to the database fields and visualize the&nbsp;search results, providing an understandable picture of&nbsp;the digital humanities across the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results of the preliminary study performed in 2015 have been published earlier (Mozhaeva et al,&nbsp;2016). In the present paper we focused on DH units&nbsp;rather than on papers, extended the data and updated&nbsp;it (as of August 2016). We have extended the number&nbsp;of resources, languages and DH units, finished an interactive map of DH centres and a catalogue of open&nbsp;access software for DH studies that are going to simplify the search for new partners, developing network&nbsp;projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those 430 units in 42 countries that we have found are spread over the world (Figure 1):</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">in Europe: 174 units, mostly in Great Britain (27), France (25), Germany (21) and Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(17);</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">in Asia: 65 units, mostly in Japan (33) and China (16);</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">in North America: 9 units, including 7 in Brazil and 2 in Argentina;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">in Pacific basin countries and Australia: 17 units (11 in Australia and 6 in New Zealand);</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">in Africa: 5 units (Republic of South Africa).</span></p><img src="427_files/427-1.jpg" style="width:230pt;height:132pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. Interactive map of DH centres (screenshot)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mostly widespread unit types are centres (139 units that is 32%), laboratories (67 units i.e. 16%), institutes (59 units, 14%) and university units (departments, subdivisions, faculties, schools) (57 units,&nbsp;13%). There are 14 “groups”, 13 “initiatives” and 13&nbsp;‘societies” that give 3% of the general number of units&nbsp;that have been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dynamics of creating the DH units shows that about 20% of them have been created in the 1960-80's&nbsp;at the major universities as centres for the Humanities&nbsp;research that were positioned as DH units in 19902000. About 25% of the studied units have been created in the 1990’s, 39% - in the 2000’s, 16% - in the&nbsp;2010's. A steady increase in the number of DH units is&nbsp;observed since the mid 2000’s. In the 2010’s there is&nbsp;active institutionalization of DH: permanent organizations, educational and research units (centre, laboratory, institution, department, chair, school) at major&nbsp;universities, research institutions, etc. are being established. Among the studied 430 DH units such units&nbsp;amount to more than 75%. At the same time, the number of temporary units and teams (projects, groups, initiatives, etc.) created to solve specific problems is being reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a growing attention to the educational activities in the field of DH (masters and postgraduate programs, short-term training and courses), which is&nbsp;typical for 26% of the studied DH units. The applied</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">developments are becoming more and more important:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">22% of the studied units develop and introduce new digital tools, methods and models;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">27% of units provide a variety of digital resources, services and platforms, mobile applications, multimedia systems, 3D-models,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GIS objects, etc.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">7% of units develop online tools for learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The analysis of the main directions of scientific and educational activities in the field of DH found that in&nbsp;the number of the DH units the focus is not only on the&nbsp;use of digital tools, but also on the study of the results&nbsp;of their application, the impact on the transformation&nbsp;of learning processes in the field of the Humanities and&nbsp;social sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We spotted researchers’ consolidation in the framework of this research field, as well as the development of common principles, methods and scientific&nbsp;digital tools. We revealed 28 network associations (association, network, platform, consortium, alliance)&nbsp;that are both national and international, mostly continental and transcontinental (Mozhaeva et al, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The development of DH network infrastructure goes along with the extension of information interactions among specialists from diverse DH units worldwide. The infrastructure of DH centres reflects the&nbsp;units of the DH information environment. The increasing trend of centres comes with the trend for extension&nbsp;of the information environment and of those information interactions that build it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another trend in DH is intercultural information interactions that might become real during face-to-face meeting at the international conferences, workshops,&nbsp;seminars and so on, or continue virtually via the Internet technologies video presentations, webinars, forums, social networks, blogs and others. It is worth&nbsp;mentioning that virtual communication is very common for DH (it is possible via virtual research environments, communities, networks and associations, specialized online resources, services and platforms,&nbsp;Skype, blogs, forums, publications and discussions in&nbsp;social networks). Studying that type of interactions allows us to model the DH information environment and&nbsp;forecast the perspectives of this multidisciplinary&nbsp;field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An example of today’s indicator of the intense and effective information interactions in DH environment&nbsp;is for instance a growth in number of blogs, e-journals&nbsp;and pages devoted to the DH, as well as number of subscribers to these editions. The social networks analysis (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube,&nbsp;VK) shows that the most popular and ever-growing&nbsp;platform for DH is Twitter. The number of subscribers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to @DHQuarterly and @DHNow on Twitter is 7,034 and 23,6 thousand people accordingly in August 2016.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The study that we performed allowed us to see the scale of the extension of digital humanities, visualize&nbsp;and localize 430 DH units, classify the major directions&nbsp;of their activity. The interactive map of DH centres extends the opportunities for research communication,&nbsp;facilitates setting the conditions for integrative processes in the development of Digital Humanities, as&nbsp;well as launching multidisciplinary and international&nbsp;research and educational projects. We consider the&nbsp;growing number of DH centres, as well as the qualitative change in their activity and expansion of the information environment, as evidence of the dynamic development of this field.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgements</span></h1>
