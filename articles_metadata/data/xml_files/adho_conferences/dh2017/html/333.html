<p><span class="font3">How do people look at and experience art? Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on? Do&nbsp;museum labels have an impact on how people look at&nbsp;artworks? The viewing experience of art is a complex&nbsp;one, involving issues of perception, attention, memory,&nbsp;decision-making, affect, and emotion. Thus, the time it&nbsp;takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork&nbsp;can inform about its relevance, interestingness, and&nbsp;even its aesthetic appeal. This paper describes a&nbsp;collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique&nbsp;collection of 17th Century Zurbaran paintings. The&nbsp;Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example&nbsp;of a continental collection preserved in situ in&nbsp;purpose-built surroundings. While studies of the&nbsp;psychology of art have focused on individual works&nbsp;and distinctions between representative/non-representative topics, no work has been completed on&nbsp;the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of&nbsp;devotional themes. In this paper, we report upon the&nbsp;novel insights eye-tracking techniques have provided&nbsp;into the unconscious processes of viewing the unique&nbsp;collection of Zurbaran artworks. The purpose of this&nbsp;pilot study was to assess the effects of different&nbsp;written interpretation on the visual exploration of&nbsp;artworks. We will discuss the potential implications of&nbsp;these techniques and our understanding of visual&nbsp;behaviours on museum and gallery practice. The&nbsp;project brings together established research strengths&nbsp;in Spanish art history, experimental psychology,&nbsp;digital humanities, and museum studies to explore,&nbsp;using eye-tracking techniques, aesthetic reactions to&nbsp;digital representations of the individual Zurbaran&nbsp;artworks as well as the significance of the collection as&nbsp;a whole.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Overview</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes; the&nbsp;beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork.&nbsp;When regarding an artwork, a viewer gathers&nbsp;information through a series fixations, interspersed by&nbsp;rapid movements of the eye called saccades. The&nbsp;direction of saccades is determined by an interaction&nbsp;between the goals of the observer and the physical&nbsp;properties of the different elements of the scene (e.g.&nbsp;colour, texture, brightness etc). Importantly, studying&nbsp;eye movements offers an insight that does not depend&nbsp;on the participants’ beliefs, memories or subjective&nbsp;impressions of the artwork. Previous eye tracking&nbsp;research has highlighted the potential to transform the&nbsp;ways we understand visual processing in the arts (see&nbsp;for example Brieber 2014; Binderman et al., 2005) and&nbsp;at the same time offers a direct way of studying several&nbsp;important factors of a museum visit (Filippini Fantoni&nbsp;et al., 2013; Heidenreich &amp; Turano 2011; Milekic&nbsp;2010).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zurbaran’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over&nbsp;250 years. It is the only cycle to be preserved in&nbsp;purpose-built surroundings in the UK, and one of very&nbsp;few of its kind in the world. It has a long history in&nbsp;scholarship (Baron &amp; Beresford 2014), but many key&nbsp;aspects of its production and significance have not yet&nbsp;been fully understood. In this study we used eyetracking in the first stage of exploring audience&nbsp;experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of&nbsp;County Durham, of which the 13 Zurbaran artworks&nbsp;(there are actually only 12 Zurbaran artworks, the&nbsp;13 th Benjamin, is a copy by Arthur Pond) are a key&nbsp;part of, to investigate the ways in which audiences&nbsp;look at Spanish art, how aesthetic experience is&nbsp;evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged&nbsp;to approach art in different ways. This pilot project&nbsp;primarily investigated how participants visually&nbsp;explore artworks and provides new insights into the&nbsp;potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we&nbsp;understand visual processing in arts and culture and&nbsp;at the same time offer a direct way of studying several&nbsp;important factors of a museum visit, namely to assess&nbsp;the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual&nbsp;behaviour.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The aim of this study was to determine whether the accompanying written context influences how digital&nbsp;artworks are visually experienced. Whether&nbsp;contextual information impacts on where participants&nbsp;first look (first fixation), if gallery labels influence the&nbsp;time participants choose to view artworks and,&nbsp;especially, whether it influences their aesthetic&nbsp;appreciation of the works. We expected viewing time&nbsp;for artworks and corresponding labels to be predicted&nbsp;by participants’ subjective experiences, artwork&nbsp;related features, and contextual factors. Accordingly,&nbsp;we measured viewing time, fixation, and saccades for&nbsp;each artwork and corresponding label using a fixed&nbsp;eye tracking technology (</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tobii TX300)</span><span class="font3"> in a laboratory&nbsp;setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Forty Six students from the University of Durham participated in this study. All participants had normal&nbsp;or corrected vision, no formal training in arts or art&nbsp;history and received course credit for taking part. All&nbsp;participants gave informed consent. The study was&nbsp;approved by Durham University’s Department of&nbsp;Psychology Ethics committee. A third of the&nbsp;participants were randomly assigned to the Museum&nbsp;Context group (nMC =16), who inspected digital&nbsp;images of the paintings in conjunction with the&nbsp;contextualizing labels currently in use at Auckland&nbsp;Castle, which rely heavily on relating the content of&nbsp;individual compositions to the words of Jacob in&nbsp;Genesis 49; a third to the Aesthetic Context group (nAC&nbsp;= 15), who received labels foregrounding issues of&nbsp;aesthetic and interpretive interest; and the final third&nbsp;to the No Context group (nNC = 15), who received only&nbsp;basic attribution data: title of composition, name and&nbsp;date of artist, date of composition, and nature of&nbsp;medium (i.e. “oil on canvas”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All stimuli were taken from Auckland Castle’s collection of Jacob and his Twelve Sons by Francisco&nbsp;de Zurbarán. Each participant viewed high-resolution&nbsp;digital reproductions of the original artworks&nbsp;presented on the Tobii TX300 screen based&nbsp;eyetracker. The stimuli were presented in the same&nbsp;sequence for all participants.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Previous authors have shown that when a human being is portrayed in a painting, gazing behaviour is&nbsp;mostly focused on the human figure, independently of&nbsp;contextual elements also depicted in the image. In&nbsp;particular, attention is given to the face area, and it&nbsp;plays a fundamental role in aesthetic judgment (Ro et&nbsp;al., 2007; Massaro et al., 2012; Villani et al., 2015).&nbsp;Given these considerations, three key regions of&nbsp;interest (ROI) were identified; the head, the clothes&nbsp;and the contextualising element. Saccades and&nbsp;fixations were identified offline in Tobii Studio using&nbsp;the default algorithm (onset/offset criterion of 70&nbsp;degrees/second and a minimum dwell time of 80ms).&nbsp;The key variables of interest for each ROI were (1)&nbsp;Frequency of First Fixation, (2) Time to First Fixation&nbsp;and (3) Total Fixation Duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When comparing the first fixation data across the three participant groups (Museum Context group&nbsp;(MC), Aesthetic Context group (AC) and No Context&nbsp;group (NC)), it possible to see an interesting trend (Fig&nbsp;1) that suggests that contextual labelling appears to&nbsp;change the proportion of participants fixating on the&nbsp;face. The study revealed that the AC labels succeeded&nbsp;in disbursing the gaze more effectively than those that&nbsp;are current MC labels. In all thirteen paintings,&nbsp;evidence shows that participant visual behaviour&nbsp;changed in response to the written interpretation.&nbsp;This suggests that an aesthetic context labelling&nbsp;approach is more successful in stimulating and/or&nbsp;training the gaze than one rooted in theological&nbsp;extrapolation.</span></p><img src="333_files/333-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:104pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: Graph highlighting the proportion of viewing time spent fixating on the face</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pilot study also found that contextual labelling has a significant effect on influencing levels of&nbsp;aesthetic appreciation, and on the ways in which the&nbsp;gaze can be trained and/or manipulated to engage&nbsp;with areas of interest that would otherwise be&nbsp;overlooked. Reorienting the content of individual&nbsp;labels away from scripture and towards questions of&nbsp;aesthetics and interpretation produced a statistically&nbsp;significant reduction in aesthetic appreciation, which,&nbsp;given that the face is a key driver of aesthetic&nbsp;judgements, is consistent with the finding that the&nbsp;aesthetic context also reduced the participants dwell&nbsp;time on the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper will also discuss a how participants identify and rank the artworks in terms of authenticity&nbsp;and value. By ranking compositions, we will crossreference attitudes with the prices (all different) paid&nbsp;by Bishop Trevor at auction in 1756, considering how&nbsp;aesthetic tastes have changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Summary and Conclusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To date, studies of museum and gallery visitor behaviour primarily investigate how people&nbsp;behaviourally and cognitively respond to the design&nbsp;and layout of exhibits. However, they largely ignore&nbsp;the behavioural responses at the ‘exhibit- face’ (vom&nbsp;Lehn and Heath 2006) or the ‘fat moment’ (Garfinkel&nbsp;1967) of visitors’ action. Eye-tracking techniques&nbsp;have provided novel insights into the unconscious&nbsp;viewing processes of the ‘fat moment’ of the unique&nbsp;collection of Zurbaran artworks. The study highlighted&nbsp;statistically significant variations in levels of aesthetic&nbsp;appreciation. More importantly, the experiments&nbsp;indicated that by changing the written interpretation&nbsp;gaze can be redirected towards areas of conceptual&nbsp;significance, challenging the face bias which&nbsp;traditionally plays a fundamental role in aesthetic&nbsp;judgment.</span></p>
