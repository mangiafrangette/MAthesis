<p><span class="font3">Humanities scholars have historically used archives that include restricted or privacy-sensitive collections in order to conduct their investigations about sensitive topics. The recent developments in digitization and dissemination technologies present the possibility of making archival collections broadly available. Furthermore, collections of new, born-digital documents will be readily available to support and enhance scholarship. However, such access has also exacerbated threats to the privacy of individuals named&nbsp;in these records. Examples of such privacy-sensitive&nbsp;records include mental health institutional records,&nbsp;prison records, records of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Nazi archives, and the Guatemalan&nbsp;police archives. In the physical world, access to these&nbsp;records is protected by distance, physical access, and&nbsp;a variety of national and local statutes. The legal&nbsp;framework for digital records is substantially behind&nbsp;that for physical records. Furthermore, the online&nbsp;availability of such records has a potential to stigmatize or embarrass the families or descendants of those&nbsp;named in the records when they bear no responsibility&nbsp;for the acts or afflictions of the named individuals,&nbsp;raising ethical issues in providing broad, open access&nbsp;to these records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The organizers are studying the legal, conceptual, and practical issues in harnessing such privacy-sensitive collections in the service of scholarship—for example in history (of medicine and mental health), law,&nbsp;and social services. Our research is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (grant number:&nbsp;11500653) under the scholarly communications program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This workshop will invite broad participation from scholars and practitioners who work with or are interested in issues surrounding humanities scholarship&nbsp;supported or enhanced by digital, privacy-sensitive&nbsp;collections. A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest&nbsp;include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Digitization, curation, and preservation of&nbsp;privacy-sensitive collections</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Theoretical and metadata models</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Policies, workflows, and protections for accessing materials</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Issues in using cloud services for privacy-sensitive materials storage and scholarship</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Scholarly information behavior and needs</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Models for balancing privacy of named entities versus access to specific demographics</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Mechanisms and models for data retrieval&nbsp;from handwrittendocuments</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Evaluation of existing software, infrastructure, and techniques</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Social justice issues and non-scholarly outcomes of work with restricted collections</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Workshop organizers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Unmil P. Karadkar</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unmil P. Karadkar is an assistant professor in the School of Information at The University of Texas at&nbsp;Austin. He situates his work at the intersection of digital libraries, human-computer interaction, and visualization. He studies data practices of researchers with&nbsp;an eye toward identifying unmet information needs.&nbsp;Based on an understanding of these needs, he designs&nbsp;software to support their evolving practices and evaluates the impact of this software on their work. His research contributes to areas such as the design of digital collection interfaces and digital humanities. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Texas General Land Office, USAA, and most recently, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This is our first workshop on this topic and we are unsure what the interest will be. In this light, we have&nbsp;tried to make the topic as broad as possible, while retaining the core characteristics and constraints that&nbsp;we have found in our work. Our poster at DH 2014 was&nbsp;well-received and several conference attendees expressed an interest as well as challenges in working&nbsp;with collections similar to ours. The collections they&nbsp;described were geographically and topically diverse.&nbsp;With this experience, we anticipate receiving 10 to 20&nbsp;submissions and accepting 8 to 10 for presentation at&nbsp;the workshop. We are unable to gauge the level of interest in the DH community in attending the workshop&nbsp;without presenting.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Length and format</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">We propose to hold our workshop for one day. This time frame will allow for adequate exploration of the&nbsp;various aspects of the workshop topics as well as domains via presentations, as well as in-depth discussion. We are open to conducting the workshop on a&nbsp;single day or as two half days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The workshop will be held in a seminar style, with several short and long presentations. Individuals may&nbsp;participate in the workshop without presenting. The&nbsp;organizers will include an open discussion time to engage the audience and, especially, to tease out aspects&nbsp;of scholarship with privacy-sensitive digital collections that the presentations do not cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Program Committee</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We will assemble a diverse program committee that includes scholars and practitioners with a diverse&nbsp;expertise. Potential invitees include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">Tom Cramer, Assistant University Librarian-Library Technology, Stanford University</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">Karen Estlund, Associate Dean for Technology and Digital Strategies, Penn State University Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">Donald Fyson, Professor-History, Universite Laval</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">Pat Galloway, Professor-Information Studies, The University of Texas at Austin Gary Geisler, UX Designer, Stanford University Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">Geoffrey Rockwell, Professor-Philoshophy and Humanities Computing, University of Alberta Martin Summers, Associate Professor-History, Boston College</span></p>
