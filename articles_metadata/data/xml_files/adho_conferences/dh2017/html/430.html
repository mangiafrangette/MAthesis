<p><span class="font2">This panel explores the use of digital, rare book catalogs as platforms for collaboration and as sources&nbsp;of data to uncover patterns of book production and to&nbsp;offer new insights into the sociology of texts.&nbsp;Extractions from and additions to bibliographic data&nbsp;extend the catalog beyond its original use as a point of&nbsp;access and discovery. The use of catalogs as sources of&nbsp;bibliographic big data as well as the use of platforms&nbsp;that enable bibliographic record annotation allow us&nbsp;to reimagine the catalog’s trajectories of creation and&nbsp;utility. Considering the genealogy of the catalog, the&nbsp;panel will examine how research practices have both&nbsp;informed and been informed by catalogs since their&nbsp;inception and how the work of bibliography is&nbsp;reimagined in the catalog. Focusing on how limitations&nbsp;and aporia in the catalog can lead to critical making in&nbsp;the digital age, the panel will show how digital uses of&nbsp;the catalog currently enable mindful interrogation of&nbsp;catalog data and catalog making as well as consider&nbsp;possibilities for expanded use of rare book catalog&nbsp;data in the future. This consideration of the rare book&nbsp;catalog as a digital humanities project invites&nbsp;reassessment of legacy information architecture as&nbsp;well as the many hands that built the bibliographic&nbsp;structures on which so much of the work of the digital&nbsp;humanities rests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In “Towards Speculative Catalogs,” Dawn Childress will open with a discussion of the transformative&nbsp;promise of the digital as we reconstruct catalogs in&nbsp;new forms and formats. To provide context for critical&nbsp;catalog constructions more broadly, Childress will&nbsp;highlight how bibliographies and catalogs have served&nbsp;as source material for research beyond that of points&nbsp;of access in both pre- and post-DH contexts, as well as&nbsp;consider how digital humanities use cases might differ&nbsp;from more analog approaches, whether qualitative or&nbsp;quantitative. In addressing these questions, Childress&nbsp;will explore the promise of applying current and&nbsp;emerging tools and standards (such as linked data,&nbsp;IIIF, PCDM, etc.) to the practice of interrogating&nbsp;bibliographic and catalog data. Childress will suggest&nbsp;how we might leverage these systems to record and&nbsp;analyze lacunae, erasures, and bias in capturing the&nbsp;bibliographic record and, drawing on Bethany&nbsp;Nowviskie’s notion of speculative collections, how&nbsp;these systems might support active reframing and&nbsp;interrogation by users.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In “‘The Technology of Shared Cataloging’: A Retrospective,” Molly O’Hagan Hardy will build on&nbsp;Childress’s remarks through a close look at the&nbsp;creation and re-creation of two rare book union&nbsp;catalogs: the English Short Title Catalog (ESTC) and&nbsp;the North American Imprints Program (NAIP). In&nbsp;1981, in a Bibliographic Society of America&nbsp;Symposium from which the title of Hardy’s paper&nbsp;takes its name, William Todd wrote, “Perhaps we do&nbsp;not yet fully appreciate the situation, now rapidly&nbsp;materializing, whereby computers converse with each&nbsp;other in any mode, while the rest of us, mere mortals,&nbsp;stand mute before them.” Remarks like this, which&nbsp;abound in the excitement and trepidation expressed&nbsp;during the emergence of these rare book union&nbsp;catalogs, echo a similar exuberance and hesitancy&nbsp;around the transformation from MARC to linked data&nbsp;models. Examining what “machine readable” meant&nbsp;then and means now, Hardy will draw parallels&nbsp;between the current conversation around BIBFRAME&nbsp;and other such initiatives and those early efforts led by&nbsp;Robin Alston and Marcus McCorison to amass large&nbsp;amounts of special collections’ catalog data. She will&nbsp;then examine what it was these catalogs set out to&nbsp;capture and in what ways this work is being&nbsp;reimagined in the linked open data environment. She&nbsp;will do this through a close look at the American&nbsp;Antiquarian Society’s Printers’ File linked data project&nbsp;and its reliance on LCNAF and VIAF to merge MARC&nbsp;data with BIBFRAME. Ultimately, she will consider&nbsp;how such initiatives necessitate the reimagining of&nbsp;library and scholarly work, so those working on both&nbsp;sides of the reference desk are not left to “stand mute”&nbsp;before their creations. Hardy will point to examples of&nbsp;innovative uses of rare book catalog data for digital&nbsp;humanities projects. Such uses, Hardy will show, not&nbsp;only prove efficient and effective means of generating&nbsp;data, but they also productively unearth biases&nbsp;inherent in any information system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Paige Morgan will conclude our presentations with “Searching For Common Ground: Modeling&nbsp;Bibliographic Data in Library and DH Contexts,” in&nbsp;which she will present the results of a survey of data&nbsp;use in DH projects examining the projects’ use and&nbsp;presentation of library data (including bibliographic&nbsp;data and data presented in digital collections&nbsp;platforms). This survey will focus on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">whether each project includes bibliographic&nbsp;references;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">how much granular detail any bibliographic&nbsp;references include,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">whether or not such data is presented in the&nbsp;format of a specific model, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the presence or absence of links to specific&nbsp;copies, whether in library or digital archive&nbsp;catalogs (such as HathiTrust, the ESTC,&nbsp;paywalled collections (ECCO, EEBO, etc.), or&nbsp;websites like Google Books and Project&nbsp;Gutenberg).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gathering this data will allow Morgan to look for common priorities in the project creators’ use of&nbsp;library data; and to identify some of the assumptions&nbsp;that digital humanities has made about libraries and&nbsp;the bibliographic information that they produce. She&nbsp;will use the DH project survey data as the basis for a&nbsp;comparison with bibliographic ontologies (such as&nbsp;FRBRoo, BIBFRAME, Schema.org, and BIBO), and&nbsp;literature on challenges and best practices in&nbsp;bibliographic data modeling. Morgan will look for&nbsp;intersections, missed connections, and opportunities&nbsp;between digital humanities and cataloging work; and&nbsp;will consider how assumptions made in digital&nbsp;humanities elide the complexity and ongoing&nbsp;negotiations in the production of bibliographic data. In&nbsp;these projects, what drives the decisions to model (or&nbsp;not model) bibliographic data? How do the priorities&nbsp;of DH practitioners differ from those of library-based&nbsp;data creators? The increasing development of off-the-shelf tools, and the gradual growth of infrastructure&nbsp;for learning digital humanities skills and accessing&nbsp;data means that in many ways, it is possible for DHers,&nbsp;both new and experienced, to do more than before.&nbsp;However, increased access to materials and resources&nbsp;does not mean that the efforts of DH and library data&nbsp;communities will automatically complement each&nbsp;other. In FRBR, Before &amp; After, Karen Coyle observes&nbsp;that library personnel working with data &quot;have made&nbsp;little change in our approach to subject analysis in the&nbsp;last half-century, possibly because there isn't a clear&nbsp;direction for improving this aspect of our work.&quot; This&nbsp;paper will argue that similar ambiguities exist around&nbsp;the use of bibliographic data in DH projects, and that&nbsp;the apparent common ground of bibliographic data&nbsp;use is more complex than it appears.</span></p>
