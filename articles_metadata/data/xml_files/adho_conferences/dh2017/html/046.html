<p><span class="font4">It is no exaggeration to say that HBO's </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span><span class="font4"> is more than just a television series or a successful brand: it is a transmedia system in the sense&nbsp;first used by Marsha Kinder (1991) and popularized&nbsp;by Henry Jenkins (2006), in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “storyworld” of&nbsp;an original production. Now spanning six seasons and&nbsp;60 episodes, with an average global viewership (from&nbsp;its most recent season) of 25.1 million viewers per episode (Shepherd, 2016), it has spawned five video&nbsp;games, a graphic novel adaptation, several companion&nbsp;books, two rap albums, a 28-city orchestral tour, a&nbsp;wide variety of tabletop games, toys, merchandise and&nbsp;mobile apps, and countless podcasts, fanfics and other&nbsp;fan-based creations. Given the volume of content this&nbsp;represents, it is easy to forget that the television series&nbsp;itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom. As such, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span><span class="font4"> storyworld&nbsp;represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new, who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this sense, fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored. Transmedia systems, like that exemplified by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span><span class="font4">, are becoming increasingly prevalent (e.g., </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars, Harry Potter, The&nbsp;Walking Dead,</span><span class="font4"> the Marvel Cinematic Universe, etc);&nbsp;these systems demonstrate, in microcosm, the global&nbsp;challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society. The study&nbsp;of how people, as fans, access and manage information&nbsp;within a transmedia system provides valuable insight&nbsp;that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars&nbsp;of the media industry, but to the wider context of cultural studies, by offering findings on this new model of&nbsp;the fan as consumer and information-user. For us, as&nbsp;digital humanists, defining the “transmedia fan” is of&nbsp;particular relevance as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As a first step in defining the “transmedia fan”, the current project undertakes a comparative discourse&nbsp;analysis of online conversations of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">fans. One of the most dramatic plot developments in&nbsp;the source material (Martin, 2000) was adapted to the&nbsp;screen in the penultimate episode of the third season,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Rains of Castamere” (Benioff &amp; Weiss, 2013). Readers of the book series had long anticipated and&nbsp;dreaded the events of the “Red Wedding”, while fans of&nbsp;the show unfamiliar with Martin's narrative were</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the television series’ inception, writers at </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">The AV Club</span><span class="font4"> have written two critical reviews for each episode: one for viewers familiar with the books (i.e., “Experts”) and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books&nbsp;and averse to “spoilers” (i.e., “Newbies”). What results&nbsp;are two completely separate reviews of “The Rains of&nbsp;Castamere” which in turn document the fans’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment&nbsp;threads: one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode&nbsp;and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a pilot project, the current work takes the content of both comment threads—a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments—and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned&nbsp;with constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006).&nbsp;Through this analysis, a categorization of themes&nbsp;emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts&nbsp;and paratexts unique to each group of fans. These&nbsp;themes fall under two broad categories: sentimental&nbsp;negotiation (i.e., emotional responses) and tactical negotiation (i.e., cognitive, or reasoned responses). A&nbsp;comparison of categories and sub-categories between&nbsp;both groups provides preliminary findings to support&nbsp;an emergent model, or models, of the “transmedia&nbsp;fan”.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems, as exemplified by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span><span class="font4">, through the study of fans. The question posed by this research is, fundamentally, an&nbsp;examination of how the problem of “access” is framed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer. Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau's (1984) everyday life practice, in&nbsp;order to extend its application to the broader context&nbsp;of modern-day consumers. The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and&nbsp;quantitative research that will more clearly define the&nbsp;information behaviors of the transmedia fan. This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies, fan&nbsp;studies, information studies and digital humanities</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
