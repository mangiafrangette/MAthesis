<p><span class="font2">It can be challenging to be a solo digital humanist, given the range of skills required, deficits in training,&nbsp;and the need for software, hardware and technical&nbsp;support. As E.E. Snyder points out, researchers may be&nbsp;using digital methods but not consider themselves&nbsp;“digital humanists,” and thus exist outside of virtual&nbsp;networks like Twitter and conferences like Digital&nbsp;Humanities (2012). Even as colleges and universities&nbsp;recognize the potential of digital humanities, they&nbsp;often struggle to support and sustain DH projects.&nbsp;Digital humanities centers, like many cutting-edge,&nbsp;interdisciplinary academic programs and centers, are&nbsp;fragile, subject to changing priorities and budget cuts&nbsp;(Sample 2010). Moreover, DH centers may not&nbsp;necessarily be able to support the range of&nbsp;researchers’ interests and needs. In any case, many&nbsp;digital humanists work at institutions without a DH&nbsp;center, so they often lack institutional support and&nbsp;immediate colleagues whom they can learn from and&nbsp;with. Sample describes the common situation of the&nbsp;DH scholars who lack centers: “We’ll never be able to&nbsp;turn to colleagues who routinely navigate grant&nbsp;applications and budget deadlines... We’ll never have&nbsp;an institutional advocate on campus who can speak&nbsp;with a single voice to administrators, to students, to&nbsp;donors, to publishers, to communities about the value&nbsp;of the digital humanities” (Sample 2010). The isolation&nbsp;among many digital humanists also means that effort&nbsp;is duplicated, as, for example, faculty at multiple&nbsp;institutions are developing DH educational materials&nbsp;similar to those being created elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Networks provide a potential solution to isolation by linking people with shared research interests and&nbsp;enabling them to exchange ideas and expertise. Nancy&nbsp;Maron suggests that a campus-based network model--whether with equal partners or “a strong central hub,&nbsp;like a library or a DH center, with many spokes” -- may&nbsp;be a preferred organizational model for DH, as it can&nbsp;balance experimentation and sustainability and&nbsp;combine units’ strengths (Maron 2015). Beyond the&nbsp;campus, as Sample argues, researchers can build their&nbsp;own communities that transcend institutions and are&nbsp;more agile and resilient than formal organizations:&nbsp;“Stop forming committees and begin creating&nbsp;coalitions. Seek affinities over affiliations, networks&nbsp;over institutes” (2010). Networks can cultivate&nbsp;collective expertise and facilitate acting on common&nbsp;interests without getting caught up in bureaucracy or&nbsp;being limited by long-term obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indeed, digital humanists are participating in a range of networks, from global to regional to&nbsp;university-based. Many digital humanists are&nbsp;connected around the world through Twitter’s virtual&nbsp;network. At the country or regional level,&nbsp;organizations such as </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Red de Humanidades Digitales&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(RedHD), NYCDH, and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Texas Digital Humanities&nbsp;Consortium</span><span class="font2"> (authors Spiro and Taylor are part of the&nbsp;steering committee of the TDHC) provide online&nbsp;platforms for researchers to discover each other and&nbsp;share information, as well as organize training and&nbsp;events. Within universities or university systems,&nbsp;digital humanities networks such as the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Oxford DH&nbsp;Network</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">University of Wisconsin-Madison's&nbsp;Digital Humanities Research Network</span><span class="font2"> coordinate&nbsp;events and build community among local digital&nbsp;humanists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As powerful as these networks are, most do not provide funding for collaboration across institutions&nbsp;on research projects, nor do they organize common&nbsp;work on curriculum. Enter </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Resilient Networks to&nbsp;Support Inclusive Digital Humanities</span><span class="font2">, a collaboration&nbsp;among George Washington University (GW), Rice&nbsp;University, Davidson College, and Prairie View A&amp;M&nbsp;University funded by the Andrew W. Mellon&nbsp;Foundation in the spring of 2016. This network aims&nbsp;to advance digital scholarship by sponsoring&nbsp;collaborative projects among faculty, librarians and&nbsp;students and by developing openly available&nbsp;educational modules that can be used to form a DH&nbsp;curriculum. It brings together private research&nbsp;universities in Washington DC (GW) and Texas (Rice),&nbsp;a public historically black university in Texas (Prairie&nbsp;View A&amp;M), and a private liberal arts college in North&nbsp;Carolina (Davidson College). The co PIs are a member&nbsp;of the library staff and a faculty member from each&nbsp;institution who, together with the project director,&nbsp;oversee the program through bi-weekly online&nbsp;meetings and occasional face-to-face meetings. An&nbsp;Advisory Committee provides strategic guidance for&nbsp;the project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Between the spring of 2016 and the spring of 2018, Resilient Networks will create:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">A set of openly licensed, adaptable&nbsp;educational modules on digital humanities&nbsp;that can be used in different contexts, such as&nbsp;workshops and semester-long courses.&nbsp;Planned modules include introduction to&nbsp;digital humanities, data in the humanities,&nbsp;the ethos of digital humanities, and framing&nbsp;projects for the public, as well as electives on&nbsp;topics such as text mining and database&nbsp;design and development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Cross-institutional projects in which a&nbsp;faculty member, librarian and students&nbsp;collaborate on digital humanities research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To facilitate the cross-institutional projects, Resilient Networks is awarding faculty&nbsp;$5000 jump start packages as seed funding;&nbsp;one is being granted at each institution&nbsp;during year 1, and three during year 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">A group of librarians, faculty, and students&nbsp;knowledgeable about digital humanities&nbsp;methods and collaborative approaches. In&nbsp;August 2016, a small group of faculty and&nbsp;librarians gathered at GW for a training&nbsp;workshop on DH project development and&nbsp;humanities approaches to data facilitated by&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Trevor Munoz</span><span class="font2">. In addition, the Network&nbsp;sponsored a THATCamp at the Digital&nbsp;Frontiers conference hosted at Rice in&nbsp;September 2016 and a THATCamp at George&nbsp;Washington University in March 2017. The&nbsp;network will further support training by&nbsp;organizing THATCamps and providing&nbsp;funding for members to attend intensive DH&nbsp;workshops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Intra- and inter-institutional relationships&nbsp;that will facilitate ongoing DH&nbsp;collaborations. Many networks depend on&nbsp;strong personal relationships. Through&nbsp;collaborative work on research, curriculum&nbsp;and training, the Resilient Networks will&nbsp;develop such relationships, laying the&nbsp;foundation for ongoing collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are challenges in establishing the Network that are to be expected with a cross-institutional&nbsp;collaboration, including setting common goals,&nbsp;maintaining strong communication, negotiating&nbsp;different academic calendars and bureaucratic&nbsp;systems, and accomplishing tasks in the face of&nbsp;competing responsibilities. In addition, the sheer&nbsp;diversity of digital humanities methods makes it&nbsp;difficult to build a coherent community. On the upside,&nbsp;however, by working within the existing institutional&nbsp;structures at each university rather than creating a&nbsp;separate organizational unit, the work will more likely&nbsp;be sustainable in the long term and better serve the&nbsp;needs of the researchers at each institution. As Snyder&nbsp;cautions, “Decentralised networks that lack both&nbsp;institutional support and dedicated time spent in&nbsp;creating resources will face serious barriers; if there is&nbsp;no position that has explicit responsibility for&nbsp;developing the network, the network may fall by the&nbsp;wayside in the pressure of more urgent&nbsp;responsibilities” (2012). To mitigate this risk, Resilient&nbsp;Networks hired a Digital Humanities Project Director&nbsp;to organize program activities and manage day-to-day&nbsp;operations. Establishing inter-institutional and crossinstitutional ties will leverage already-established&nbsp;organizational structures rather than creating new&nbsp;ones. We expect the network to scale to include more&nbsp;institutions, which will expand available expertise. We&nbsp;will be conducting assessments to evaluate the various&nbsp;aspects of the resilient network model to determine its&nbsp;effectiveness in meeting our overall objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this short paper, we will discuss the network model for digital humanities research and education,&nbsp;results from the first year of “Resilient Networks,” and&nbsp;future plans.</span></p>
