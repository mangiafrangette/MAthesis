<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Research Center as Distant Publisher: Developing&nbsp;Non-Consumptive&nbsp;Compliant Open Data&nbsp;Worksets to Support New&nbsp;Modes of Inquiry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Robert H. McDonald</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><a href="mailto:rhmcdona@indiana.edu">rhmcdona@indiana.edu</a></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indiana University, United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the original Google Books Settlement Agreement in 2008 (Courant 2009), funds were to be set aside to&nbsp;create a research center that would enable researchers worldwide to accomplish data-mining and analysis&nbsp;on texts in the public domain and under copyright in a&nbsp;manner that was secure and compliant with appropriate U.S. copyright law. This did not happen, because&nbsp;the court rejected the agreement in 2011. Despite this,&nbsp;in 2011, the HTDL announced that Indiana University&nbsp;Bloomington and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign would run the HTRC under a cooperative&nbsp;funding agreement with the HathiTrust Board of Governors and the University of Michigan. Since 2014,&nbsp;HTRC has made available as an active production service tools to analyze a set of out-of-copyright content&nbsp;equaling around 4.4 million volumes. In 2016, the&nbsp;HTRC plans to enable analysis of the entirety of the 15&nbsp;million-volume corpus currently held by the HTDL, the&nbsp;largest digital academic library in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HTRC and Non-Consumptive Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The HTRC has developed a process to define and work within the concept of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">non-consumptive</span><span class="font3"> computational access to support the fair-use of the HTDL&nbsp;corpus as defined within the Google Books Settlement&nbsp;Agreement that was a part of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authors Guild et al. v.&nbsp;Google Inc</span><span class="font3"> case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Currently the HTRC defines the process for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">non-consumptive</span><span class="font3"> use of the HTDL corpus as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Research in which computational analysis is performed on one or more books, but not research in which a researcher reads or displays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Operationally, from the perspective of the HTRC research cyberinfrastructure, the HTRC defines </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">non-consumptive</span><span class="font3"> research as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That which requires that no action or set of actions on the part of users, either acting alone or in cooperation with other users over the duration of one or multiple sessions can result in sufficient information gathered from a collection of&nbsp;copyrighted works to reassemble pages from&nbsp;the collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This concept has been further refined in the course of the development of the HTRC Data Capsule (Zeng et&nbsp;al. 2014) for secure data analysis and the development</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of the HTRC Workset Ontology (Jett et al. 2016) and has been codified in the recently released HathiTrust&nbsp;Research Center Non-Consumptive Use Research Policy (HTRC, 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HTRC as Publisher</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the course of work with scholars using the HTRC tools and services to create derivative non-consumptive data sets, the Center has often taken on a set&nbsp;of the roles traditionally played by publishers. These&nbsp;data sets are reviewed by members of the HTRC staff&nbsp;for compliance with non-consumptive use standards&nbsp;prior to release to the authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As part of this work, the HTRC has offered as a service the capability to publish these non-consumptive, compliant data sets using a DOI scheme (Downie;&nbsp;2015). This service enables the creation of new derivatives (Downie; 2015) of published non-consumptive&nbsp;compliant data sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A second benefit of opening access to these data sets is the ability to replicate current experiments that&nbsp;have been developed using the HTDL corpus and the&nbsp;HTRC tool set. From this standpoint the HTRC functions as a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distant publisher</span><span class="font3"> of non-consumptive compliant data sets in support of new models of research&nbsp;inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Distant Publishing as Concept</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to defining the concept of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distant publishing</span><span class="font3">, it is first instructive to understand </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distant reading&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">within the context of digital humanities. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Distant reading</span><span class="font3"> was first codified in 2000 by noted humanist and&nbsp;scholar Franco Moretti:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Distant reading: where distance . . . is a condition of knowledge: it allows you to focus on</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">units that are much smaller or much larger than</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the text: devices, themes, tropes - or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and the&nbsp;very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is&nbsp;one of those cases when one can justifiably say,&nbsp;less is more. (Moretti 2000)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moretti later expanded the concept in his 2013 monograph of the same name (Moretti 2013). Much like Moretti's definition that focuses on enabling a broader&nbsp;view of the text, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distant publisher</span><span class="font3"> enables a&nbsp;broader view of data sets through bringing to bear the&nbsp;current corpus of computational tools for large-scale&nbsp;textual data mining and analysis. HTRC as a distant&nbsp;publisher is removed by at least one degree from the&nbsp;creator, and remains distinct from any standardized&nbsp;concept of publisher. Yet, data sets are published under the rubric of the HTRC, and these publications are&nbsp;freed from the constraints of copyright in this context&nbsp;due to their non-consumptive nature. Thus we define&nbsp;distant publishing as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publication of a non-consumptive data set outside of any standardized publishing construct, removed by&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font3"> degree from the original creator, openly available to&nbsp;the community of scholars for replication and available for re-use in support of the advancement of&nbsp;knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This definition is one that the HTRC aims to further refine in the coming years. We welcome broader&nbsp;thoughts on this concept from those working to preserve open research data and the software that makes&nbsp;that data accessible for use in scientific experimental&nbsp;replication and re-use for the long-term benefit of the&nbsp;scholarly community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Distant Publishing Use Cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Currently the HTRC is developing models that support our current definition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distant publishing.</span><span class="font3"> These models are illustrated in several use cases, outlined&nbsp;below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Extracted Features Worksets </span><span class="font3">- HTRC expects this concept to be further refined as we move toward the second round of HTRC Advanced Collaborative Support grants which&nbsp;will be funded in summer 2016. Our most&nbsp;progressive case for distant publishing at&nbsp;this point is leveraged through the publication and release of our main extracted features workset. The current workset is a prototype based on the 4.8 million volume public domain collection from the HTDL.&nbsp;Through 2016-17 this workset will be redefined to include more of the HTDL collection.&nbsp;From this initial workset publication we&nbsp;have seen further refinements of the&nbsp;workset by scholars such as Ted Underwood&nbsp;(Underwood et al. 2013), Colin Allen (Murdock, Zeng, and Allen 2016), and Matthew&nbsp;Wilkens (Wilkens 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HT+Bookworm </span><span class="font3">- The HathiTrust+Book-worm (HT+BW) project (2016) presents textual content through interactive visualization. Whereas HT+BW has previously been&nbsp;used in standalone contexts with pre-determined metadata, currently HT+BW is enabling scholars to analyze custom personal&nbsp;collections from within the larger corpus and&nbsp;the use of HT+BW as a supplement to other&nbsp;uses of the HTRC. This concept could eventually become a new possibility for derived&nbsp;workset publication in its own right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HTRC Workset Ontology </span><span class="font3">- Currently in development, the HTRC Workset Ontology is&nbsp;part of a collections data model by the&nbsp;Workset Creation for Scholarly Analysis project (HTRC 2016), an HTRC research initiative funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The resulting HTRC Workset data&nbsp;model is designed to aid humanities scholars&nbsp;by helping them to describe selected portions of the HTDL corpus that serve as the&nbsp;objects of their research. The resulting&nbsp;worksets are persistent, citable, and can be&nbsp;assessed by other scholars for reuse in additional research processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today's digital scholars are embracing new opportunities to explore their disciplines through the type of enhanced computational analysis that the HTRC provides. As the Center works to define emerging possibilities within the context of non-consumptive research, distant publishing will enable us to engage&nbsp;with the community of open data and open software&nbsp;publishers to ensure that our collections are accessible, open and available for the next generation of distant readers and their plans for new forms of scholarship.</span></p>
