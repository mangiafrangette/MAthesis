<p><span class="font1">The digital humanities offers the promise and potential for global, multilingual, and multicultural&nbsp;collaborations as enabled by digital technologies that&nbsp;deliver public-facing scholarship that enriches and&nbsp;expands research communities. Realizing that&nbsp;potential requires approaches that embrace&nbsp;complexity, spanning the technological, social,&nbsp;procedural, and community concerns. In 2016-2017,&nbsp;the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) is&nbsp;undertaking a research project to study and advance&nbsp;support for the Digital Humanities specifically with&nbsp;Caribbean Studies, focusing on leveraging&nbsp;technologies to support public-facing scholarship,&nbsp;open access to research and results, enabling digital&nbsp;humanities research publications with technologies&nbsp;that meet access needs, and collaboration among&nbsp;scholars and communities. This presentation provides&nbsp;background on dLOC as a digital library, dLOC’s&nbsp;evolution into a community connecting place and&nbsp;platform for digital humanities and Caribbean Studies,&nbsp;and the opportunities and needs for the digital&nbsp;humanities for enlarging scholarly and worldwide&nbsp;community access to Caribbean Studies.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">About dLOC</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">The Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) is a unique, open access, collaborative, international,&nbsp;multi-lingual digital library for resources from and&nbsp;about the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean, providing&nbsp;access and ensuring preservation for Caribbean&nbsp;materials (digitized and born-digital) and publicfacing scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dLOC focuses on how a community of practice can best create a digital library in terms of contents,&nbsp;functionality, and robust governance for inclusivity&nbsp;and diversity. In dLOC’s governance and operational&nbsp;model, partner institutions agree to shared goals and&nbsp;processes following a governance structure for:&nbsp;inclusive and distributed collection development&nbsp;where partners select materials, permissions-based&nbsp;infrastructure (partners retain all rights to materials),&nbsp;functional hubs, decentralized/local digitalization and&nbsp;digital curation, collaborative activities to develop the&nbsp;community of practice and increase capacity through&nbsp;collaboration. For all of this work—spanning tools for&nbsp;digitalization, online digital library functionality for&nbsp;patrons and users, tools for advanced querying and&nbsp;mining, and tools for automating reporting and user&nbsp;management which are necessary for operations at&nbsp;scale and reports to different governmental and&nbsp;academic entities—dLOC’s technologies have been&nbsp;defined by and created in collaboration with partner&nbsp;institutions and scholars. Thus, over the past 12 years,&nbsp;dLOC has developed through collaboration into as a&nbsp;socio-technical (people, policies, communities,&nbsp;technologies) platform supporting collaboration&nbsp;among partner institutions, developing and enhancing&nbsp;communities of practice, and building intellectual&nbsp;infrastructure.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">dLOC, Caribbean Studies, and Digital Humanities</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">dLOC originally focused on building content, and has grown into one of the largest open access&nbsp;collections of Caribbean materials with over 2.5&nbsp;million pages of content, over 40 partner institutions&nbsp;(universities, colleges, libraries, archives, museums,&nbsp;government agencies, NGOs, publishers, and scholarly&nbsp;societies, as well as many contributing scholars and&nbsp;private collectors), and over 3 million views each&nbsp;month. With this growth, the dLOC Executive&nbsp;Committee, Scholarly Advisory Board, and full&nbsp;community recognized the need to emphasize new&nbsp;stages of development, specifically focused on further&nbsp;engaging scholars in digital humanities practices that&nbsp;build upon dLOC’s commitment to access,&nbsp;preservation, the production of public-facing&nbsp;scholarship, and engaging across institutions and&nbsp;communities to further the community of practice as a&nbsp;constellation of communities of practice where all&nbsp;involved are leveraging the affordances of technology&nbsp;to further public humanities and interdisciplinary&nbsp;aspects of modern scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 2016, the dLOC Executive Committee charged the dLOC Digital Scholarship Director with&nbsp;undertaking research into next steps for dLOC’s sociotechnical development (people, policies, technologies,&nbsp;communities) in relation to new opportunities with&nbsp;the digital humanities. dLOC currently supports the&nbsp;digital humanities in many forms, including curated&nbsp;materials and collections, digital humanities exhibits,&nbsp;pedagogical resources, teaching guides, and&nbsp;supporting faculty in developing online research and&nbsp;teaching materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dLOC’s work in the digital humanities grapples directly with questions of access in the digital age. For&nbsp;example, one of dLOC’s digital humanities projects is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haiti: An Island Luminous. Haiti: An Island Luminous&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">began when then-PhD student Adam Silvia recognized&nbsp;the importance of materials about and from Haiti in&nbsp;dLOC, both for the significance of each item and for the&nbsp;sheer scale of materials available. Many of the&nbsp;materials in dLOC were not known to exist in the&nbsp;world, before being located by partner institutions and&nbsp;then digitized. Once the materials became available,&nbsp;the necessary scholarly and information ecosystems to&nbsp;link and cite the items was not in place. Indeed,&nbsp;scholars would be unlikely to search for items that&nbsp;were believed to have been lost to history. To create the&nbsp;necessary community connections, Silvia contacted&nbsp;members of the dLOC team and began collaborating to&nbsp;develop what was planned as an online exhibit to&nbsp;showcase materials. As the project began, the scope&nbsp;continued to grow. In its final release, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haiti: An Island&nbsp;Luminous</span><span class="font1"> is a curated edited online collection with&nbsp;contributions from over 100 of the top Haitian Studies&nbsp;scholars. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haiti: An Island Luminous</span><span class="font1"> is in English,&nbsp;French, and Kreyol, and has been taught in schools in&nbsp;Florida and Haiti. Developed first online, the site is&nbsp;being developed for offline use on standalone&nbsp;kiosk/tablet installations, to meet access needs&nbsp;despite limited connectivity. Discussions are&nbsp;underway on the possibility of a print version to meet&nbsp;needs for limited online and electrical access, with the&nbsp;print version to include all pages from the curated&nbsp;edited collection online, samples of items, and with an&nbsp;accompanying USB drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another example of dLOC’s digital humanities work is the course “Panama Silver, Asian Gold: Migration,&nbsp;Money, and the Making of the Modern Caribbean.” The&nbsp;course focused on the lesser studied Asian and Indian&nbsp;indenture in the Caribbean and was a Distributed&nbsp;Online Collaborative Course (DOCC), taught in&nbsp;multiple semesters and multiple iterations, most&nbsp;recently with the teaching team comprised of faculty,&nbsp;librarians, and archivists at the University of the West&nbsp;Indies, Cave Hill Barbados, University of Miami,&nbsp;University of Florida, and Amherst College. This&nbsp;collaboratively developed and taught course engaged&nbsp;the teaching team and students across all of the&nbsp;campuses in the use of materials in dLOC, other digital&nbsp;resources, and not-yet-digital resources held at each of&nbsp;the institutions to create new works of digital&nbsp;scholarship with students from different campuses&nbsp;working collaboratively. The course is underway for&nbsp;revision to focus on migration and mobility, to further&nbsp;expand the potential collaborators and fields engaged&nbsp;in this interdisciplinary collaborative course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Both the DOCC series and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haiti: An Island Luminous </span><span class="font1">present real examples of imagined possibilities for&nbsp;expanding Caribbean Studies in the digital age for&nbsp;creating public-facing scholarship, enhancing access to&nbsp;scholarly works, opportunities from the digital&nbsp;humanities in pedagogy and academic curricula, and&nbsp;the potentials for access as enabled by collaboration&nbsp;among scholars and communities.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Expanding Access through dLOC for Caribbean Studies and Digital Humanities</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Caribbean Studies is an interdisciplinary field with broad connections across languages and cultures.&nbsp;dLOC takes its definition of the Caribbean from the&nbsp;Association of Caribbean University, Research, and&nbsp;Institutional Libraries, which defines the Caribbean as&nbsp;“the area of the Caribbean archipelago, the mainland&nbsp;countries including the Guianas, and the states of the&nbsp;United States which border on the Caribbean Sea or&nbsp;Gulf of Mexico.” Even this is immediately expanded&nbsp;with diasporic connections. dLOC’s success as a digital&nbsp;library is made possible by the recognition that the&nbsp;Caribbean exceeds the boundaries for any specific&nbsp;geographic area, language, or field of study, and by the&nbsp;generous framing for Caribbean Studies with the&nbsp;respect and support for interdisciplinary and&nbsp;diasporic connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dLOC was founded to meet the needs for preservation and access as a first step in supporting&nbsp;expanding the field of Caribbean Studies. As both the&nbsp;series of DOCCs and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haiti: An Island Luminous&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">demonstrate, simply creating online access to&nbsp;materials is only part of the equation. As Adam J. Banks&nbsp;explains in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Race, Rhetoric, and Technology: Searching&nbsp;for Higher Ground,</span><span class="font1"> access includes material access,&nbsp;which is met with materials being online, at least for&nbsp;those with online access and the functional access to&nbsp;be able to find and use materials. The digital&nbsp;humanities offers ways of conceiving and creating the&nbsp;means for experiential access, where materials are&nbsp;relevant for people’s lives, and transformative access,&nbsp;where there is “a genuine inclusion in technologies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and the networks of power that help determine what they become, but never merely for the sake of&nbsp;inclusion” (45).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This presentation will review methodologies and results from the 2016-2017 research on the digital&nbsp;humanities and Caribbean Studies. The research&nbsp;includes site visits to the US Virgin Islands, Jamaica,&nbsp;Barbados, Curasao, Trinidad, and Leiden (for the&nbsp;Dutch Caribbean Archives) to discuss current&nbsp;activities, projects, terminology, and framing to enable&nbsp;connections across communities. The site visits&nbsp;include engagement with scholars from multiple&nbsp;fields, museum professionals, librarians, archivists,&nbsp;governmental representatives, educators, and others.&nbsp;All materials from the research visits are shared with&nbsp;communities engaged and connected with Caribbean&nbsp;Studies through conferences and various means. This&nbsp;grounded approach allows for identification,&nbsp;recognition, and connection of digital humanities work&nbsp;being done, even when not previously labeled as such.&nbsp;The presentation will include findings on how dLOC is&nbsp;enabling responses and activities to meet the needs for&nbsp;material through transformational access through&nbsp;technologies, procedures, communities, and&nbsp;technologies.</span></p>
