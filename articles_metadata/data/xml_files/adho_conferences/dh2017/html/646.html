<p><span class="font1">Scholars conducting historical research are provided with a growing range of digital humanities tools, supporting different phases of the research process:&nbsp;there is software for extracting text from documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(such as pdftotex, available on many Linux distributions or as part of Poppler), run OCR processes on images (for example </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tesseract</span><span class="font1">), tools for the creation, analysis, and visualization of datasets (for instance&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Nodegoat</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Palladio</span><span class="font1">, or </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Visualeyes</span><span class="font1">), or software to&nbsp;work with annotations (for example </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Annotation Studio</span><span class="font1">) or networks (such as </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Gephi</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Cytoscape</span><span class="font1">). Programming libraries are being developed to serve the&nbsp;needs of humanity scholars, like </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Spacy</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tethne</span><span class="font1">.&nbsp;There are several repositories (such as </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">HathiTrust</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Europeana</span><span class="font1">) that provide access to sources and can&nbsp;easily be integrated into other services through APIs.&nbsp;Many tools, however, work well as self-contained units&nbsp;that scholars can use as singular parts of their research&nbsp;process, but cannot easily be combined into an integrated workflow by the researcher. Existing and new&nbsp;tools are developed using different languages and programming frameworks depending on requirements,&nbsp;skillset, and preference of the original developer, making reuse and integration harder for the developer&nbsp;seeking to combine several tools. Moreover, since&nbsp;most tools are developed independently of each other,&nbsp;many efforts are repeated by reimplementing functionality that is already provided by a different piece&nbsp;of software.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this workshop, we would like to gather developers and programming-literate scholars to share their tool-building experiences and to present our first&nbsp;practical steps to create a system integrating multiple&nbsp;tools to work with historical documents from scan to&nbsp;analysis. The workshop is intended as a starting point&nbsp;for future exchange and cooperation for digital humanities developers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the summer of 2016, the Digital Innovation Group at Arizona State University (ASU) and the Max&nbsp;Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG)&nbsp;started to combine their efforts in developing software&nbsp;for the history of science. One outcome of this collaboration is a research system that allows users to manage their documents, automatically runs OCR on uploaded files, provides an image viewer for uploaded&nbsp;and extracted images, and integrates document management with a multi-user Jupyter notebook server for&nbsp;writing analysis and visualization scripts. Rather than&nbsp;one big system, however, the research system is comprised of several integrated services developed independently of each other using different programming&nbsp;languages and frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the Digital Humanities Conference 2017, we propose a full-day workshop with the goal to connect&nbsp;different tools and services to build a tool infrastructure for historical research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first half of the workshop will give tool developers a chance to present their software. Every presenter will be allowed 10 minutes for their presentation and 5 minutes for questions. ASU and MPIWG will present the different components of the developed research system. Specifically, we will present the following projects:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Collaborative Jupyter Notebooks: </span><span class="font1">a Ju-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">pyter Notebook server that allows sharing and publishing of notebooks based on Next-cloud and Dataverse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">DocuManager: </span><span class="font1">an environment for annotating, correcting and searching digital documents, in particular for OCR text in ALTOXML and HOCR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Giles Ecosystem</span><span class="font1">: an Apache Kafka-based&nbsp;service to extract images and texts from documents and run OCR procedures on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Digilib</span><span class="font3">: </span><span class="font1">a Java-based IIIF-compliant image&nbsp;server and viewer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second half will be dedicated to discussing how different tools can be connected and integrated, and&nbsp;how we can build a community around those tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We envision the results of this workshop to be a concrete roadmap of how different tools will be integrated. We will define interfaces and API requirements, and if possible start development work during&nbsp;the workshop. Second, we will develop an organizational strategy for cooperation and collaboration&nbsp;among different projects. To aid organization, we will&nbsp;provide a Jira and Confluence project that participants&nbsp;can use during and after the workshop to organize collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We plan on organizing a follow-up meeting at the end of 2017 at Arizona State University to review progress since the initial workshop and plan next steps. If&nbsp;the collaboration is successful, we hope to establish&nbsp;regular meetings and expand the group to connect&nbsp;more tools and services.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Participants/Call</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">We will send out a call for participation in form of a short tool presentation for the first part of the workshop. We will ask presenters to focus on the technical&nbsp;perspective of their tool answering the following key&nbsp;questions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• </span><span class="font1">What is the general workflow of the tool?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• </span><span class="font1">What is the core functionality of the tool?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• </span><span class="font1">What input and output formats does the tool accept? Or what interfaces does it expose?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• </span><span class="font1">What license model was chosen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• </span><span class="font1">What features are still missing and what are the next development goals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• </span><span class="font1">How is maintenance and development of the tool organized?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The deadline for the call is July 1st, 2017. We plan to accept 5-10 submission for our call, based on the&nbsp;usefulness of the tool and the potential for integration&nbsp;with other tools, which would all fit the first half of the&nbsp;workshop.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Audience</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The target audience for this workshop are developers, historians with programming background, scholars with a technical background, and generally people involved in the development of tools to support historical research.</span></p>
