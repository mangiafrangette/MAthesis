<p><span class="font1">This poster will describe recent work on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence,</span><span class="font1"> a digital project that makes visible decades of&nbsp;state-sanctioned acts of violence in the United States&nbsp;during the first decades of the twentieth century. From&nbsp;1900 through 1930, vigilantes and Texas Rangers&nbsp;killed hundreds of ethnic and national Mexicans along&nbsp;the Mexico/Texas border. &quot;A man's life just wasn't&nbsp;worth much at all,&quot; recalled eyewitness Roland A.&nbsp;Warnock, &quot;There were so many innocent people killed&nbsp;in that mess that it just made you sick to your heart to&nbsp;see it happening.&quot; This period of conflict is one of the&nbsp;largest episodes of civil unrest in American history&nbsp;and still impacts the struggle for justice and civil rights&nbsp;that continues today in Texas and in America at-large.&nbsp;However, this history is widely unknown. Like </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Visualizing Emancipation</span><span class="font1"> (University of Richmond), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digital&nbsp;Harlem</span><span class="font1"> (University of Sydney), and other projects that&nbsp;remind us of the hyperlocal stories and histories of&nbsp;particular geographic regions, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence</span><span class="font1"> aims&nbsp;to recover and make accessible lives, events, and acts&nbsp;of oppression that continue to impact later generations in various ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence</span><span class="font1"> is part of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Refusing to Forget</span><span class="font1">, a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">public humanities initiative involving collaborators from Brown University, Loyola, Texas A&amp;M, the University of Texas, and South Texas College (among others) that is working to raise awareness about this history of racial violence and its legacies. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence</span><span class="font1"> is complemented and informed by additional endeavors by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Refusing to Forget</span><span class="font1"> team: academic articles and books, applications for Texas historical markers acknowledging this history, collaborations with&nbsp;Texas public school educators to develop curriculum,&nbsp;and exhibitions of material with the Bullock Texas&nbsp;State History Museum. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence</span><span class="font1">, we envision a project that functions as a database of primary&nbsp;and secondary sources for researchers studying this&nbsp;history, a curated and dynamic resource for classroom&nbsp;use, a memorial space that honors and remembers the&nbsp;victims of these acts of violence, and a corrective to&nbsp;historical narratives and commemorations that erase&nbsp;or mute these moments in the history of Texas, Mexico,&nbsp;and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This poster will document recent and ongoing work at Brown University on the completion of the&nbsp;first public-facing iteration of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence</span><span class="font1"> (currently scheduled to launch in the fall of 2017). It will</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">provide an overview of the creation of a database of material derived from primary and secondary texts,&nbsp;narrate the iterative processes of mapping and annotating data about state-sanctioned violence, and consider the ways in which the design of the project is informed by its stakeholders and its range of imagined&nbsp;audiences (educators, academics, activists, students,&nbsp;among others). The poster will highlight the significant roles undergraduate collaborators (from a range&nbsp;of academic disciplines including Computer Science&nbsp;and Ethnic Studies) have played in the project at various stages: as researchers, programmers, designers,&nbsp;developers, and curators. We will also document the&nbsp;project's timeline, workflow, and challenges. What are&nbsp;the challenges inherent in creating a digital space that&nbsp;is both an act of commemoration and a source of research (challenges faced by projects with similar inclinations like </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Marathon: The Boston Bombing Digital&nbsp;Archive</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The 9/11 Digital Archive</span><span class="font1">, among others)?&nbsp;In what ways can database creation and digital curation productively remediate and recontextualize controversial historical events for public audiences? How&nbsp;do we navigate desires to tell hyper-specific, localized&nbsp;stories about individual victims of violence with inclinations to inventory and resituate these events within&nbsp;larger narratives about race, gender, and nationalism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A working demo of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mapping Violence</span><span class="font1"> will accompany the poster, provided there is room and available resources to do so.</span></p>
