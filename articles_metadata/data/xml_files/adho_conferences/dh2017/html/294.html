<p><span class="font1">This talk will report on the formation of an online open source register for early modern English&nbsp;sermons, a collaborative effort that includes scholars&nbsp;and technical experts from North America, the United&nbsp;Kingdom, and Japan. The need for a digital register of&nbsp;early modern sermons is abundantly clear to scholars&nbsp;who specialize in the history of the church and&nbsp;religious practice. Sermons were, for better or worse,&nbsp;central to efforts to broadcast and enforce disquieting&nbsp;religious reforms and to address the unsettling&nbsp;controversies in religious practice during the early&nbsp;modern period. It should be stressed, also, that a well-constructed and user-friendly platform of this nature&nbsp;would reach the many among the general public who&nbsp;are interested in the history of religion in general and&nbsp;in Christian church history in particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term register is used here to denote a comprehensive and searchable list of English sermons,&nbsp;sermon events, and related sermon information from&nbsp;a variety of contemporaneous records and sources&nbsp;during the period 1500 to 1700, including sermons delivered to English audiences in Latin will also be catalogued. This project will not attempt to digitalize full&nbsp;texts of print or manuscript sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Extant sermons were often printed long after they were delivered and many remain separately&nbsp;catalogued in manuscript. Non-extant sermons are&nbsp;known about from disparate sources: chronicles,&nbsp;diaries, private correspondence, and records of church&nbsp;and state. This lack of cohesion creates something of a&nbsp;vacuum amidst a plethora of sources that make&nbsp;reference to preaching in general and also to&nbsp;individual sermons. The goal of this project, therefore,&nbsp;is to bring to a list of sermons the cataloguing and&nbsp;search functionality (on a much smaller scale) that the&nbsp;British Library Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) online&nbsp;currently affords printed works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There have been efforts recently to explore and document sermons during this period in digital&nbsp;formats but with differing objectives. These efforts include digital platforms in early development such as the&nbsp;announcement to ‘Gateway to Early Modern Manuscript&nbsp;Sermons’ (</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">GEMMS</span><span class="font1">), as well as digital projects such as The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St Paul's Cathedral Project</span><span class="font1"> (formerly the </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtual Paul's&nbsp;Cross Project</span><span class="font1">) and John Foxe’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">The Acts and Monuments&nbsp;Online</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font1"> Standard resources for this project are, of course,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ESTC Online, EEBO-TCP,</span><span class="font1"> and for later reprints of early&nbsp;modern sermons Internet Archive has become increasingly useful. A host of fine scholars have been drawn to&nbsp;the study of early modern sermons, but this field has&nbsp;lacked an annotated and comprehensive register of&nbsp;sermons and sermon events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The developers of this project will use a TEI-compliant XML structure. Much of the platform can be encoded with standardized markups for such&nbsp;elements as date, speaker, and location. However, this&nbsp;project is faced with the task of identifying and&nbsp;defining elements for a register in a space between&nbsp;digital bibliography and online textual archives or&nbsp;corpora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Metadata will have to be extended to include an abundant number of tags for such areas as theological&nbsp;debate (e.g. purgatory, Eucharist) and church practice&nbsp;(e.g. baptism, burial). An exhaustive list of metaconcepts peculiar to the religious attitudes and&nbsp;movements of the period will have to be constructed.&nbsp;Among the many examples, such meta-tags as “antitheatre,” “Anabaptist,” and “recantation,” will have to&nbsp;be identified, agreed upon, and listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In sum, the greatest challenge for this project is in developing a comprehensive taxonomy for its&nbsp;metadata. In the view of the project team, the best way&nbsp;to approach this challenge is to start small and to learn&nbsp;by doing. Phase 1 of this project, therefore, is to&nbsp;digitalize and annotate Millar Maclure’s register of the&nbsp;sermons of Paul’s Cross along with the supplement to&nbsp;this edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Paul’s Cross, the outdoor preaching pulpit located on the northeast side of the St Paul’s precinct in early&nbsp;modern London, will be treated as ground zero for the&nbsp;cataloguing of early modern sermons. Located in the&nbsp;commercial and cultural center of London, Paul’s&nbsp;Cross was the most influential public site for preaching&nbsp;to large, non-elite audiences in England during&nbsp;tumultuous periods of religious reform. This one&nbsp;locale had an immeasurable impact on Christian&nbsp;practice and public opinion from the Henrican period&nbsp;until the years leading up to the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the project expands toward its goal of being a comprehensive annotated register for all early</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">modern sermons, the TEI XML encoding and extensions will allow scaling to a much larger&nbsp;platform. During Phase 1 the metadata arrangement&nbsp;for developers will be clarified. Should problems or&nbsp;omissions arise, which they invariably do, the fix can&nbsp;be made before the project expands. Finally, given that&nbsp;TEI has become the standard for what will become a&nbsp;partner project, this encoding will be highly adaptable&nbsp;should it eventually be contributed to a digital archive&nbsp;repository or OAIS.</span></p>
