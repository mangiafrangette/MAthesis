<p><span class="font3">In 1624, Henry Wotton highlighted the importance of “the Properties of a well-chosen Prospect”, a&nbsp;concept of viewing landscapes, which Wotton dubbed&nbsp;“the Royaltie of Sight” (Wotton, 1624, p.14).&nbsp;Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English designed&nbsp;landscapes were artificially organised to optimise the&nbsp;‘prospect’ whilst reflecting the landowners’ individual&nbsp;perspectives. However, little analysis has been&nbsp;attempted into determining the extent and&nbsp;characteristics of ‘prospect’ and ‘perspective’ at&nbsp;specific sites. The destruction and modernisation of&nbsp;estate landscapes has hindered their analysis and&nbsp;reshaped perceptions of their appearance and&nbsp;development. In this paper, I will therefore&nbsp;demonstrate how 3D-GIS has the capabilities to&nbsp;change this. For my ongoing PhD research, I am&nbsp;introducing 3D-GIS as a new computational tool for&nbsp;producing 3 D representations of estate landscapes but&nbsp;also to subsequently provide the geographical and&nbsp;historical context to analyse the visual experience&nbsp;within them. This methodology will contribute to not&nbsp;only the study of designed landscapes but of historic&nbsp;landscapes generally.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Review</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In the study of designed landscapes, country houses, gardens, parks, and the wider estate landscape&nbsp;have been individually and collectively explored and&nbsp;analysed. This is evident from the literature produced&nbsp;in disciplines such as literary history, art history,&nbsp;architectural history, garden history, archaeology,&nbsp;geography, and landscape history. Whilst each&nbsp;approach has its own merits, a noticeable lack of&nbsp;collaboration and acknowledgement of alternative&nbsp;methods has created a “disciplinary vacuum”&nbsp;(Spooner, 2010, p.7). In my research, landscape&nbsp;history is the leading discipline, but it also embraces&nbsp;the contributions of the other disciplines, thus&nbsp;creating an altogether multidisciplinary approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our current understanding is predominantly based on research into well-documented and surviving&nbsp;estates. Consequently, there is a bias against sites&nbsp;which no longer survive or are lacking in evidence.&nbsp;Additionally, they are analysed separately from the&nbsp;wider landscape, which is frequently overlooked&nbsp;despite its significant bearing on the development and&nbsp;utilisation of designed landscapes. Although its&nbsp;contributions have been mentioned, the wider&nbsp;landscape has not been examined in detailed&nbsp;concordance with designed landscapes (Dix, 2011,&nbsp;p.152).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result, little research exists into how individual estates were experienced within their landscape&nbsp;context. Whilst the history of the senses, experiences&nbsp;and attitudes towards the landscape have been&nbsp;researched (Rippon, 2012; Hamilakis, 2013; Whyte,&nbsp;2015), the examination and application of these&nbsp;concepts to historic landscapes, including designed&nbsp;landscapes, is minimal. Therefore, a greater&nbsp;understanding of contemporaries’ perceptions and&nbsp;experiences of designed landscapes can be reached by&nbsp;ascertaining how such notions were applied to&nbsp;individual estates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, these issues will be addressed and a solution provided. This project utilises computer&nbsp;science as a conduit to address the many disciplines&nbsp;already featuring in the study of designed landscapes.&nbsp;Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is becoming&nbsp;increasingly popular in the spatial humanities,&nbsp;particularly historical and landscape studies (Gregory&nbsp;and Geddes, 2014; Knowles (ed.), 2002), but few have&nbsp;used GIS to analyse individual designed landscapes&nbsp;(Dalton, 2012) and ‘prospects’ within them (Spooner,&nbsp;2009). Furthermore, 2D-GIS is typically used, which&nbsp;does not provide a suitable perspective for&nbsp;comprehending the intended experience within these&nbsp;landscapes. On the other hand, Computer Aided&nbsp;Design (CAD) can digitally restore lost landscapes&nbsp;(Virtual Past, n.d.), including designed landscapes&nbsp;(Urmston and Historic England, n.d.), thus providing&nbsp;equal opportunity for their examination alongside&nbsp;surviving specimens. However, the essential&nbsp;difference between GIS and CAD is the handling of&nbsp;spatial data, and CAD is unable to conduct further&nbsp;spatial analysis (Abdul-Rahman and Pilouk, 2007,&nbsp;pp.4-5). Therefore, by incorporating CAD into a GIS&nbsp;environment, 3D-GIS can provide a more immersive&nbsp;perspective for the analyst to explore and analyse&nbsp;these landscapes more appropriately and effectively.&nbsp;3D-GIS is, therefore, a promising approach for the&nbsp;study of historic landscapes. Regarding designed&nbsp;landscapes, the reconstructive capabilities of 3D-GIS&nbsp;have been demonstrated (de Boer et al., 2011).&nbsp;However, 3D-GIS has only more recently been trialled&nbsp;for the analysis of individual estates. This project&nbsp;builds upon my previous work, looking specifically at&nbsp;the 'prospect' with the use of ‘viewshed’ analysis&nbsp;(Stewart, 2015). By literally adding a new dimension,&nbsp;3D-GIS has great potential to improve our&nbsp;understanding of designed landscapes.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Case Study</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">In this paper, I will present a case study which demonstrates the potential of 3D-GIS. My work adopts&nbsp;a regional approach, focusing on Norfolk, Suffolk and&nbsp;Essex. I will present work from one of these&nbsp;geographical areas. The combination of the&nbsp;aforementioned disciplines will provide the&nbsp;foundations upon which the recreations within CAD&nbsp;and GIS can be supported. This will involve the&nbsp;utilisation of polygons and imported CAD models,&nbsp;based on data extracted from geo-referenced&nbsp;contemporary maps, architectural plans, earthwork&nbsp;plans, fieldwork and archaeological surveys, alongside&nbsp;a range of qualitative historical documents, including&nbsp;estate accounts, inventories and contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Once digitally recreated in 3D-GIS, the estate along with its landscape context can then be subjected to&nbsp;further spatial analysis. For the purposes of this study,&nbsp;the visibility of a ‘prospect’ can be ascertained using&nbsp;‘viewshed’ analysis. To calculate this, topographical&nbsp;data produced by LIDAR is required, with&nbsp;amendments to replicate the historic landscape&nbsp;recreated in 3D-GIS. Viewshed analyses are then&nbsp;conducted from predetermined vantage points.&nbsp;Landowners ensured that ‘prospects’ could be enjoyed&nbsp;from certain places within their estates, such as the&nbsp;piano nobile of the country house, the rooftop, and&nbsp;from structures and landscape features within the&nbsp;grounds of the estate. Coupled with animations,&nbsp;whereby the act of movement throughout the&nbsp;landscape can be generated, the ‘prospects’ that&nbsp;contemporaries experienced can be recreated from&nbsp;these positions within the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, the results can be interpreted in light of the evidence analysed using ‘reception theory’; the&nbsp;creativity and reactivity of individuals in response to&nbsp;certain works (McGregor and White, 1990, p.1). This&nbsp;will focus on each individual landowner’s possessions,&nbsp;such as published texts or artwork, but also personal&nbsp;correspondence, including letters and diaries. This&nbsp;research will utilise reception theory, which has not&nbsp;yet fully implemented into the study of designed&nbsp;landscapes (Hunt, 2013, p.7), in order to ascertain&nbsp;contemporary ‘perspectives’ towards these&nbsp;landscapes through the ‘prospects’ experienced within&nbsp;them. I will present the findings from this case study.&nbsp;This will demonstrate not only the synthesis of the&nbsp;approaches and resources addressed, but will provide&nbsp;the best opportunity to analyse the visual experience&nbsp;and thus improve our understanding of sixteenth- and&nbsp;seventeenth-century designed landscapes.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The potential of 3D-GIS to rekindle the analysis of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century designed&nbsp;landscapes will be evident. The results from this case&nbsp;study, as part of a larger study, will help to explore and&nbsp;examine what these landowners’ visual perceptions&nbsp;were. Subsequently, our understanding will improve&nbsp;regarding how individual landscape designs have been&nbsp;influenced by their landowners’ thoughts and ideas,&nbsp;and the extent of their individuality or conformity to&nbsp;contemporary fashions in landscape design and&nbsp;appreciation. My project will progress research into&nbsp;designed landscapes whilst demonstrating the&nbsp;methodological benefits of 3D-GIS. As a virtual&nbsp;environment, analytical tool, and database, this&nbsp;approach can subsequently contribute to studies in&nbsp;landscape conservation, heritage management and&nbsp;outreach activities, with scope to benefit research&nbsp;within other areas of the spatial and digital&nbsp;humanities.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
