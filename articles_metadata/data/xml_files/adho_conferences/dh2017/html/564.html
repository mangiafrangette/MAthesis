<p><span class="font3">Over the last five years, research computing has undergone a shift from focusing on running&nbsp;infrastructure for highly technical researchers,&nbsp;primarily in the sciences, to supporting medium- to&nbsp;large-scale computational needs across a wide range&nbsp;of disciplines, where practitioners fall across the&nbsp;spectrum of technical proficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This shift in approach has opened up new opportunities, both for scholars whose research&nbsp;questions are facilitated by computationally intensive&nbsp;algorithms (e.g. photogrammetry, natural language&nbsp;processing, OCR at scale), and for humanists in&nbsp;support positions that require translation between&nbsp;technical and non-technical audiences. This panel will&nbsp;discuss opportunities for research and career&nbsp;development through the perspectives of research IT&nbsp;staff whose backgrounds in both humanistic inquiry&nbsp;and computational and digital methodologies enable&nbsp;them to engage in outreach to, training of, and support&nbsp;for humanities researchers. It will also provide&nbsp;practical suggestions for humanists who could benefit&nbsp;from research computing resources but find it difficult&nbsp;to navigate the expectations of research IT&nbsp;organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The communication, writing, and teaching skills cultivated through an advanced degree in the&nbsp;humanities align with employment trends in research&nbsp;IT groups. While some familiarity and comfort with&nbsp;computation is generally a requirement for working in&nbsp;research IT, advanced programming or system&nbsp;administration skills are crucial for a minority of&nbsp;positions in these groups. As the mandate of research&nbsp;computing groups has expanded, it has become&nbsp;increasingly clear that successful research computing&nbsp;programs require documentation that is&nbsp;comprehensible to a non-technical audience, hands-on&nbsp;workshops for non-specialists, and staff capable of&nbsp;understanding the fundamentals of researchers’ work&nbsp;and identifying effective approaches to meeting their&nbsp;computation needs. To that end, in 2014 the US&nbsp;National Science Foundation funded the Advanced&nbsp;Cyberinfrastructure - Research and Education&nbsp;Facilitators (ACI-REF) program, which developed a&nbsp;cohort of computation “facilitators” across a number&nbsp;of universities who could &quot;maximize the impact of&nbsp;investment in research computing&quot; by “assisting]&nbsp;researchers in leveraging ACI resources for&nbsp;themselves” and sharing solutions among&nbsp;participating institutions (NSF 2014). This approach&nbsp;to providing support has been highly influential&nbsp;among campus research IT organizations, and related&nbsp;workshops such as the ACI-REF virtual residency&nbsp;(featuring plenaries such as “Effective&nbsp;Communication: How to talk to researchers about&nbsp;their research” and “Writing Grant Proposals”) have&nbsp;drawn large crowds (Neeman et al. 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Similarly, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), funded by the&nbsp;National Science Foundation, has begun specifically&nbsp;reaching out to disciplines that have been typically&nbsp;under-represented in the high performance&nbsp;computing arena, including those in the humanities.&nbsp;XSEDE has a program called Extended Collaborative&nbsp;Support Services (ECSS) that partners humanities&nbsp;scholars and others from under-represented areas&nbsp;with computing professionals who can help them&nbsp;achieve their desired research objectives (Wilkins-Diehr et al. 2016). This has been both necessary and&nbsp;fruitful particularly in areas that are focused on data&nbsp;analytics (such as video analysis, image analysis,&nbsp;network analysis, etc.), as opposed to the more&nbsp;traditional simulation and modeling done by scientists&nbsp;and engineers. XSEDE’s Novel and Innovative Projects&nbsp;group includes a specialist in digital humanities, as&nbsp;well as specialists in pertinent related areas such as&nbsp;big data analytics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Along the same lines, in January 2014, Compute Canada hired a full-time Digital Humanities&nbsp;coordinator to lead a national team supporting&nbsp;researchers wanting to engage with national advanced&nbsp;research computing (ARC) resources. Compute&nbsp;Canada, a national non-profit organization&nbsp;incorporated in 2012, plans and oversees panCanadian ARC resources used for big data analysis,&nbsp;visualization, data storage, software, portals and&nbsp;platforms for research computing serving Canadian&nbsp;academic and research institutes. The national&nbsp;support team for Compute Canada now consists of the&nbsp;full-time DH coordinator, and a large geographically&nbsp;dispersed team that meets bi-weekly to coordinate&nbsp;national initiatives like training at the Digital&nbsp;Humanities Summer Institute and national&nbsp;competitions such as the recent partnership between&nbsp;Compute Canada and the Canadian Social Sciences and&nbsp;Humanities Research Council. The DH team also meets&nbsp;locally with humanities researchers at their own&nbsp;institutions to help them leverage national&nbsp;infrastructure, and shares experiences and advice&nbsp;back to the national team to help in developing tools,&nbsp;services, and training opportunities that will benefit&nbsp;the national DH community (Simpson 2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the interesting ramifications of these changes in IT staffing trends is the addition of&nbsp;humanists to IT-based groups in high performance&nbsp;computing, cyberinfrastructure, visualization, and&nbsp;data architectures--humanists who are called upon to&nbsp;maintain both a deep understanding of computational&nbsp;systems, as well as track the needs of scholars in the&nbsp;humanities, which tend to be quite different from&nbsp;researchers in the “hard” or social sciences. Often, they&nbsp;are the lone humanist in a group dominated by&nbsp;engineers and computer scientists. There is a clear&nbsp;need and desire to expand the use of computational&nbsp;resources into &quot;non-traditional&quot; (i.e., non-hard-sciences) disciplines, both to justify an institutionwide investment in research computing, and as a way&nbsp;of building institutional capacity for supporting digital&nbsp;humanities scholarship (as described in the&nbsp;forthcoming 2017 ECAR/CNI white paper on&nbsp;institutional digital humanities support). Nonetheless,&nbsp;institutions are struggling with translating their&nbsp;services into comprehensible and relevant offerings&nbsp;for humanities researchers. Finding effective means of&nbsp;supporting these researchers within the traditional&nbsp;model of the research IT group has also been a&nbsp;challenge, given the ways that it differs from library-based support models with which scholars are more&nbsp;familiar. Panelists will reflect on projects they have&nbsp;worked on that successfully bridged the humanities-research computing divide, to the benefit of both&nbsp;groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As one example, at Indiana University, a workflow for teaching text analysis with R has been developed&nbsp;that uses web-based Shiny scripts to introduce an&nbsp;algorithm, highly annotated RNotebooks explaining&nbsp;each line of code, lightly annotated RScripts allowing&nbsp;for remixing and adaptation, and, finally, RScripts to&nbsp;leverage multicore environments. The scripts use data&nbsp;both from literature and Twitter, and these tutorials&nbsp;consistently draw the highest attendance in the series&nbsp;DH for Humanists, held throughout the semester.&nbsp;Individual research projects using more sophisticated&nbsp;algorithms such as NER and LDA have also grown out&nbsp;of this project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As another example, at the University of Chicago, the recently-developed Visual Text Explorer provides&nbsp;a new type of framework for reading texts along with&nbsp;a range of user-customizable analytics, allowing for&nbsp;simultaneous close and distant reading. Other&nbsp;humanities research computing projects include web-based data-driven animated interactive mapping&nbsp;systems, tools for comparative sequence analysis&nbsp;across literary corpora, and automated aggregators of&nbsp;ranges of specific secondary data sources to inform the&nbsp;reading of specific texts/types of texts, all of which&nbsp;require no knowledge of computer programming by&nbsp;the user but nonetheless leverage research computing&nbsp;resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At UC Berkeley, 3D modeling work by Near Eastern Studies scholars that uses photogrammetry software&nbsp;running on the high-performance compute cluster has&nbsp;been helpful for testing new Graphics Processing Unit&nbsp;(GPU) nodes in the cluster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, panelists will provide recommendations for how humanities scholars can translate their research&nbsp;projects in ways that will make them more&nbsp;comprehensible and compelling for institutional&nbsp;research IT groups that may not have a humanist on&nbsp;their support staff.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Panel participants</span></h2>
