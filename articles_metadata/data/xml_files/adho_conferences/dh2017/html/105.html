<p><span class="font3">This proposal describes a method of collecting and managing the name of a person from historical materials related to Japanese history from the 8th century&nbsp;until the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are several tasks related to personal name such as collecting, identifying, representing. For historians and researchers, the recording and management&nbsp;of a personal name is an integral (and unavoidable)&nbsp;task. In Japan, historical materials are held by both a&nbsp;public institute and a private house in which they are&nbsp;found. Because there are no catalogs listing all of the&nbsp;material, the research staff at our institute (the Historiographical Institute of the University of Tokyo) spend&nbsp;several weeks each year investigating and examining&nbsp;historical records kept in Japan and abroad. The staff&nbsp;has over 100 years' combined experience conducting&nbsp;these examinations, and their journeys have taken&nbsp;them all over Japan as well as to many different parts&nbsp;of the globe. Ho (2015) and Bol et al (2015) introduced&nbsp;a method of personal name management in the context&nbsp;of Chinese historical materials (like a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(difang-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">zhi)&quot;) that used the China Biographical Database (CBCB) as a biographical dictionary. In Japanese history, there is no such exhaustive encyclopedia or dictionary for a name of a historical person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A personal name appears in a variety of historical materials such as an old diary, an old document, a classical book, a family pedigree, a document related to appointment, and so on. The materials contain diverse&nbsp;name representations, such as a real name or an original name, a nickname, an epithet, a role name which&nbsp;indicates a person, and a Kao (which is a stylized signature or a mark), among others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We constructed a repository which can store a collection containing both the names and the historical materials in which they appear. There are several different representations of a name in each material type.&nbsp;In order to represent and preserve these variations,&nbsp;the repository can store a variety of name data regardless of differences in data schema. In order to ensure&nbsp;efficient data-searching, we prepared common&nbsp;metadata that consist of an identifier, a personal name,&nbsp;a correspondence of the name, a related resource, a database where the name has been stored if such a database has already been constructed and the date on&nbsp;which the name appeared in the resource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name data can be expressed as RDF data and searched with SPARQL in the repository which provides an RDF store and a SPARQL endpoint. Furthermore, the repository can integrate the name data regardless of differences among personal name&nbsp;metadata schema, and provide the result of the integration. In addition, we will show an application for&nbsp;representing the outcomes of search results.</span></p>
