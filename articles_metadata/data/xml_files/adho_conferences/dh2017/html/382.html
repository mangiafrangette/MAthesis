<p><span class="font3">This paper explores university and community partnerships to preserve and provide online access to&nbsp;LGBTQ cultural heritage materials, focusing in&nbsp;particular on projects that improve the accessibility&nbsp;and profile of transgender materials in traditional gay&nbsp;and lesbian organizations. The paper reflects on the&nbsp;promises and challenges of pursuing trans-positive,&nbsp;activist digital humanities projects within the context&nbsp;of a historically cis gay and lesbian analogue archive.&nbsp;How have anxieties surrounding digital&nbsp;transformations in the archive become enmeshed in&nbsp;concerns about changing understandings of sexual&nbsp;and gender embodiment within the LGBTQ&nbsp;community? How has the queer archive’s shift to the&nbsp;digital engendered not only “privacy anxieties”&nbsp;(Chenier 2015) but also identity anxieties, as a new&nbsp;generation of non-binary and trans volunteers,&nbsp;scholars, and activists reshape the meanings of&nbsp;“LGBTQ” within the community archive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The paper reports on the first three years of the LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory&nbsp;(<a href="http://lgbtqdigitalcollaboratory.org/">http://lgbtqdigitalcollaboratory.org/</a>), a five-year&nbsp;SSHRC-funded project directed by Elspeth Brown at&nbsp;the University of Toronto. The Collaboratory works in&nbsp;partnership with the Canadian Lesbian and Gay&nbsp;Archives (<a href="http://clga.ca/">http://clga.ca/</a>), a volunteer-run,&nbsp;community archives, to design and implement inhouse digitization programs. This project has invested&nbsp;significant labour and technology into the acquisition&nbsp;and digitization of transgender materials underrepresented in the CLGA’s collection, and in&nbsp;historically “Gay and Lesbian” community archives&nbsp;more broadly (Rawson 2009; Morris and Rawson,&nbsp;2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper will outline the technical and political concerns behind two Collaboratory/CLGA partnership&nbsp;projects aimed at improving access to trans materials:&nbsp;1) The development of an audio digitization station for&nbsp;oral history cassette tapes; and 2) the processing and&nbsp;digitization of transsexual artist and activist Mirha-Soleil Ross’ personal papers. We argue that the&nbsp;planning and implementation of digitization initiatives&nbsp;is a significant catalyst for broader, mandate-driven&nbsp;shifts within LGBTQ cultural heritage organizations.&nbsp;We argue that this is particularly the case when these&nbsp;partnerships drawn on humanities-based approaches&nbsp;that understand the archive as a worlding technology&nbsp;(Stoler 2010, Eichhorn 2013) caught up within&nbsp;broader conflicts that challenge and divide LGBT&nbsp;spaces. More specifically, the paper outlines how&nbsp;university partners can support the development of&nbsp;digital infrastructures in community-based,&nbsp;volunteer-engaged contexts. We suggest that this&nbsp;labour can be understood as part of a broader politics&nbsp;of digitization that must be approached with care&nbsp;when forming community partnerships. We&nbsp;understand digitization as a wide-ranging process that&nbsp;transcends the conversion of “analog” materials into&nbsp;digital formats: digitization has the potential to shift&nbsp;economies of attention in social movement&nbsp;organizations undergoing transition (McKinney&nbsp;2015).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theoretically, the paper engages with queer, trans, and feminist approaches to digital archives (Chenier&nbsp;2009; McLeod et al, 2014; Matte 2015). In particular,&nbsp;we draw on scholarship that has considered how trans&nbsp;materials have the potential to confound, challenge,&nbsp;and ultimately re-formulate archival systems (Brown&nbsp;2015; Roberto 2011). Here, digital spaces and&nbsp;technologies provide historical “worldmaking”&nbsp;opportunities often denied to trans histories within&nbsp;“LGBT” spaces (Rawson 2014). Emphasizing the&nbsp;relationship between “trans” and movement (Stryker,&nbsp;Currah, Moore 2008), we consider the moments where&nbsp;digitization meets trans as potentially productive but&nbsp;also acrimonious challenges for LGBT archives&nbsp;primarily concerned, in practice, with GayandLesbian&nbsp;(Noble 2006) cultural memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The paper covers two case studies from the Collaboratory/CLGA project, and will explain the&nbsp;technical questions and organizational concerns&nbsp;behind the design and roll-out of both projects in&nbsp;order to support the argument outlined above.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Audio Digitization Station</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Begun in year one (2014), this station sought to develop a technologically accessible digitization&nbsp;solution for audio-cassette tapes, most of which&nbsp;contain oral histories produced in the 1980s and 90s.&nbsp;We will outline the accessibility concerns at the heart&nbsp;of this project, including how the audio digitization&nbsp;protocol the project established sought to build&nbsp;organizational comfort with digitization practices by&nbsp;integrating the system with existing database&nbsp;infrastructures and ways of organizing volunteer&nbsp;labour at the archives. This part of the paper will also&nbsp;address how the Collaboratory identified trans audio&nbsp;collections within the archives, and will touch on some&nbsp;of the challenges in locating these materials. This&nbsp;material will be useful for humanities scholars in&nbsp;sexuality and gender studies who are concerned about&nbsp;creating digital preservation plans for audio-based&nbsp;primary source materials they might collect or create.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Mirha-Soleil Ross Papers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Begun in year three (2016), this project is working to process, digitize, and improve access to the personal&nbsp;papers of Mirha-Soleil Ross, one of the most significant&nbsp;figures in transgender activism and cultural&nbsp;production in Canada. Donated to the archives in 2008,&nbsp;this large collection had not yet been processed by&nbsp;archives volunteers and as result, was mostly&nbsp;inaccessible to researchers. We are working in&nbsp;collaboration with Ms. Ross, and several members of&nbsp;the trans community, to organize these materials,&nbsp;determine access restrictions for sensitive content,&nbsp;create an online finding aid, and an online digital&nbsp;collection using the Omeka platform, which will&nbsp;sample from the larger volume of material. This part&nbsp;of the paper asks how digitization might provide an&nbsp;opportunity to repair damaged relationships between&nbsp;LGBT organizations and trans communities. It also&nbsp;considers some of the unique privacy concerns&nbsp;scholars must consider when providing online access&nbsp;to materials that document trans lives.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
