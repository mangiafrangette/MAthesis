<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian</span><span class="font5"> is a best-selling science fiction novel by Andy Weir that became a hit film in 2015. The novel&nbsp;exists in two versions, or variants: Weir self-published&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian</span><span class="font5"> on his personal website in 2011&nbsp;(hereafter, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Martianl”)</span><span class="font5"> and began selling it on&nbsp;Amazon.com in 2012. Crown Publishing subsequently&nbsp;bought the rights, edited the book, and re-released it&nbsp;(hereafter, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Martian2”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The research presented here investigates what exactly changed when </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian</span><span class="font5"> got edited. At first&nbsp;glance, the two versions appear essentially the same,&nbsp;with no major changes to plot, character, or structure.&nbsp;A closer look using a combination of quantitative and&nbsp;qualitative methods, however, reveals a number of&nbsp;noteworthy changes, as well as notable changes that&nbsp;result from thousands of seemingly minor copyedits.&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Aims</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The aim of our research is to identify what changed between the two variants of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian</span><span class="font5"> using a&nbsp;combination of close reading and digital methods,&nbsp;analyze why those changes are important, and&nbsp;propose a methodology for comparing self-published&nbsp;and later-edited novels, an increasingly common&nbsp;phenomenon. We hypothesize that the editing process&nbsp;of a leading publishing house results in a novel that is&nbsp;more &quot;mainstream&quot;, i.e. socialised, domesticated, and&nbsp;appealing to a general audience. In order to test this&nbsp;hypothesis, we explore a range of aspects, including&nbsp;style, content, and character. Our research also aims to&nbsp;bring a critical perspective to the strengths and&nbsp;weaknesses of a variety of qualitative and technical&nbsp;methods in identifying the edits and assessing their&nbsp;importance.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Related Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to work in digital genetic criticism (e.g. van Hulle 2008), a small number of studies use digital&nbsp;methods to explore variants of contemporary fiction.&nbsp;Yufang Ho (2011) compared the 1966 and revised&nbsp;1977 versions of John Fowles’s novel </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Magus,</span><span class="font5"> while&nbsp;Martin Paul Eve (2016) looked at differences in the US&nbsp;and UK versions of David Mitchell’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cloud Atlas.</span><span class="font5"> As&nbsp;both Ho and Eve use different methods from one&nbsp;another and from us, it appears that no standard&nbsp;method has emerged so far for this type of research.&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Data</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The data used for this research is primarily two plain text files of the variants of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian. Martianl</span><span class="font5"> was&nbsp;obtained in PDF format from Andy Weir’s website.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2</span><span class="font5"> was obtained by scanning a print copy,&nbsp;performing OCR with manual corrections. We consider&nbsp;this our best option given the legal issues regarding&nbsp;text protected by copyright.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Methods and Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Basic collation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We used the Wdiff frontend to the “diff” algorithm (Hunt &amp; McIlroy 1975) to produce a collated version of&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martianl</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2</span><span class="font5"> and assess the number and&nbsp;extent of the edits. We then used bespoke Python&nbsp;scripts to classify the edits identified by Wdiff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We found a total of 5146 edits were made to the novel. While 92% of the 101,000 words in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martianl&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">remain unchanged in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2,</span><span class="font5"> the remaining 8% of&nbsp;the words undergo some type of edit, whether they are&nbsp;deleted or modified (Figure 1). The sheer number of&nbsp;edits calls for automatic means to classify them and&nbsp;detect any patterns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Figure 1: Visualization of edits to The Martian as grouped by Wdiff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Automatic Classification of Edits</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Edits were automatically classified into two broad categories: script-detectable copyedits, and all other&nbsp;edits. Script-detectable copyedits includes changes in&nbsp;capitalization, whitespace, hyphenation, spelling of&nbsp;numbers, abbreviations, or combinations thereof&nbsp;(Figure 2). All other edits were classified as insertion,&nbsp;deletion, expansion or condensation and as “minor” or&nbsp;“major”, depending on the Levenshtein distance&nbsp;(Figure 3). Of the 5146 edits, 2863 (or 55%) were&nbsp;script-detectable copyedits, while 2283 (or 45%)&nbsp;comprised the rest. The code used as well as the&nbsp;collation data obtained are available on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">GitHub</span><span class="font5">.</span></p><img src="317_files/317-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:136pt;"/>

When Watney narrates, the hundreds of&nbsp;misspellings, numerals, and scientific abbreviations in&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martianl</span><span class="font5"> support the fiction that he is a scientist&nbsp;working in extreme conditions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2</span><span class="font5"> increases&nbsp;readability but eliminates the stylistic realism of&nbsp;Watney’s text. When Weir uses, for instance, numerals&nbsp;in the dialogue of other characters, the effect can be&nbsp;jarring. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2</span><span class="font5"> corrects this for the better.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Detecting transpositions with CollateX</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wdiff does not detect transpositions, or text that has been moved to a different location in the novel.&nbsp;Using CollateX (Dekker &amp; Middell 2011) as described&nbsp;in Schoch (2016) revealed a total of 126&nbsp;transpositions. Twenty-eight (or 22%) involve&nbsp;punctuation and should be considered artefacts of the&nbsp;method; 43 (or 34%) represent transpositions of a&nbsp;single word, showing stylistic preferences on the&nbsp;word-order level; 55 (or 44%) concern multi-word&nbsp;expressions which change the overall construction of a&nbsp;sentence or paragraph more substantially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Figure 5 shows a relatively minor transposition appearing in combination with a contraction of a&nbsp;sentence.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font6">Cumulative Effect of the Script-Identifiable Copyedits</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font5">Taken together, the 2863 script-identifiable copyedits have substantial effects upon the text. Weir’s&nbsp;many misspellings and misuse of hyphens and&nbsp;capitalization are corrected. Numbers in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martianl</span><span class="font5"> are&nbsp;overwhelmingly written numerically, and 765 of these&nbsp;become words in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2,</span><span class="font5"> e.g. “8” becomes “eight”.&nbsp;We found 231 instances of edits involving&nbsp;abbreviations, e.g. “L” becomes “liters”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The copyedits work together in different ways when they appear in protagonist Mark Watney’s</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><img src="317_files/317-4.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:279pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Figure 5: An example of a transposition identified by CollateX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We conclude that, quantitatively and qualitatively, transpositions were not a major part of the edit to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Martian.</span><span class="font5"> However, future work could apply the same&nbsp;method to other, comparable variants of novels to gain&nbsp;better reference points.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Figure 6: examples of toned-down profanity in the editing of The Martian</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additionally, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martianl</span><span class="font5"> contains an epilogue that is completely cut in the edit. It portrays Watney, back on&nbsp;Earth, being openly and profanely rude to a young fan.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2,</span><span class="font5"> meanwhile, text is added to have Watney&nbsp;express gracious appreciation for all the parties&nbsp;involved in his rescue and a widespread faith in human&nbsp;nature. The edit therefore alters the tone of the ending&nbsp;substantially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We believe that all of these changes, analyzed together with close reading, serve to align Watney's&nbsp;character with our overall hypothesized goal of the&nbsp;edit: to make Watney more “relatable,” “nice,” and&nbsp;“human,” and thus to appeal to a wider audience.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font6">Edits Over the Course of the Novel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we grouped the other edits, placed them into a spreadsheet, and manually inspected them, a&nbsp;number of thematic and stylistic shifts between&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martianl</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2</span><span class="font5"> became apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Profanity is a key stylistic feature of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian </span><span class="font5">that is substantially cut and softened by the edit.&nbsp;Words like “fuck” and “shit” are substantially reduced&nbsp;(by about 33% and 15%, respectively), while&nbsp;numerous other words and phrases are softened with&nbsp;“lesser” profanity or simple non-profanity (e.g. “the&nbsp;shit hits the fan” becomes “all hell breaks loose”).&nbsp;Figure 6 shows a selection of these edits. Similarly,&nbsp;crude and sophomoric humor is cut in key instances.&nbsp;The plot of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian</span><span class="font5"> revolves around solving one&nbsp;problem after another to rescue an astronaut, Mark&nbsp;Watney, stranded on Mars, while relatively little text is&nbsp;devoted to Watney's emotions or inner world. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Martian2,</span><span class="font5"> however, Watney expresses significantly&nbsp;more emotion: he misses his family and friends more</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patterns in the edits related to textual progression are revealed by measuring the absolute Levenshtein&nbsp;distance of the script-identifiable copyedits and other&nbsp;edits line by line (Levenshtein distance is a metric for&nbsp;measuring the difference between two sequences, see&nbsp;Navarro 2001).</span></p><img src="317_files/317-6.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:121pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Figure 7: Sum of absolute Levenshtein distance per line over textual progression (script-identifiable copyedits in red,&nbsp;other edits in blue).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Figure 7 shows the sum of the absolute Levenshtein distances for each line of the novel (with </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Savitzky-Golay smoothing</span><span class="font5"> applied). The graph shows the&nbsp;substantial modifications to the ending of the novel,&nbsp;but also a large number of locations with smaller but&nbsp;nonetheless above-average modifications.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion and Further Research</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">We have identified and analyzed a number of key features that emerged from the editing of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">notably on the level of style and character, which&nbsp;combine to make the novel more appealing to a wider&nbsp;audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ongoing research into </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Martian</span><span class="font5"> concerns the relative frequency and function of parts of speech,&nbsp;quantifying the amount of syntactic change, and the&nbsp;legal issues affecting the obtaining and processing of&nbsp;the texts. We hope to present these additional findings&nbsp;in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for our typology of edits, an established methodology for classifying edits in the companion&nbsp;fields of textual analysis and scholarly editing is the&nbsp;distinction between the “accidentals” and&nbsp;“substantives” used by the Greg-Bowers tradition and&nbsp;included in the MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions’&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions</span><span class="font5"> (Modern&nbsp;Language Association, 2011). Scholars are not&nbsp;unanimous, however, in supporting this. G. Thomas&nbsp;Tanselle, for instance, found these terms &quot;misleading&nbsp;and often untenable in their implication of a firm&nbsp;distinction in all cases” (Greetham 1992, pp.335-336).&nbsp;Further, there appears to be no widely-applicable&nbsp;typology of edits in digital scholarly editing and&nbsp;collation, with different materials calling for different&nbsp;typologies (see TEI-L 2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our typology of edits departs from previously proposed ones by focusing entirely on types which can&nbsp;be identified automatically, based on surface features.&nbsp;While limited in scope and excluding any semantic&nbsp;criteria, our typology may serve as a first approach to&nbsp;the edits of any text and allow quantitative comparison&nbsp;of some key phenomena. We believe that our method&nbsp;could be applied to other variants of fiction — by itself&nbsp;or incorporated alongside another taxonomy,&nbsp;including accidentals/substantives — particularly to&nbsp;novels which begin as self-published works but are&nbsp;later edited and re-released, an increasingly important&nbsp;phenomenon in contemporary fiction.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
