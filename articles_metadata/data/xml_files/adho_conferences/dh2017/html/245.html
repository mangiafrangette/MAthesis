<p><span class="font0">The Civil War Governors of Kentucky Digital Documentary Edition (CWG-K) is a freely-accessible online collection of historical documents associated with the&nbsp;chief executives of the state, 1860-1865. Yet CWG-K is&nbsp;about far more than the five governors. Uniquely positioned to view, reflect upon, and intervene in the lives&nbsp;of thousands of people experiencing the traumas of&nbsp;civil war, Kentucky's chief executives stood at the intersection of public and private life during an era that&nbsp;transformed the nation. Collectively, their papers provide a multi-faceted lens through which we can recover and understand more fully the lives of countless&nbsp;men, women, and children who have been heretofore&nbsp;both historically undocumented and archivally silenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After five years of active editorial work, CWG-K</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">published the facsimiles and transcriptions of 10,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">documents </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">online</span><span class="font0"> in 2016. Driven primarily by keyword searches and limited metadata faceting, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Early Access</span><span class="font0"> is a digital evolution of the printed letterpress edition and its index. The content is interpretatively rich and suggestive and can be queried and sorted in a&nbsp;number of ways, but the experience is still ultimately&nbsp;linear. The ultimate goal of CWG-K, however, is to create a digital research environment within which a user&nbsp;can encounter the past multi-dimensionally through&nbsp;the documents and the powerful annotation network&nbsp;that links the documents together through the individuals, institutions, and places found in the texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CWG-K's true impact on scholarship, however, is through annotation. To the extent possible given the&nbsp;restrictions and biases of the historical record, CWG-K&nbsp;is identifying, researching, and linking together every&nbsp;person, place, and organization found in its documents. This web consisting of hundreds of thousands&nbsp;of networked nodes will dramatically expand the number of historical actors, show scholars new patterns&nbsp;and hidden relationships, and recognize the humanity&nbsp;and agency of historically marginalized people. The&nbsp;network of identified and annotated people, places,&nbsp;businesses, government agencies, and military units,&nbsp;will come as close as possible to a historical reconstruction of mid-nineteenth century society as it was&nbsp;lived and experienced in wartime Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this document-driven historical ecosystem, users can explore intuitively—moving seamlessly through seemingly disparate historical themes,&nbsp;events, and topics; breaking into the plane of social&nbsp;and geographic space to understand the deep patterns&nbsp;that underlay the issues raised in a text or set of texts;&nbsp;and moving forward and backwards through time to&nbsp;put this reconstructed historical world in motion and&nbsp;understand patterns of ebb and flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Phase II of the project (September 2016-September 2017) extends the edition into network visualization.&nbsp;Instead of reinventing the wheel for all the different&nbsp;functionality that an editorial annotation tool needs to&nbsp;have, we have taken the best existing open-source&nbsp;tools and integrated them to achieve our goals. TEI-XML files are exported from the transcription and control file tool DocTracker, published on the Omeka-powered Early Access website, and checked into a&nbsp;Github repository. Research assistants use Hy-pothes.is to identify entities within each document on&nbsp;the Early Access site. The custom-built MashBill tool&nbsp;queries Hypothes.is for those annotations, allowing research assistants to identify references to entities and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">build relationships between initially coocurring entities and document biographical research from external sources. MashBill then uses the annotations and identifications to update the TEI documents automatically with the appropriate persName/or-gName/placeName references and re-publishing them&nbsp;to Github.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the open source tool MashBill, CWG-K makes an important contribution to network analysis in digital&nbsp;humanities. With a few exceptions network analysis is&nbsp;still dominated by network construction based on&nbsp;cooccurence of entities within documents. These entities are most frequently created by automated named&nbsp;entity recognition performed on plaintext. CWG-K researcher's close reading of documents to extract entities allows for much accurate identification of entities.&nbsp;The use of Hypothes.is makes such human-powered&nbsp;entity recognition far more scalable than traditional&nbsp;manual tagging of TEI-XML. Rather than using pure&nbsp;cooccurence MashBill allows relationships to be defined by researchers consulting resources outside the&nbsp;documents of the edition. These relationships are then&nbsp;visualized with a D3.js visualization which is deeply&nbsp;linked to both the documents themselves as well as the&nbsp;articles written during the course of entity and relationship research on the people, places, and things.&nbsp;The open source MashBill tool may be reused for any&nbsp;TEI/Omeka project to reduce the effort and improve&nbsp;quality of entity identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the Civil War Governors of Kentucky Digital Documentary Edition is a project of the Kentucky Historical Society, it has always focused on public access.&nbsp;The development of MashBill and integration of the&nbsp;network visualization produced with that tool into the&nbsp;early access website will enable the public to discover&nbsp;the lives and stories of everyday people who interacted with the offices of the governors. Our synthesis&nbsp;of approaches and technologies provides an example&nbsp;other projects can benefit from, showing how to leverage open source tools and standards to efficiently&nbsp;identify and build network visualization in public digital editions.</span></p>
