<p><span class="font1">The Russian academic approach towards editing of the nineteenth-century classics, in general, inherits&nbsp;German critical editing tradition. Typically, the edition&nbsp;will include three basic sections: 1) critically prepared&nbsp;definitive text of the work, 2) full critical history with&nbsp;the list of all the discrepancies between its versions 3)&nbsp;commentaries including a description of the&nbsp;manuscript and printed sources of the text, history of&nbsp;its creation, a detailed historical and literary&nbsp;commentary based on all the existing research about&nbsp;it, and finally explanatory notes to the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the works of Dostoyevski, Chekhov, Turgenev and other XIX classics are published this way.O nly one&nbsp;of the 19th century classics still does not have his&nbsp;collected works academically edited. This exception is&nbsp;Pushkin, whose exclusive place in Russian culture can&nbsp;be compared to Shakespeare’s in English, Dante’s in&nbsp;Italian or Goethe’s in German culture. The reasons&nbsp;behind this phenomenon are simply historical. The&nbsp;first attempt to publish a complete critical edition of&nbsp;Pushkin's works was interrupted by the revolution&nbsp;and the civil war, and the second was distorted by the&nbsp;personal order of Stalin. The third attempt is being&nbsp;carried out now, when the government's interests&nbsp;disregard any cultural values. The work towards&nbsp;finally making this edition is conducted at the Institute&nbsp;of Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of&nbsp;Sciences (Pushkin House). Today there are only four&nbsp;volumes published but the amount of copies is 500 in&nbsp;average, and they are marketed almost exclusively in&nbsp;St. Petersburg and Moscow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The theme of this conference is Access. Low availability of any printed edition today can be easily&nbsp;compensated by publishing it online. However, when&nbsp;we speak about critical editions, the problem of&nbsp;accessibility obtains an entirely different aspect. To&nbsp;use all the information the existing critical edition of&nbsp;Pushkin's works provides, its readers should have a&nbsp;special philological training. and if they have one, in&nbsp;order to actually conduct any work with the materials&nbsp;provided they will require access to Pushkin's&nbsp;autographs, books, magazines of the Pushkin's era and&nbsp;to all researches and papers upon which the&nbsp;commentaries are based. And it goes without&nbsp;mentioning that readers are expected to have a grasp&nbsp;of the main cultural realities of Pushkin's epoch, and to&nbsp;be aware of Pushkin’s social and political&nbsp;surroundings. All this makes an anticipated number of&nbsp;readers for this edition only slightly higher than the&nbsp;number of experts who participated in its preparation.&nbsp;Unfortunately, all this can be applied to almost all&nbsp;annotated critical editions. Yet it is obvious that the&nbsp;information they contain can be interesting and useful&nbsp;for every reader. The question is how to make&nbsp;academic publication available for everyone without&nbsp;compromising the scope and depth of its material?&nbsp;And that is the main challenge that stands in front of&nbsp;Pushkin Digital Project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Developing this project we were thinking not only about how to publish Pushkin's manuscripts, their&nbsp;decipherment and critical descriptions along with the&nbsp;text and the commentary; our ambition was to create&nbsp;an edition that unlike its prototype, which required a&nbsp;certain scientific competence of its reader, would, on&nbsp;the contrary, be able to form such a competence. Our&nbsp;electronic publications were to be addressed not only&nbsp;to researchers and students, but to anyone who would&nbsp;like to have a deeper look into Pushkin’s world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To accomplish that goal, we chose a simple and understandable architecture, consisting of three main&nbsp;operational modes: Text - Commentaries -Manuscripts. Each of these three sections has an&nbsp;autonomous meaning, and could be the sole object for&nbsp;a special digital edition. However, within the&nbsp;framework of our project, it was imperative for all&nbsp;three parts to be closely linked and cross-referenced&nbsp;creating an informational entity, where the text, its&nbsp;history and its context are inseparable from each&nbsp;other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Text section of the edition contains the definitive text of the work with two main interacting&nbsp;tools. One tool gives the user the ability to read all the&nbsp;commentary notes upon the text (which may include&nbsp;some external links to music associated with the text&nbsp;and images relevant to this fragment). The other&nbsp;shows all the lines that had any variations along the&nbsp;creation of the text and links to the digitised sources of&nbsp;these variations in section Manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The section Manuscripts is a digital representation of autographs and/or printed sources with full&nbsp;transcription and the estimated chronological&nbsp;sequence of author's editings. When working with&nbsp;Pushkin's manuscripts, the presence of a full</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">transcription has a special value due to the extreme intricateness and illegibility of Pushkin's drafts (less&nbsp;than a dozen specialists in the world are able to read&nbsp;it). This section contains a detailed paleogeographic&nbsp;description of each manuscript together with the&nbsp;history of its creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Comment section - is the most voluminous section of the website. Academic historical and literary&nbsp;commentary on Pushkin's works is formed as a&nbsp;reflection and synthesis of all existing studies upon the&nbsp;subject (there is a special department of the Pushkin&nbsp;House dedicated to accounting, describing, and&nbsp;cataloging every book referring to Pushkin or his&nbsp;works (there is no digital version). In the paper&nbsp;edition, this section appears as a coherent and&nbsp;undivided text sometimes up to hundreds of pages.&nbsp;Without knowing its structure and contents in&nbsp;advance, an unprepared reader will easily get lost in it,</span></p>
