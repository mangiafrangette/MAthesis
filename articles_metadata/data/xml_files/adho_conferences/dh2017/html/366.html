<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nodegoat</span><span class="font2"> allows scholars to build datasets based on their own data model and offers relational modes&nbsp;of analysis with spatial and chronological forms of&nbsp;contextualisation. By combining these elements&nbsp;within one environment, scholars are able to instantly&nbsp;process, analyse and visualise complex datasets&nbsp;relationally, diachronically and spatially; trailblazing.&nbsp;nodegoat follows an object-oriented approach&nbsp;throughout its core functionalities. Borrowing from&nbsp;actor-network theory this means that people, events,&nbsp;artefacts, and sources are treated as equal: objects,&nbsp;and hierarchy depends solely on the composition of&nbsp;the network: relations. This object-oriented approach&nbsp;advocates the self-identification of individual objects&nbsp;and maps the correlation of objects within the&nbsp;collective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Research Environment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">nodegoat is a web-based research environment that facilitates an object-oriented form of data&nbsp;management with an integrated support for&nbsp;diachronic and spatial modes of analysis. This&nbsp;research environment has been developed to allow&nbsp;scholars to design custom relational database models.&nbsp;nodegoat dynamically combines functionalities of a&nbsp;database management system (e.g. Access/FileMaker)&nbsp;with visualisation possibilities (e.g. Gephi/Palladio)&nbsp;and extends these functionalities (e.g. in-text&nbsp;referencing, LOD-module) in one web-based GUI. As a&nbsp;result, nodegoat offers researchers an environment&nbsp;that seamlessly combines data management&nbsp;functionalities with the ability to analyse and visualise&nbsp;data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The explorative nature of nodegoat allows researchers to trailblaze through data; instead of&nbsp;working with static ‘pushes’ - or exports - of data, data&nbsp;is dynamically ‘pulled’ within its context each time a&nbsp;query is fired. The environment can be used in self-defined collaborative configurations with varying&nbsp;clearance levels for different groups of users.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a result of nodegoat's object-oriented set-up, everything is an object. In the case of a research&nbsp;project on correspondence networks, this means that&nbsp;a researcher would define three types of objects in&nbsp;nodegoat: 'letter', 'person', 'city'. Each object relates to&nbsp;an other object via relations (e.g. a letter relates to&nbsp;persons to identify the sender/receiver and this&nbsp;letters has been sent from/received in a city). In an&nbsp;extended research process, researchers could also&nbsp;define themselves as objects in the dataset, their&nbsp;sources or other datasets. Due to the focus on relations&nbsp;and associations between heterogeneous types of&nbsp;objects, the platform is equipped to perform analyses&nbsp;spanning multitudes of objects. By enriching objects&nbsp;with chronological and geospatial attributed&nbsp;associations, the establishment and the evolution of&nbsp;networks of objects is fully contextualised. In&nbsp;nodegoat, these contexts and sets of networked data&nbsp;can be instantly visualised through time and space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This open-ended approach makes nodegoat different from tools like the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Social Networks and&nbsp;Archival Context Project</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alan Liu’s Research Oriented&nbsp;Social Environment</span><span class="font2">, the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Software Environment for the&nbsp;Advancement of Scholarly Research</span><span class="font2">, </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Prosop</span><span class="font2">, or tools&nbsp;with a main focus on coding of qualitative data as seen&nbsp;in various computer-assisted qualitative data analysis&nbsp;software. With its object-oriented approach, nodegoat&nbsp;facilitates the aggregation of collections, coding of&nbsp;texts, and analysis of networks, but models these&nbsp;methods towards the creation and contextualisation of&nbsp;single objects that move through time and space.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Facts &amp; Figures</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">nodegoat is conceptualised and built by the independent research firm LAB1100, based in The&nbsp;Hague, The Netherlands. In order to share the&nbsp;functionalities of nodegoat with the scholarly&nbsp;community, scholars and research institutes are&nbsp;invited to use nodegoat for their own research&nbsp;purposes. Over 300 scholars have a personal research&nbsp;domain on nodegoat.net. Over 15 institutional&nbsp;partnerships have been established with universities,&nbsp;research institutes, and museums in The Netherlands,&nbsp;Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">nodegoat user forum and FAQ</span><span class="font2"> is hosted on the Historical Network Research website. In the course of&nbsp;2018 an open source package of nodegoat will be&nbsp;released within the wider framework of the nodegoat&nbsp;community.</span></p>
