<p><span class="font2">Games have been used to help people learn</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">throughout history (Vankus, 2005). Video games are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">interactive and encourage active learning</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Dominguez, Saenz-de-Navarrete, de-Marcos, Fernan-dez-Sanz, Pages, &amp; Martinez-Herraiz, 2013; Watson, Mong, &amp; Harris, 2011) more so than learning via lecture or textbook reading. The interactive nature of&nbsp;games also makes them engaging to the player. Student engagement is an essential component of learning (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris 2004; Hall, Ramsay, &amp; Raven, 2004; Kahu, 2013). Most scholars agree&nbsp;that games, when designed well, can increase student&nbsp;learning and retention (Ricci, Salas, &amp; Cannon-Bowers,&nbsp;2009) as well as motivation (Gee, 2003; Fullerton,&nbsp;2014; Eichenbaum, Bavelier, &amp; Green, 2014).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sykes and Reinhardt (2013) define game-based second language learning and teaching as the “use of games and game-inclusive synthetic immersive environments” (p. 5) that are designed specifically for second language learning contexts. They also state that&nbsp;few game-based spaces are available specifically for&nbsp;second language learning purposes. Scholars have&nbsp;noted the unintentional effect on second language&nbsp;learning that commercial games can have, for example,&nbsp;children in countries where English is not commonly&nbsp;spoken have been observed as acquiring knowledge of&nbsp;the language as a means to play the game (S0rensen &amp;&nbsp;Meyer, 2007). Other research has focused on second&nbsp;language-learning interactions that learners form in&nbsp;multi-player video environments, including those associated with video game chat rooms (Ryu, 2013). Although some video games that target language learning&nbsp;have emerged, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Croquelandia, Language Island,&nbsp;Mentira, MIDDWorld Online,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zon</span><span class="font2"> (Sykes &amp; Reinhardt, 2013), much research remains to be done in the&nbsp;efficacy of this game genre. The central question guiding our research is: How can a videogame best be designed to effectively enhance student second language&nbsp;acquisition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To answer this question, we turn to Ellis's (1985) recommendations to facilitate language learning: the&nbsp;quantity of input directed at the learner, the learner's&nbsp;perceived need to communicate in the second language, and the here-and-now principles. Current second language pedagogy also stresses that learning&nbsp;should be authentic and goal-oriented. Drawing on socio-cultural theory, researchers have linked second&nbsp;language acquisition with a “language game” (Lantolf,&nbsp;1997), explaining that play can allow learners to rehearse linguistic forms they already know and to experiment with new input in a low-pressure environment. The game we are developing will satisfy Ellis's&nbsp;requirements for the quantity of input, the necessity&nbsp;for competency in the language (to advance in the&nbsp;game), and the “here-and-now” principle, in addition&nbsp;to authenticity and goal-orientation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This session will explain and demonstrate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE the EndLess LEarner</span><span class="font2">, a game prototype designed to enable&nbsp;the study of secondary-language acquisition through&nbsp;an endless runner game platform. The system is designed so that different game features, specifically auditory, visual, and textual cues, can be modified easily&nbsp;by a researcher and the efficacy of each studied in relation to language acquisition and the game platform.&nbsp;The platform has been designed in this way to allow&nbsp;for research into the impact of these different cues and&nbsp;input methods on the activities being studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The style of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> is an “endless runner,” which means that the player's avatar is continuously in motion, “running” through the game environment. For example, the iOS game </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Temple Run 2</span><span class="font2">, continuously&nbsp;moves the player forward, without allowing the avatar&nbsp;to stop. The only controls available to the player are&nbsp;turning right or left, and jumping over or ducking under obstacles. The player cannot control the speed of&nbsp;motion though it can be manipulated through in-game&nbsp;objects. This game style results in a fast pace requiring&nbsp;players to react rapidly, and it has great potential to&nbsp;increase student motivation and engagement in the&nbsp;types of common sense practice exercises that help solidify vocabulary acquisition. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> is being designed in&nbsp;conjunction with modern language researchers and is&nbsp;grounded in the scholarship of language learning theories and evidence-based pedagogical methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We chose an endless runner style videogame to address a number of practical concerns, as scholars assert that the connection between game mechanics and intended argument must be intentional (Bogost,&nbsp;2007). First, this popular style of game is intuitive and&nbsp;easy to play. Next, we believe the endless runner style,&nbsp;being a casual game, will be less intimidating for learners who do not identify as “gamers.” The fast pace of&nbsp;this style requires rapid recall and provides immediate feedback in a low-consequence environment that&nbsp;lends itself to repeated play and therefore repeated reinforcement of the content. Endless runner games&nbsp;limit player choices within the game, which allow for&nbsp;an increased emphasis on the language terms being&nbsp;practiced. Finally, this prototype, initially focusing on&nbsp;vocabulary acquisition, lays the groundwork for future&nbsp;iterations of the game as an on-demand language practice tool that will have the ability for instructor modification of content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have chosen Portuguese as the initial language for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> to teach, as it is one of the most important&nbsp;world languages today. As the sixth most spoken language in the world, the Portuguese language is a gateway to the cultural and economic opportunities of Brazil and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world.&nbsp;From Portugal to the emerging economies of Africa,&nbsp;the Portuguese language has over 200 million native&nbsp;speakers, is an official language in nine countries, and&nbsp;is spoken on three continents. The US government&nbsp;considers Portuguese to be a language of “critical&nbsp;need,” especially because of the nation's trade relations with Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> is being designed as a game system that can continue to be studied and built upon over time. The&nbsp;team's initial goal is for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> to function as the center&nbsp;of a variety of studies to increase understanding of second language acquisition. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> is being designed using the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Unreal Engine</span><span class="font2"> and readily available tools and&nbsp;tutorials, to reduce costs and to allow for increased focus on the variety of cue types that are of interest to&nbsp;the research team. This game prototype style, with its&nbsp;manipulable components, will allow the team to quantify the effects of different game features and player&nbsp;actions. Additionally, the components can be used to&nbsp;increase accessibility and to adapt the game based on&nbsp;player needs. This empirical data can then be leveraged and further explored to increase the efficacy of&nbsp;language learning games.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our research will work to identify what motivates</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and engages SLA learners, relying on self-determination theory (Ryan, Rigby, &amp; Przybylski, 2006) to ensure an appropriate balance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational strategies. The design team's collaboration with modern language instructors has identified a&nbsp;lack of postsecondary level SLA supplemental tools&nbsp;that students find motivating; therefore, this prototype has the potential to inform improvements to future tools for second language instruction. This game&nbsp;is intended to act as a supplement to instruction and&nbsp;other classroom activities, rather than a replacement.&nbsp;Because student motivation is such a major factor in&nbsp;learning, the learning research undertaken as part of&nbsp;this project will also examine student engagement using the model of mastery and performance goal orientation (De Clercq, Galand, and Frenay, 2014). Mastery&nbsp;of second language concepts will motivate some students while others may focus on their performance&nbsp;against their peers. In addition to testing the game feature of textual, visual, and auditory cues, the team is&nbsp;also investigating the impact of game mechanics such&nbsp;as leader boards on student motivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The team's long-term goal is to create a robust database-driven game that can be easily customized to teach vocabulary words / phrases / pictograms from&nbsp;any semiotic domain, regardless of language or subject, particularly at the primary and secondary school&nbsp;levels. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ELLE</span><span class="font2"> will be leveraged to research socio-cognitive variables of domain language acquisition. Such socio-cognitive variables include questions about how&nbsp;the gaming environment influences learners' motivation and how the interaction within the multimodal&nbsp;space of a video game could be affected by different aspects of identity, for example, gender. Potential semiotic domains could even include STEM subjects such&nbsp;as chemistry and biology. In other words, the proposed project will allow the investigative team not&nbsp;only to develop an effective game through which to introduce a second or additional language but, ultimately, to allow the team to explore both cognitive and&nbsp;social aspects of language acquisition.</span></p>
