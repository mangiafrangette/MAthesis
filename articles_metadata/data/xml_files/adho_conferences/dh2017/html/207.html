<p><span class="font2">In her nuanced discussion of teenagers and their use of digital technology, danah boyd argues that there&nbsp;are far-reaching consequences for assuming that&nbsp;young students are naturally digitally savvy and older&nbsp;adults are digitally hampered; we assume younger&nbsp;students are digital natives adept at using and&nbsp;understanding technology, while adults are digital&nbsp;immigrants, still learning the language and culture of&nbsp;the digital world (2014: 176-193). In fact, “Familiarity&nbsp;with the latest gadgets or services is often less&nbsp;important than possessing the critical knowledge to&nbsp;engage productively with networked situations,&nbsp;including the ability to control how personal&nbsp;information flows and how to look for and interpret&nbsp;accessible information” (boyd, 2014: 180), and she&nbsp;further cautions that “access to technology should not&nbsp;be conflated with use” (boyd, 2014:192).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But access is not universal. Even among teenagers, there are different levels of participation because of&nbsp;the access to the technology, the quality of the access&nbsp;related to the socioeconomic status of the teenager&nbsp;and the consequent different levels of digital skills&nbsp;(See Hargittai, 2008). While young, wealthier students&nbsp;may have access without sufficient knowledge about&nbsp;the limitations and challenges of their digital access,&nbsp;students from lower socioeconomic groups may not&nbsp;even have access except through the technology&nbsp;provided by their schools, libraries and other local&nbsp;institutions. The economic divide contributes to the&nbsp;digital divide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This digital divide is further exacerbated by the institutional divisions and economic resources&nbsp;between two-year comprehensive community&nbsp;colleges and four-year institutions. Anne B. McGrail, a&nbsp;community college instructor herself, in her&nbsp;discussion of the role digital humanities might play in&nbsp;the community colleges, asks “What are community&nbsp;colleges and their students missing out on in their&nbsp;exclusion from DH discourse, and how might&nbsp;intentional engagement with DH methods and tools&nbsp;help community college students become active&nbsp;agents of discovery and change in their lives?”&nbsp;(McGrail, 2016). These questions are particularly&nbsp;pointed given that many of the students at the&nbsp;comprehensive community colleges intend to transfer&nbsp;to four-year institutions and see the two-year colleges&nbsp;as an affordable first entry into college. If digital&nbsp;humanities is “the next big thing” as William&nbsp;Pannapacker announced in his 2010 blog in The&nbsp;Chronicle of Higher Education, is digital access&nbsp;another inequity in the system of higher education?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But how are digital access and inequality linked? At traditional four-year institutions, instructors may find&nbsp;the digital divide initially a challenge because of the&nbsp;access that students have had prior to their&nbsp;matriculation, but once they are enrolled, the&nbsp;institution provides digital access and support for&nbsp;both students and instructors. The learning curve may&nbsp;be steep for some students, but there are footholds on&nbsp;the way up. At the community colleges, however,&nbsp;which typically enrolls a variety of diverse students, a&nbsp;range from nontraditional students, who may be&nbsp;returning students apprehensive about their abilities,&nbsp;who may be limited in time and financial resources,&nbsp;and who are less likely to have access to or to use&nbsp;digital technology, to the more traditional students&nbsp;who nevertheless do not have the economic resources&nbsp;to access the newest digital resources, the digital&nbsp;divide begins at enrollment and may continue after&nbsp;enrollment. Both groups may be under-prepared,&nbsp;under-resourced and have issues of persistence. Yet,&nbsp;contrary to the four-year institutional model, the&nbsp;divide is further complicated because community&nbsp;colleges and their instructors, many of whom are&nbsp;adjuncts with peripatetic careers, are also underresourced and lacking strong support for the digital&nbsp;humanities. The digital divide begins at enrollment&nbsp;and continues even after enrollment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This presentation directly addresses these issues of digital access and equity among community college&nbsp;students. In particular, I examine the implications of&nbsp;the digital divide among the community college&nbsp;population: the problems of access and use among&nbsp;community college students both before and after they&nbsp;enroll, the different levels and aspects of digital&nbsp;preparedness for students, instructors and&nbsp;administrators, and the institutional issues of support&nbsp;and resources to create robust digital humanities at&nbsp;the comprehensive community college. I discuss in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">detail academic planning and creation of institutional support including establishment of Makerspaces and&nbsp;digital labs, professional development opportunities&nbsp;for faculty, and the creation of assignments that&nbsp;address some of these issues.</span></p>
