<p><span class="font2">In 2010, 2.9 million Americans self-identified as American Indian or Alaska Native. In addition, another&nbsp;2.3 million people reported as American Indian or&nbsp;Alaska Native in combination with one or more other&nbsp;races. There are 562 federally-recognized tribes in the&nbsp;United States with dozens of other state-recognized&nbsp;tribes awaiting federal recognition. Outside of the U.S.&nbsp;there are millions of other indigenous community&nbsp;members in lands far-flung. Native American Studies&nbsp;(on Native American Studies and its relationship to&nbsp;knowledge, see Fixico, 2013; Madsen, 2012; Meyers,&nbsp;2016; and Warrior, 2014), an interdisciplinary field of&nbsp;study exploring the history, culture, politics, issues,&nbsp;and contemporary experience of these indigenous&nbsp;peoples of America, intersects with a number of issues&nbsp;related to access, preservation, and methodology that&nbsp;are problematized through the development and deployment of digital tools, methods and research. While&nbsp;tremendous work has been done around the preservation and access of analog materials within Native</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">American communities (for an example of digital Native American projects, see the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chaco Canyon Research Archive</span><span class="font2">), there has been much less attention paid to the ways in which digital objects (on analog to&nbsp;digital surrogates, see the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Protocols for Native American Archival Materials</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font2"> on digital repatriation, see&nbsp;Christen, 2011; Colwell-Chanthaphonh, 2011; Colwell,&nbsp;2015; and Runde, 2010), practices, and methods function within Native communities and through Native&nbsp;American Studies scholarship. With the exception of&nbsp;the Murkutu content management system which originated with the Warumungu Aboriginal community in&nbsp;the Central Australian town of Tennant Creek, digital</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">humanities researchers and developers have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">largely separate from Native American Studies- for example, it is only in the last year or so that we have begun to see digital humanities represented at Native American Studies conferences (e.g. Ethnohistory, Native American and Indigenous Studies Association,&nbsp;etc.) or within topical sub-panels at professional gatherings like the American Studies Association, the Modern Language Association, or the American Historical&nbsp;Association. There are hundreds of scholars actively&nbsp;working at dozens of American Indian, Native American, and Indigenous studies programs in addition to&nbsp;scholars working in humanities departments like literature, history, anthropology, archeology, etc. While&nbsp;museum, library, and archival communities have digitized Native cultural objects, literature, and music,&nbsp;there has been just cursory use of these materials&nbsp;within the larger digital humanities research landscape outside of digital archives or digital anthropol-ogy/archeology contexts. This submission opens by&nbsp;exploring a handful of individual projects that have&nbsp;leveraged Native materials to highlight how Native&nbsp;American studies scholars might critique the use and&nbsp;contextualization of tribal materials. Potential projects&nbsp;for exploration include </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Performing Archive: Edward&nbsp;Curtis + “the vanishing race”</span><span class="font2"> , the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Indigenous Digital&nbsp;Archive</span><span class="font2">, and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Native American Images Project</span><span class="font2">. The&nbsp;digital humanities community has done little to inform&nbsp;itself of the unique issues associated with research and&nbsp;teaching by and in the Native American context. This&nbsp;knowledge has not been integrated for five reasons: 1)&nbsp;funding for Native American studies research institutionally has focused on the production of traditional&nbsp;scholarly products (e.g. monographs); 2) Native American studies as a discipline has remained underfunded&nbsp;institutionally which bars many institutions from hiring staff, faculty, and tribal members to work together&nbsp;to teach and research; 3) funding for cultural heritage&nbsp;organizations including tribal archives, libraries, and&nbsp;museums, has focused on preservation and access to&nbsp;analog materials (on intellectual property issues associated with analog to digital Native materials, see Anderson, 2005; and Brown and Nicholas, 2012) only, rather than embracing the spectrum of digital and analog materials that document Native life; 4) the diversity of academic disciplines who participate in Native&nbsp;Studies is broad and, as such, lends itself to fragmentation and a lack of information exchange about digital&nbsp;projects, tools, methods, and pedagogy; and 5) Digital</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Native studies most frequently is only encountered by scholars and community members at the end of the development cycle as the project is released and they&nbsp;begin to encounter “actual” users. As a result, there do&nbsp;not exist any best practices, guidelines, or even suggestions about the process of working in digital environments with Native American communities. Archaeologists and museum professionals have made the furthest strides in attempting to address engagement&nbsp;with tribal communities and research (on issues of information architecture and archiving in indigenous&nbsp;contexts, see Powell and Aiken, 2010; Cushman, 2013;&nbsp;Senier, 2014; Christen, 2012; and Joffrion and Fernández, 2015), yet that work has not widely proliferated&nbsp;among the interdisciplinary humanities nor the digital&nbsp;humanities more generally. As a result, each digital humanist (and humanist) must start from scratch and negotiate every encounter without guidance or lessons&nbsp;learned from those who have attempted integration of&nbsp;the digital with Native American Studies before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, because these conversations have</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">been focused mainly on individual projects or on</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">knowledge management generally (e.g. the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Murkutu Project</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural&nbsp;Heritage Protocol</span><span class="font2">), the cross-pollination of an interdisciplinary community of digital researchers with&nbsp;tribal communities, cultural heritage organizations,&nbsp;and academic scholars has been significantly underdeveloped. Thus, it is not surprising that there are only a&nbsp;handful of funded digital projects documenting Native&nbsp;American life: the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">American Indian Treaties Portal</span><span class="font2">, a&nbsp;digital collection of the final texts of 366 of the 375&nbsp;American Indian treaties recognized by the United&nbsp;States Department of State, and the digitized </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Journals&nbsp;of Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition</span><span class="font2"> created in partnership&nbsp;with the Center for Digital Research at the University&nbsp;of Nebraska Lincoln. </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Mark of the Mississippians: A&nbsp;Multi-Platform Digital Media Project</span><span class="font2"> (Cahokia Mounds&nbsp;Museum Society) and </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Meeting the Earthworks Builders,</span><span class="font2"> a flashbased video game are currently being developed by the Ohio State University.. Additionally, NEH&nbsp;Public Programs just funded </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Indians of the Midwest</span><span class="font2">,&nbsp;an educational website focused on recent scholarship&nbsp;on Native peoples and the Newberry Library Collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The barriers to digital fluency in Native American studies are varied and include such obstacles as cultural rules regarding access to sensitive materials, the&nbsp;advanced technical expertise that software and hardware often requires beyond basic digitization, the&nbsp;costs of digital infrastructure and proprietary license&nbsp;fees, and issues of community engagement and trust&nbsp;that might limit the display of digital materials about&nbsp;Native peoples. It might be tempting to assume that&nbsp;the uptake of digital humanities method and pedagogy&nbsp;in the academic, cultural heritage, and tribal communities is one of lack of information or funding, but in&nbsp;fact the digital humanities researchers included as&nbsp;part of the Digital Native American and Indigenous&nbsp;Studies project are finding that it is also the cultural&nbsp;barriers to access, display, and analysis across differing types of digital materials that are challenging our&nbsp;ability to leverage digital tools, resources, and approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Digital Humanities articulates three parallel interdisciplinary commitments to “openness”: 1) a commitment to open access publishing; 2) a commitment to open access/open source software development; and&nbsp;3) a commitment to open access data. While the first&nbsp;two trends have received deep and lasting attention&nbsp;via scholarly publishing and digital commons enterprises and the open source development movement&nbsp;promoted by github and other code repositories, the&nbsp;commitment to open access data has been largely undertheorized. Using case studies of Digital Humanities&nbsp;projects that have been developed using Native American and Indigenous content, this submission suggests&nbsp;that Native and Indigenous content complicates the&nbsp;current technical application of open source development driven by digital aggregators and application&nbsp;programming interface development. By highlighting&nbsp;ethical issues around the use, reuse, and distributed&nbsp;architectures encouraged by common digital humanities technologies, this submission suggests that the&nbsp;rhetoric and practice of the open access data movement obscures both Native agency in determining the&nbsp;use of community materials as well as the role of technical determinism in proliferating the violence of colonial archives on Native communities. Questions this&nbsp;submission engages with include: How do we deal&nbsp;with born-digital research data in Native American&nbsp;and Indigenous contexts? How do we as scholars responsibly engage in digital research in Native communities? How do organizations and institutions navigate&nbsp;the cultural, legal, and ethical contexts of the communities whose objects they hold? How can free and open&nbsp;source software solutions be leveraged to build community engagement? Finally, what might be recommended for tribal communities who desire to launch&nbsp;their own digital projects but may have concerns&nbsp;about resources, access, infrastructure, and preservation?</span></p>
