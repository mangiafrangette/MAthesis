<p><span class="font4">Historical sources provide us only a fragmentary testimony of historical processes. The survival of specific sources and the information they contain is very&nbsp;often determined by chance. Because of these circumstances, the reconstruction of many historical&nbsp;processes remains problematic or, in some cases, almost impossible. In addition to these problems, some&nbsp;long-term historical processes are very difficult to&nbsp;recognize from the perspective of “event history” due</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to their gradual nature. The interdisciplinary project</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GEHIR (Generative Historiography of Religion) at Ma-saryk University strives to, within the framework of the historically oriented study of religions, adopt innovative methods used in the study of the dynamics&nbsp;of complex systems, i.e. methods including mathematical and geographical modelling, agent-based&nbsp;simulations or network analysis. Within the study of&nbsp;historical processes these formalized methods are&nbsp;conceptualized as an innovative third way through&nbsp;which the limitations of the traditional inductive&nbsp;analysis of historical sources and deductive application of social-scientific and cognitive theories to social and historical phenomena can be overcome. In&nbsp;this paper we would like to introduce the results&nbsp;from a case study within the GEHIR which focused on&nbsp;uncovering the possible factors influencing the early&nbsp;spread of the cults of Isis and Sarapis in the ancient&nbsp;Mediterranean.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Methods</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">In this project, traditional methods of historical research such as critical analysis of the archeological&nbsp;and literary sources or categorization of the historical&nbsp;evidence in the form of relational database were supplemented by the following computational methods:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Network analysis </span><span class="font4">is currently used in various areas of historical research, mainly to&nbsp;understand and analyse complex structures,&nbsp;e. g. trading cities in state, social groups.&nbsp;There are a number of historical research&nbsp;papers that have used network analysis; the&nbsp;work of Rivers et al (2012) should be mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Environmental/geographical modelling</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is used to reconstruct the potential of locality within an examined phenomenon that is even partially spatially-dependent. It offers&nbsp;a unique opportunity for researchers to understand how spatial conditions are related&nbsp;to other events. The work of Turchin et al&nbsp;(2013) and others could be used as an illustration of such methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mathematical statistical analysis </span><span class="font4">aims to find hidden logical patterns and existing&nbsp;correlations within multiple phenomena&nbsp;that may subsequently be interpreted in the&nbsp;context of the research questions. Various&nbsp;methods and approaches can be used, including clustering, multidimensional analyses, and exploratory data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Case study: Egyptian cults in the Aegean Sea region</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the Ptolemaic era, in the period between ca. 305 - 167 BCE, the Egyptian cults, particularly&nbsp;those of Isis and Sarapis, spread successfully to ports&nbsp;in the ancient Mediterranean. The reasons behind&nbsp;this process are, however, only partially understood.&nbsp;The original and still respected hypotheses in the academic discussion emphasize either the maritime&nbsp;trade (Fraser, 1960) or Ptolemaic political propaganda (Cumont, 1911:78-80) as key factors in the spread&nbsp;of these cults. Both of these claims are supported by&nbsp;historical evidence. Ptolemaic Egypt was one of the&nbsp;main exporters of grain, Isis was a patron goddess of&nbsp;sailors and many cities in the ancient Mediterranean&nbsp;had close diplomatic relations with the Ptolemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To specify our area of interest, this research is mainly focused on the early spread of the Egyptian cults in&nbsp;the area of the Aegean Sea, particularly the Aegean&nbsp;islands. There are several reasons for this selection:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">the main trading routes between Alexandria and continental Greece passed through that&nbsp;particular area with the Aegean islands as&nbsp;potential places of Egyptian interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">the first Ptolemies were politically invested in the Aegean using the islands as strategic&nbsp;locations for military bases and administered the Island league.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">islands are more isolated worlds and thus more suitable for modelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to clarify these hypotheses, we sequentially applied the described computational methods to the&nbsp;issues of maritime transport network reconstruction,&nbsp;approximation of the urgency of importing goods,&nbsp;evaluation of positional advantages of particular islands, and statistical correlation of different modelled&nbsp;factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first task was to reconstruct the maritime transport network, as this was the backbone of ancient Mediterranean trade. For this purpose, Pascal&nbsp;Arnaud's collection of ancient maritime routes were&nbsp;scanned and geo-referenced in GIS software and all&nbsp;the routes within the area of interest were redrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This network was then validated and modified by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">location</span><span class="font4"> of ancient ports, the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">AWMC map</span><span class="font4"> and geometries of islands. Afterwards, we were able to use network analysis to calculate centrality values in order to approximate attractiveness of harbours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As strategic positioning is not the only determinant of trade intensity, we also decided to estimate the ratio of agricultural potential and the number of&nbsp;inhabitants on each island. This can then be used as&nbsp;an approximation of the urgency of goods import.&nbsp;Food production was measured based on the geographical environmental model we created. Various&nbsp;approaches to population estimates were put forward and discussed. We decided to use historical&nbsp;censuses from the 19th century, as they were taken&nbsp;before the demographic transition in the area and the&nbsp;population values should more or less correlate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to validate the hypothesis emphasizing the Ptolemaic political actions as a key factor of the&nbsp;spread of the cults, we also needed to define the political factors. The Ptolemaic garrisons dispersed in the&nbsp;Aegean Sea are of great importance in our research&nbsp;because many of them were maintained for a long&nbsp;period of time and could thus increase the chance of&nbsp;spreading the cults via Ptolemaic soldiers. The second&nbsp;potential factor influencing the spread of the Egyptian cults is the existence of political leagues. In the&nbsp;context of the Aegean Sea, Ptolemies led the Island&nbsp;league from ca. 287 to 250s BCE. Again, this political&nbsp;factor is relevant because it is geographically delimited and lasted for a longer period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final and perhaps the most important dataset includes the locations of the Egyptian temples and&nbsp;artefacts from the above specified spatio-temporal&nbsp;frame (see Figure 1), collected from the RICIS catalogue (Bricault, 2005).</span></p><img src="050_files/050-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:182pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: Map of the Aegean Sea region and locations of relevant temples (blue dots) and artefacts (red dots) of&nbsp;Egyptian cults, as well as Ptolemaic military garrison placements (stars).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Geographical analysis was used to calculate distances from each island to the closest army base and temple&nbsp;in order to evaluate spatial dispositions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final part of the research is the statistical analysis of data obtained in previous steps. At that&nbsp;point we had a table containing the list of islands with&nbsp;their attributes based on the data (e.g. if an island&nbsp;occupied a strategic position on the network, or if it&nbsp;had a Ptolemaic garrison) and the goal was to find a&nbsp;solid and interpretable mathematical model that&nbsp;would be able to find and explain relations between&nbsp;these values, mainly their dependency on the distance to the closest temple on the network.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Results and Conclusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mathematical model we selected using the statistical analysis of covariance uncovered a few patterns within our datasets. The results suggest that&nbsp;there is a strong correlation between the placement&nbsp;of the Ptolemaic garrisons and the dissemination of&nbsp;Egyptian temples and artefacts in the Aegean sea. The&nbsp;interpretation would, in this case, be that the Egyptian military forces potentially played a significant&nbsp;role in the spread of the cults. However, the analysis&nbsp;also showed that in areas far from these military ba-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ses the islands with higher trade attractiveness intensified the presence of the Egyptian cults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main task of this paper is to show how we can</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“regrow” the Egyptian cults in space and time using innovative computational methods from multiple disciplines. This allows us to validate the selected hypotheses from the academic discussion constructed&nbsp;by using traditional historiographical methods. We&nbsp;see great potential for using these approaches in the&nbsp;other case studies of GEHIR, as well as in historiography in general.</span></p>
