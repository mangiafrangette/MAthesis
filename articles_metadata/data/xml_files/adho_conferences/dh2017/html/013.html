<p><span class="font2">Tropy is a freely licensed and open-source software tool currently under development by the Roy&nbsp;Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media that&nbsp;will allow researchers to collect and organize the&nbsp;digital photographs they take in their research,&nbsp;associate metadata with those images, and export both&nbsp;photographs and metadata to other platforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tropy is filling a critical need in the workflow of researchers who visit archives. This need for photo&nbsp;management has largely arisen since the widespread&nbsp;adoption of photographing sources in the archives&nbsp;instead of reading and analyzing them on-site.&nbsp;Postponing analysis to a later moment in the research&nbsp;cycle proves more difficult than most scholars&nbsp;anticipate: according to the ITHAKA S+R report&nbsp;“Supporting the Changing Research Practices of&nbsp;Historians” (2012), researchers now typically&nbsp;photograph everything they can, and then, faced with&nbsp;“the lack of tools or software to facilitate the process&nbsp;of capturing and using digital photographs for&nbsp;scholars,” struggle to “organize and access&nbsp;photographs in a constructive way after a trip.”&nbsp;Researchers typically depart from the archives with&nbsp;photographs that might include limited EXIF metadata&nbsp;about the image but never contain any metadata&nbsp;describing the imaged artifact itself. At present it is&nbsp;difficult if not impossible for researchers to attach&nbsp;such metadata to images, particularly regarding their&nbsp;provenance, and to organize them so that scholars can&nbsp;identify and find what is important to their research&nbsp;projects.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">With Tropy, you will be able to:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Import. </span><span class="font2">You will be able to drag and drop one or more JPG images into Tropy. Importing will add the&nbsp;image files to Tropy’s internal data store, generate&nbsp;thumbnails for each of the new images, and add&nbsp;preliminary metadata based on a template.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Edit. </span><span class="font2">Tropy provides the core functions needed to ensure that images are adequate for your purposes; it&nbsp;is not intended to be a full-featured image editing&nbsp;software. You will be able to rotate, crop, zoom, and&nbsp;adjust contrast. Each image’s metadata will also be&nbsp;individually editable. Available fields will be supplied&nbsp;by customizable templates: Tropy will include&nbsp;generalized archive templates, based on Dublin Core&nbsp;and EADS; and researchers and archivists will be able&nbsp;to create their own templates, customized to reflect&nbsp;specific collections and archives. A batch-editing mode&nbsp;will allow users to manipulate metadata across&nbsp;multiple images. Tropy will also include an interface&nbsp;for note-taking and transcription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Organize. </span><span class="font2">Images will be organized via collections and/or tags, with items able to appear in multiple&nbsp;collections and under multiple tags. You will have&nbsp;many ways of finding your archival images: browsing&nbsp;image collections and tags via list and thumbnail&nbsp;modes; sorting these views using all available&nbsp;metadata, such as date, source archive, and title; and&nbsp;searching across all available metadata, including&nbsp;notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Share. </span><span class="font2">All items stored in Tropy will be available for export both locally and to external, web-based&nbsp;services. Exporting a selection of items or a collection&nbsp;from Tropy will generate an archive file that includes&nbsp;image files along with their metadata in machine-readable format. You will also be able to transmit your&nbsp;images and metadata to external services via Tropy&nbsp;plugins. We will create at least three plugins spanning&nbsp;a range of services - Flickr, Omeka and an open-source&nbsp;digital asset management software (DAMS) - as well&nbsp;as documentation that allows users to develop their&nbsp;own plugins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We anticipate a beta release of Tropy in April 2017, and a 1.0 release in September 2017.</span></p>
