<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presentation Topic and State Of The Art</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On our poster we want to present ongoing work to create an automatic natural language processing tool&nbsp;for Hittite cuneiform. Hittite cuneiform texts are to&nbsp;this day manually transcribed by the respective experts and then published in a transliteration format&nbsp;(commonly ATF). Pictures of the original cuneiform&nbsp;tablet may be provided and more rarely cuneiform&nbsp;representations in Unicode are present. Due to recent&nbsp;advancements in the field (such as </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Cuneify</span><span class="font2">) an automatic translation of many Hittite cuneiform transliterations to their respective cuneiform representation&nbsp;is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Research Contributions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We build upon this work by creating tools that aim to automatically translate Hittite cuneiform texts to&nbsp;English from either a Unicode cuneiform representation or their transliteration representation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">POSTagger</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have created a morphological analyzer to detect nouns, verbs, several kinds of pronouns, their respective declinations and appendices as well as&nbsp;structural particles. On a sample set of annotated Hittite texts from different epochs in cuneiform and&nbsp;transliteration representation we have evaluated the&nbsp;morphological analyzer, its advantages, problems and&nbsp;possible solutions and intend to present the results as&nbsp;well as some POSTagging examples in section one of&nbsp;our poster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dictionary Creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dictionaries for Hittite cuneiform exist in often non-machine readable formats and without a connection to Semantic Web concepts. We intend to change&nbsp;this situation by parsing digitally available nonsemantic dictionaries and using matching algorithms to&nbsp;find concepts of the English translations of such dictionaries in the Semantic Web e.g. DBPedia or Wikidata. Dictionaries of this kind are stored using the Lexical Model for Ontologies (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lemon</span><span class="font2">). In addition to&nbsp;freely available dictionaries we intend to use </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">expert&nbsp;resources</span><span class="font2"> developed by the academy of sciences in&nbsp;Mainz/Germany to verify and extend our generated&nbsp;dictionaries. We intend to present the dictionary creation process, statistics about the content of generated&nbsp;dictionaries and their impact in section two of our&nbsp;poster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Machine Translation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Using the newly created dictionaries as well as the POSTagging information we intend to test several automated machine translation approaches of which we&nbsp;will outline the process and possible approaches in&nbsp;poster section three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Contributions for the Communities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With our approaches we intend to contribute to the archaeological community in Germany by analysing Hittite cuneiform tablets. Together with work&nbsp;from the University of Heidelberg on </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">image recognition of cuneiform tablets,</span><span class="font2"> we want to focus on creating a natural language processing pipeline from scanning cuneiform tablets to an available translation in&nbsp;English.</span></p>
