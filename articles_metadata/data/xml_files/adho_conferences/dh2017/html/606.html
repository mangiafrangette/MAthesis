<p><span class="font5">The HathiTrust Digital Library</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) comprises digitized representations of 15.1 million volumes: approximately 7.47 million book titles, 418,216 serial titles, and 5.3 billion pages, across 460 languages. HTDL&nbsp;is best described as “a partnership of major research&nbsp;institutions and libraries working to ensure that the&nbsp;cultural record is preserved and accessible long into&nbsp;the future”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) develops software models, tools, and infrastructure to help digital humanities (DH) scholars conduct new computational analyses of works in the HTDL. For many scholars the size of the HTDL corpus is both attractive and&nbsp;daunting: many existing DH tools are designed for&nbsp;smaller collections, and many research inquiries are&nbsp;facilitated by more focused, homogeneous collections&nbsp;of texts (Gibbs and Owens, 2012).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Worksets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In many, if not most, DH research endeavours, performing an analytical task across the whole HTDL is neither practical nor productive (Kambatla et al.,&nbsp;2014). For example, a tool trained to identify genre attributes of 18th century English language prose fiction&nbsp;may not be applicable to 20th century French poetry.&nbsp;The first step is to identify the subset -- of works, editions, volumes, chapters, pages -- to set an initial investigative scope and, indeed, subsequent iterative refinements of a subset as research proceeds. In a corpus as&nbsp;large and complex as the HTDL, finding materials and&nbsp;then defining the sought after subset can be extraordinarily difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">HTRC has come to call collections of digital items brought together by a scholar for her analyses a&nbsp;“workset”, created to help the researcher build, manipulate, iteratively define and compare their collections. Reflecting upon input and advice from the DH&nbsp;community, Jett (2015) defines a workset as a machine-actionable research collection realised as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aggregation of members (volumes, pages,&nbsp;etc.);</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metadata intrinsic to the workset's essential&nbsp;nature (e.g., creator, selection criteria);</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metadata intrinsic to digital architectures&nbsp;(i.e. creation date &amp; number of members);</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metadata supportive of human interactions&nbsp;(i.e. title &amp; description);</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative metadata from workset members&nbsp;(e.g. format(s), language(s), etc.); and,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metadata concerning workset provenance&nbsp;(e.g. derived from, used by, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Broadly, item 1 identifies the actual data used in an analysis; whereas the remaining metadata items describe the workset itself, aiding workset management&nbsp;throughout the research cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Cross-corpus worksets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As alluded above, numerous criteria can be used to select the constituents of a workset; and several technological implementations could, in theory, realise&nbsp;worksets. In researching the design and realisation of&nbsp;worksets and associated tooling, we are also mindful&nbsp;to remain grounded in their practical application and&nbsp;the needs of scholarly users. We have therefore undertaken our work through discipline-based scenarios in&nbsp;which we can explore the strengths and weaknesses of&nbsp;the HTDL viewed through the prism of worksets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We report one such exploration here, questioning </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">whether (relatively) small, well explored, and well understood corpora can be superimposed over the HTDL&nbsp;to aid navigation and investigation of the much larger&nbsp;and superficially understood HTDL collection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From a system perspective, a cross-corpus workset requires exposing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">compatible</span><span class="font4"> metadata (items 2-6&nbsp;above) from multiple collections, first used to align&nbsp;common elements, and then to assemble worksets. We&nbsp;take a Linked Data approach and achieve compatibility&nbsp;through ontologies, which might initially be bibliographic (and derived from library records) but should&nbsp;be iteratively extensible into the domain of the subject&nbsp;of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Examples in early English print</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early English Books Online Text Creation Partnership (EEBO-TCP) is a partnership with ProQuest and over 150 libraries and universities, led by Michigan&nbsp;and Oxford, to generate highly accurate, fully-searcha-ble texts tracing the history of English thought and&nbsp;learning from the first book printed in English in 1473&nbsp;through to 1700. Between 2000-2009 EEBO-TCP&nbsp;Phase I converted 25,000 selected texts from the EEBO&nbsp;corpus into TEI-compliant, XML-encoded hand-transcribed texts, subsequently freely released in January&nbsp;2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the work reported here, we have conjoined EEBO-TCP with a HathiTrust subset consisting of all&nbsp;materials described in their metadata as being in English and published between 1470 and 1700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To ensure a prototype which simultaneously explored the fit of scholars' needs to the technology and exercised the technical challenges outlined in the previous section, we undertook a ‘complete circuit'&nbsp;through the datasets (Figure 1). We: (i) ran a consultative workshop to choose investigations which might&nbsp;form the basis of worksets; (ii) used these abstract&nbsp;worksets to identify concrete requirements for the&nbsp;conjoined metadata; (iii) generated metadata from&nbsp;both corpora according to these specifications; (iv)&nbsp;aligned elements from both datasets in an overlapping</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">superset; (v) realised the worksets identified in (i) using this metadata.</span></p><img src="606_files/606-1.jpg" style="width:166pt;height:122pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. Overview of the metadata circuit leading to our cross-corpora workset</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Motivating worksets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the workshop we identified the following workset selections; we describe their implementation&nbsp;in subsequent sections:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">Find all the works, appearing in both datasets, written by Richard Baxter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">Find works in both datasets published in Oxford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">Find works published outside of London (where the bulk were published).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">Find works from both datasets published outside of London in the mid-to late 1600s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">Find all works in the two datasets for authors who have at least once published on the subject of “Political science”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font4">Find all works in these two datasets for authors who have at least once published works which are categorised as “biography”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding the penultimate workset, it is of particular note that this returns results across both datasets,&nbsp;since our EEBO-TCP import did not contain genre or&nbsp;topic information; this association must be entirely inferred from the semantic links via the technology described below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Implementation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Metadata requirements and ontology selection</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Building on Nurmikko-Fuller et al. (2015) and Jett et al. (2016) we surveyed the addressable resources&nbsp;and the schema expressivity of ontologies that could&nbsp;parameterise these classes of workset. We identified</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">parsable information structures in the EEBO-TCP TEI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">data, appropriate to the test worksets, and selected ontology terms to encode this EEBO-TCP metadata,&nbsp;ensuring compatibility (or at least, for our purposes,&nbsp;comparison) with RDF from the HathiTrust. The resultant </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ontology collection</span><span class="font4"> - the EEBO Ontology, or EEBOO - includes selections from MODS, Bibframe, and&nbsp;PROV, along with custom elements encoding additional structures (e.g. dates).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Creating EEBOO RDF and alignment with HTDL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Python scripts manipulated TEI P5 XML, then the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Karma Data Integration Tool</span><span class="font4"> mapped EEBO-TCP data&nbsp;structures into the EEBOO ontology. Particular attention was paid to dates encoded within strings, an example of rich semi-structured data that can be extracted into structured RDF. Links to author records in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">VIAF and the Library of Congress (LoC), and multimedia pages in the HTDL and ‘JISC Digital Books' website, were generated and added. Finally, author names&nbsp;were aligned between the EEBOO and HTDL triples using a reconfiguration of the SALT tool (Weigl et al.&nbsp;2016).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">24,926 EEBO-TCP Phase 1 records were processed, with 22 distinct types of information in the headers,&nbsp;including 6 different ID types and 3 types of date (publication date of historical work, author associated historical date(s), XML publication/editing dates). EEBOO incorporates 7 of these datatypes, and extends&nbsp;into subcategories for author names and date types.&nbsp;EEBOO contains 713 unique places, 6,489 unique expressions of Person of which 3,588 have VIAF and LoC&nbsp;IDs.</span></p><img src="606_files/606-2.jpg" style="width:219pt;height:128pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2. Architecture providing cross-corpus worksets for early English print</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Workset construction and viewing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtuoso</span><span class="font4"> triplestore (see also, the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtuoso Github repository</span><span class="font4">) stores the RDF data (totalling&nbsp;1,137,502 triples) and provides a SPARQL query interface. Figure 2 shows the overall system architecture.&nbsp;The workset constructor user interface (Figure 3) allows the user to select parameters in a web interface&nbsp;which are, in the background, assembled into SPARQL&nbsp;queries used to create a workset. The interface automatically populates valid attributes that are themselves retrieved from the triplestore, using ontological&nbsp;terms having equivalent meaning across datasets. In&nbsp;combination, the generated triples and SPARQL queries are fully sufficient for expressing the motivating&nbsp;workset definitions described earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The workset viewer (also Figure 3) then retrieves RDF workset contents, record metadata, data links,&nbsp;and multimedia links (to the Historic Books collection&nbsp;or the HTDL). Both web applications are written in Python, using the Flask framework, and both rely on the&nbsp;semantic information encoded in RDF and queried using SPARQL.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We have demonstrated the general feasibility of cross-corpus worksets in bringing together HathiTrust content with specialised collections through a&nbsp;specific implementation for early English printed&nbsp;books linking the HathiTrust to EEBO-TCP. Using&nbsp;Linked Data, we see that metadata can be extended in&nbsp;a piecemeal or iterative fashion, potentially moving&nbsp;beyond traditional bibliographic metadata to include&nbsp;semantic structures emerging from scholarly investigation of the worksets themselves; and in doing so&nbsp;support academic motivations and requirements for&nbsp;workset creation.</span></p>
