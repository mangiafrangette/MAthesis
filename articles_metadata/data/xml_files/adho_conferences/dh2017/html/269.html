<p><span class="font2">Research in the humanities has embraced the data-driven environment where advanced digital technologies have created the possibility of novel and&nbsp;hybrid methodologies. While the world is amazed by&nbsp;the many “V”s of Big Data (volume, velocity, variety,&nbsp;variability, veracity), the “V”alue of such data relies on&nbsp;the ability to achieve big insights from such data at any&nbsp;scale, great or small (Kobielus 2016). Smart Data can&nbsp;be considered trusted, contextual, relevant, cognitive,&nbsp;predictive, and consumable. In humanities research,&nbsp;Smart Data emphasizes the organizing and integrating&nbsp;processes from unstructured data to structured and&nbsp;semi-structured data, to make the big data smarter&nbsp;(Kobielus 2016, Schoch 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this panel, the interdisciplinary research teams from two universities will share their research&nbsp;findings and products as well as their experiences of&nbsp;using smart data approaches. As is the case with many&nbsp;other projects, the teams have to face the inherent&nbsp;challenges of converting heritage materials that were&nbsp;not machine-processable into digital datasets.&nbsp;Furthermore, the teams (again, like many others) have&nbsp;used common applications of available digital&nbsp;technologies and tools, such as GIS mapping, text&nbsp;encoding, fact mining, database construction, and&nbsp;visualization. In addition, the projects have employed&nbsp;sophisticated computer logics, the Linked Data&nbsp;models, network theory, and temporal-spatial data&nbsp;analytics, among others. However, the unique value of&nbsp;these projects lies in the exploration of independent&nbsp;datasets across disciplines, media, and perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of such datasets were built from unstructured data and media, while some other datasets have been&nbsp;existed isolated because the values are hidden in the&nbsp;silos. By drawing on many types of data&nbsp;simultaneously and interactively in an unprecedented&nbsp;manner, the research findings and established&nbsp;resources help reveal the unknown-unknowns and&nbsp;interpret significant values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To begin the panel, Dr. Marcia Zeng (Professor of information science) and Dr. Hongshan Li (Professor&nbsp;of history) will report on the project “Digital&nbsp;Humanities Research with Smart Big Data — A&nbsp;Network Framework of Innovation History” using the&nbsp;case of the Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State&nbsp;University (KSU), the birthplace of liquid crystal&nbsp;displays. Through the work of its faculty and alumni,&nbsp;LCI has had a significant impact on the way the world&nbsp;sees things -on our smartphones, tablets, and&nbsp;computer screens (Bos, 2015). By nature, innovations&nbsp;and inventions demand collaboration across various&nbsp;kinds of networks. More and more collaborative&nbsp;efforts, instead of individual hero-inventors, resulted&nbsp;in the innovations in the last two centuries and, even&nbsp;more apparently, today. This project has focused on a&nbsp;community of scientists in one large institution&nbsp;instead of individual scientists. The project intended&nbsp;to use comprehensive data from cross disciplines and&nbsp;perspectives to discover meaningful patterns in the&nbsp;history of innovation. The presentation will discuss&nbsp;various research methodologies applied to different&nbsp;types of data used by a research team consisting of&nbsp;more than 10 faculty members and research assistants&nbsp;from the disciplines of information science, history,&nbsp;geography, physics, visual communication design, and&nbsp;mass communication. The presenters will share the&nbsp;integrated research findings regarding the&nbsp;sophisticated relationships and networks of&nbsp;contributed factors and impacts over LCI’s 50-year&nbsp;history that complement traditional study of the&nbsp;history of science and technology. The presentation&nbsp;also aims to share our lessons and roadmaps of taking&nbsp;smart data approaches with the intention of helping&nbsp;more researchers to overcome the challenges in&nbsp;researching the innovation history in the digital age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second presentation will be given by Dr. James Lee and Arlene Johnson, co-directors of the Digital&nbsp;Scholarship Center at the University of Cincinnati&nbsp;(UC), along with members of their team. They will&nbsp;describe the team’s research entitled “Linked&nbsp;Reading,” which uses sophisticated machine logics to&nbsp;allow researchers to directly query, analyze, and&nbsp;visualize or sonify data from multiple independent</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">datasets, including the University of Cincinnati’s Elliston Poetry Archive. Since 2010, UC Libraries and&nbsp;the Department of English &amp; Comparative Literature&nbsp;have collaborated on The Elliston Project, an audio&nbsp;archive of over 700 recordings of poetry or poetry-related content. The recordings span seven decades&nbsp;and include over 450 poets, including Wendell Berry,&nbsp;Robert Frost, Allen Ginsberg, Louise Glück and a host&nbsp;of others. Alan Liu, a pioneer of digital humanities in&nbsp;literary studies, considers the Elliston project to be a&nbsp;“world-class poetry audio archive,” which has the&nbsp;potential to “alter the dominant understandings of a&nbsp;‘digital archive’ developed for textual materials.”&nbsp;Linked Reading allows one to examine scholarly&nbsp;questions on the question of poetry from multiple&nbsp;angles at once by pivoting laterally between multiple&nbsp;audio and text datasets. A unique opportunity for&nbsp;researchers and educators lies in constellations of&nbsp;micro and nano datasets that have been inadequately&nbsp;studied or even ignored. This approach, gathering&nbsp;smaller datasets of creative materials into a linked&nbsp;network, allows the team to leverage the local&nbsp;strengths in the humanities and creative arts&nbsp;(represented in stellar fashion by Elliston) to facilitate&nbsp;heretofore impossible research projects. Consider, for&nbsp;instance, poetic tone. It’s a basic tenet of poetry&nbsp;instruction that the poem on the page is but a score to&nbsp;be performed; and yet, poetry scholarship is in&nbsp;virtually every instance a study of the printed poem.&nbsp;The project illustrates a potential of reshaping this&nbsp;well-studied topic by ‘reading’ the sonic features of&nbsp;poetic tone in massive numbers of poetry recordings&nbsp;across many linked smaller archives. As such, the aims&nbsp;of this research are: 1, to transform the techniques of&nbsp;linked data into an analytical and interpretive method,&nbsp;and 2, to adapt well-establish machine learning&nbsp;techniques honed on text datasets for the analysis of&nbsp;large archives of born-audio creative works.</span></p>
