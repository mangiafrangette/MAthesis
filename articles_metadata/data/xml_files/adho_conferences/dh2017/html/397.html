<p><span class="font1">Points, lines, polygons, and pixels, the primary elements of digital visualization, can be arranged and&nbsp;rearranged to present infinite interpretations of space,&nbsp;time, objects, or patterns. Visualization offers a&nbsp;significant opportunity for humanities students to&nbsp;develop digital visual literacies through exploratory&nbsp;making, analysis, and storytelling. Yet incorporating&nbsp;digital visualization components into teaching&nbsp;depends upon instructors’ course content and access&nbsp;to expertise, time, and tools. A scalable, replicable&nbsp;approach is needed to support visualization&nbsp;pedagogies that can be implemented in diverse&nbsp;educational environments. In this poster, I propose a&nbsp;framework for designing and implementing&nbsp;visualization projects within existing courses, drawing&nbsp;on my instructional experience in the Wired! Lab at&nbsp;Duke University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rising prevalence of visual media in global society points to an increasing need to cultivate digital&nbsp;visual literacies in humanities classrooms. Susan&nbsp;Brown has noted this “shift from textuality to&nbsp;visuality,” calling for more “active engagement with&nbsp;new technologies rather than passive consumption.”&nbsp;Through this engagement, students may learn to&nbsp;create scholarly visualizations and can become&nbsp;thoughtful critics of the visual media with which they&nbsp;interact in everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My role with the Wired! Lab involves working with instructors to design and implement such&nbsp;visualization projects. These projects have involved a&nbsp;variety of methods, including architectural modeling,&nbsp;mapping, digital exhibit curation, and information&nbsp;visualization. (see the </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">list of recent student projects</span><span class="font1">)&nbsp;Through these collaborations, our instructional teams&nbsp;have recognized a need for both scalability and&nbsp;replicability in assignment design and&nbsp;implementation. Accordingly, I have begun to&nbsp;approach to project design with an eye toward&nbsp;creating instructional templates that can be applied to&nbsp;multiple topics and course levels. This strategy has&nbsp;been echoed by Aaron Mauro, who calls for an&nbsp;emphasis in undergraduate digital humanities on&nbsp;“iterability, openness, and extensibility” (Mauro,&nbsp;2016). Assignments must be made flexible, or&nbsp;responsive, to varying constraints in instructors’ and&nbsp;students’ access to resources both in and beyond the&nbsp;Wired! Lab. In response to this need for project plans&nbsp;that can be adjusted to a variety of contexts, I am&nbsp;developing a framework for iterative course project&nbsp;design.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Framework</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">This proposed framework presents a decisionmaking process that enables instructors to shape project ideas into assignments suitable for their&nbsp;multiple contexts. The framework seeks to match&nbsp;digital methods and resources with pedagogical goals,&nbsp;course content, and visualization concepts by guiding&nbsp;instructors through an iterative planning process:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Instructors are first asked to devise a research question, based on their course goals and content, that&nbsp;will drive the assignment. Next they develop a list of&nbsp;possible source materials and ascertain whether these&nbsp;materials are accessible to students. If materials are&nbsp;not available, instructors revise their question around&nbsp;available sources. These sources are then examined&nbsp;with the aim of identifying types of information: is it&nbsp;quantitative, qualitative, or both? How might this&nbsp;information be further classified—spatially,&nbsp;temporally, statistically, categorically? Of these data&nbsp;types, which provide evidence needed to answer the&nbsp;research question? (If this process reveals that the&nbsp;data are not useful, instructors should return to their&nbsp;question and list of sources to reevaluate.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Based on the process so far, instructors consider first how the visualization will be used: will it be a tool&nbsp;for exploring information and analysis? Or will its&nbsp;present an interpretive visual narrative? Second, will&nbsp;the visualization(s) be static or dynamic? Third,&nbsp;instructors consider which visualization type(s) might&nbsp;provide the best mode(s) of representation: scientific,&nbsp;informational, conceptual, spatial, temporal? Within&nbsp;these types, instructors begin to identify specific&nbsp;methods: mapping or 3D modeling, data visualization</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">or visual narrative, for example. Then another moment of reflection: does the chosen method fit the&nbsp;research question, course goals, and visualization&nbsp;purpose? If not, instructors may reconsider their&nbsp;method in conjunction with these decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, instructors begin exploring possible tools as they examine their design thus far in comparison to&nbsp;both students’ expected skill level and institutional&nbsp;resources: access to expertise (theirs or someone&nbsp;else’s), additional time before and during the course,&nbsp;and tools (hardware, software, internet).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Resulting visualization projects may require few or many interventions in the course structure and&nbsp;content. They may rely on a combination of&nbsp;visualization techniques. They may be applied in&nbsp;multiple course iterations. Overall, they should engage&nbsp;the research question while advancing digital visual&nbsp;literacies.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Visualization is a powerful tool for communication that can be investigated across humanities disciplines.&nbsp;It can be employed to develop students’ critical&nbsp;abilities to represent humanities research in a&nbsp;multitude of ways. This proposed framework&nbsp;addresses the challenges instructors face when&nbsp;implementing visualization in classrooms: from&nbsp;matching content to method, to identifying&nbsp;appropriate tools, to designing for scalability across&nbsp;one or more course settings.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
