<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paper examines the opportunities, approaches and issues of automatically classifying historical newspaper articles from the Netherlands for ‘genre' as an&nbsp;expression of the historically and culturally determined conception of journalism. Genre is defined as&nbsp;“language use in a conventionalized communicative&nbsp;setting in order to give expression to a specific set of&nbsp;communicative goals of a disciplinary or social institution, which give rise to stable structural forms” (Handford 2010). As Barnhurst and Nerone (2001) argue:&nbsp;“The form includes the way the medium imagines itself to be and to act. In its physical arrangement, structure, and format, a newspaper reiterates an ideal for&nbsp;itself.” Examining the generic form of newspaper articles form a historical perspective therefore sheds an&nbsp;interesting light on the way newspaper journalism has&nbsp;developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The digital era, which is typified as the ‘age of abundance' of historical newspaper material, poses new challenges to historical research. Historical approaches to selecting and analyzing newspapers,&nbsp;rooted in the assumption of a scarcity of available material, had to be replaced with social scientific methods, such as quantitative content analysis (Nicholson&nbsp;2013; Broersma 2009). Yet, manual quantitative content analyses are still highly time consuming and&nbsp;therefore expensive. Moreover, even then the size of&nbsp;the material that can be covered represents only a&nbsp;small part of the amount of material available (Harbers 2014). Automated forms of (content) analysis&nbsp;have the potential to alleviate or even solve this issue.&nbsp;As such, automatic forms of content analysis would be&nbsp;highly suitable for longitudinal and also comparative&nbsp;historical research into the development of newspapers, which particularly grapples with the overabundance of available research material (Broersma 2009).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, although these approaches have a great appeal to researchers (Allen, Waldstein &amp; Zhu 2008;&nbsp;Grimmer &amp; Stewart 2013), research in this vein is&nbsp;mostly done in information science and linguistics. It&nbsp;seldom has a press historical perspective (Broersma&nbsp;2009). Moreover, the emphasis has mostly been on&nbsp;topical modeling (Lee &amp; Myaeng 2002), whereas attention for automatic classification of style and genre is&nbsp;scarce. Rather than determining what subjects and&nbsp;themes are being discussed, this project aims to examine genre as a modes of expression of newspapers,&nbsp;shedding light on the discursive context (Handford&nbsp;2010). This is a particularly difficult task as genres are&nbsp;dynamic and can change or fade away over time while&nbsp;new ones can emerge. Moreover, genres are ideal-typical discursive constructs, which means the textual&nbsp;manifestations do not always match the characteristics of these constructs perfectly, nor can they always</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">be clearly delineated from other genres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The research question therefore is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To what extent and how can historical newspaper articles be automatically classified for genre?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To examine this question, we have designed a research project that builds on an existing set of metadata describing several textual characteristics,&nbsp;such as genre, of a large sample of historical newspaper articles. This dataset was the result of a large-scale&nbsp;research project into the historical development of European newspapers with the title ‘Reporting at the&nbsp;boundaries of the public sphere. Form, Style and Strategy of European Journalism, 1880-2005'. The set of&nbsp;metadata is derived from a manual content analysis&nbsp;that coded for genre based on a detailed rule-based&nbsp;coding manual. The metadata set relates to a corpus of&nbsp;approximately 33.000 Dutch newspaper articles from&nbsp;three types of Dutch newspapers, divided over the&nbsp;sample years 1885, 1905, 1925, 1965, 1985 and 2005&nbsp;(Harbers, 2014). This set of metadata thus provides us&nbsp;with a number of labeled example articles that can be&nbsp;used to train and formally evaluate a classifier that is&nbsp;able to automatically predict the genre of additional&nbsp;samples of historical newspaper articles. In order to so&nbsp;the metadata </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">first </span><span class="font2">has to be connected to the full text&nbsp;of the corresponding digitized articles in the Dutch&nbsp;newspaper repository of the National Library (KB).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">second </span><span class="font2">step is to use this enriched dataset to train a classifier that can classify historical newspaper articles automatically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paper first shows a way to connect the metadata to the digitized historical newspaper articles&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phase 1</span><span class="font2">). Ultimately, it offers an outline of a concrete&nbsp;machine learning approach, applying linear and nonlinear classifiers, to predict the genre of a newspaper&nbsp;article. As a part of this, the paper discusses the different tools we have tried out and the problems we have&nbsp;encountered in the process (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phase 2</span><span class="font2">). Specifically, the&nbsp;paper reflects on the way the rule-based approach to&nbsp;determining genre in the manual content analysis relates to the training of an automatic classifier based on&nbsp;machine learning techniques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to link the articles described in the existing metadata set to the corresponding KB data, we first&nbsp;created a number of rules to find the most promising&nbsp;candidate links for each item in the original data set,&nbsp;based on the position of the article on the page, its size,&nbsp;and the presence of images and quotes. Since these&nbsp;rule alone turned out not to be sufficiently accurate, a&nbsp;simple classifier was trained to select the best link&nbsp;from the candidate set, if any, based on features such&nbsp;as the difference in size and number of images present&nbsp;between the article as described in the original data&nbsp;set and the article as found in the KB repository, as&nbsp;well as author mentions and subject matter, amongst&nbsp;other features. By only accepting links predicted by&nbsp;this classifier with a relatively high confidence value&nbsp;approximately 50% of all articles could be automatically linked, with an error rate of 0.5%. Some genres&nbsp;were underrepresented in the automatically linked set&nbsp;and were manually expanded upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data set resulting from phase 1 was then used to create a training and test set for the actual genre&nbsp;classifier. This, again, involved taking several steps:&nbsp;first, the OCR for the articles in the set was retrieved&nbsp;and cleaned of quoted text by means of regular expressions. Next, the remaining text was pre-processed with&nbsp;the Natural Language Processing software package&nbsp;Frog, performing tasks such as segmentation, tokeni-zation, and part-of-speech tagging. From the resulting&nbsp;annotated text, the relevant features for each article&nbsp;were calculated, such as number of words, number of&nbsp;sentences, number of direct quotes removed, and,&nbsp;most importantly, number of adjectives and various&nbsp;types of pronouns found in the text. These features, together with the existing genre labels were finally used&nbsp;to train a Support Vector Machine to choose one of&nbsp;eight possible genres for each article, ranging from&nbsp;news report and interview to news analysis and opinion article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The initial results we obtained with this classifier were quite promising. Our first attempt resulted in an&nbsp;accuracy score of 58%, with the default accuracy by&nbsp;predicting the majority class or genre being 46%. The&nbsp;confusion matrix made from the predictions provides&nbsp;important information about which genres are most&nbsp;difficult to predict and what mistakes are most commonly made. This information can help us to fine-tune&nbsp;the existing features. Moreover, we have not yet implemented all the textual features that typify the different&nbsp;genres, such as named entities occurring in the text,&nbsp;sentiment, or self-classification to name only a few. Finally, we will compare the results of different algorithms, including deep learning approaches. Based on&nbsp;this, we expect to be able to improve these initial results in the coming months and present our final results in more detail at the conference.</span></p>
