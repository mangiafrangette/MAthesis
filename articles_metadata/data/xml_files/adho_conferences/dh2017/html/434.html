<p><span class="font3">This paper considers an evolving genre of digital scholarship in the humanities, the thematic research&nbsp;collection, which is distinguished among other kinds&nbsp;of scholarly production as a collection of primary&nbsp;sources, gathered by scholarly effort and made available online to support research on a theme (Palmer,&nbsp;2004). There are hundreds of such collections on the&nbsp;Web, ranging from well-known digital archives to&nbsp;small collections of historical or literary evidence&nbsp;within a thematic niche.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite recognition of the genre (e.g., Price, 2009; Flanders, 2014; and Thomas, 2015), we do not know&nbsp;enough about this mode of production, how it contributes to humanities discourse, or how it relates to systems of peer review, discovery, and long-term maintenance. The evolution of public-facing humanities&nbsp;scholarship, long-term access to collections, and the&nbsp;completeness of the scholarly record depend in part&nbsp;on a more systematic understanding of this and other&nbsp;emergent genres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through typological analysis, this research aims to build a foundation for rigorous study of thematic research collections. The goals of typology are to understand the breadth and variety of a genre, and identify&nbsp;unanticipated variations. We take up the following&nbsp;questions: What types of collections can we usefully&nbsp;distinguish, and what can these types and their characteristics reveal about the challenges and opportunities confronting the growth of digital scholarship in&nbsp;the humanities?</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">We conducted a pilot survey of the digital humanities landscape to identify a set of resources meeting our definition. Sources for the survey included digital&nbsp;humanities centers, library publishing programs, tools&nbsp;and platforms for digital publishing, and scholarly col-lectives/peer review organizations. While not comprehensive of the digital humanities landscape, the&nbsp;survey produced a set of 98 diverse collections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our typology followed the formal process described by Kluge (2000):</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop relevant analyzing properties.&nbsp;Properties reflect our intuitions about interesting differences between collections,&nbsp;within this context of scholarly work and&nbsp;use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group members by distinct combinations&nbsp;of properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze meaningful relationships and&nbsp;construct types.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat earlier steps if needed to accommodate collections that do not fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We iterated our analysis, refining our sense of properties and resultant types, until we were satisfied&nbsp;that our types speak to important and revelatory differences among collections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our proposed typology of thematic research collections relies on the following four properties of collections, which are basically determinative of their potential uses: (A) Whether primary sources are the main content of the collection, or are ancillary; (B) Whether&nbsp;the collection employs advanced markup, to enable&nbsp;use beyond basic keyword search; (C) Whether the&nbsp;collection's primary purpose is pedagogical; and (D)&nbsp;Whether the collection solicits, or actively engages in&nbsp;the collection of new or original evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 98 collections in our set resolve into 5 types, per different combinations of these properties. Figure&nbsp;1 shows how types are derived from a matrix of properties, along with the number of collections that fall&nbsp;into each type. Figure 2 visualizes the types in a projected, three-dimensional property space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We can briefly describe the types as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Type 1. Traditional collections with enabling&nbsp;markup: Marked-up (usually textual) primary sources constitute the main content of&nbsp;the collection, and are accessible directly by&nbsp;search and other functionalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Type 2. Traditional collections without enabling markup: These are more heterogeneous in content, but primary sources are still&nbsp;directly accessible as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font3">Type 3. Data-centric or derivative-centric collections: While primary sources are a major component, they are not directly accessible as such. Rather, access is mediated by an&nbsp;analytic or interpretive layer, such as an interactive map or 3D model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font3">Type 4. Pedagogical collections: They resemble one of the above types, but are distinguished by their intended purpose and audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• </span><span class="font3">Type 5. Original or soliciting collections: They resemble one of the above types, but&nbsp;are distinguished by the scope and processes&nbsp;of their development (specifically, they are&nbsp;collecting new primary sources).</span></p><img src="434_files/434-1.jpg" style="width:239pt;height:74pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3">We hope the systematic identification of properties of a broad range of collections and preliminary types&nbsp;may serve as a foundation for ongoing study of how&nbsp;collections work, and how they may be served (or not)&nbsp;by systems of evaluation, discovery, and long-term&nbsp;maintenance. The full version of this poster details&nbsp;methods, properties, and types with vivid examples,&nbsp;and considers the implications of types for effective&nbsp;and ongoing access to collections.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
