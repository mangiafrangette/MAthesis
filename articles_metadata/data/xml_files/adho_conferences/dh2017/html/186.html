<p><span class="font3">This poster presents research into integration and assessment of digital humanities pedagogy in a distance course on the History of Children's Literature,&nbsp;and provokes conversation about pedagogical approaches that expand student access to DH methods,&nbsp;tools, and dispositions. Much of the existing literature&nbsp;on DH pedagogy addresses methods courses or multimodal writing courses rather than integration of DH&nbsp;practices in particular topical contexts, or advanced&nbsp;topics courses that explore a narrow slice of disciplinary content through extended engagements with digital projects (Ball 2012; Mostern &amp; Gainor 2013; Fyfe&nbsp;2016; Nyhan, Mahony, and Terras 2016). This literature provides valuable lessons but raises questions&nbsp;about the feasibility of engaging with DH across the&nbsp;curriculum in small-to-medium scale engagements&nbsp;with new methods and technologies. Amy E. Earhart&nbsp;and Toniesha L. Taylor (2016), for example, respond&nbsp;to this situation by rejecting the idea that DH should&nbsp;be limited to advanced courses and propose broader&nbsp;integration of “embedded [DH] skills development”&nbsp;that students can take out of the environment of a specific institution. Similarly, we suggest that allowing for&nbsp;repeated and diverse engagement by students across&nbsp;methods-intensive and topic-intensive courses (as is&nbsp;now common for writing) is necessary for teaching&nbsp;deeper DH dispositions like collaboration, openness to&nbsp;failure, and creativity with technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Simultaneously, the existing literature has focused on residential instruction with access to physical artifacts. This limit is problematic when at least one discipline with a heavy investment in DH, library and information science, is well past transition to a majority distance learning population. LIS programs have developed experience and expertise in teaching technology&nbsp;at a distance, and lessons from these programs may be&nbsp;useful to the DH community. While some teaching&nbsp;goals may only be met in person, others might be&nbsp;achieved through well-structured online learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To ground this discussion, the authors, the course instructor, and a subject librarian will present their&nbsp;development, assessment, and rethinking of a multimodal publication assignment using the Scalar platform in a synchronous online course on the History of&nbsp;Children's Literature. Students worked in groups to&nbsp;create a multi-media web resource on “diverse history.” The class discussed what is included or omitted&nbsp;from historical narratives, whether they be children's&nbsp;historical fiction or history textbooks, before contemplating this selection process in children's literature itself. The librarian introduced students to the context&nbsp;of DH publishing and Scalar, and to issues related to&nbsp;responsible use of multimedia. Then each group chose&nbsp;an issue related to “diverse history” and built one section of the website. The long-term goal is for successive classes to edit, revise, and expand this project</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This collaborative project replaced an assignment from previous years, when students built individual&nbsp;websites about a children's book of their choice. This&nbsp;project maximized scaffolding, with detailed guidance&nbsp;on information students should locate about their&nbsp;books and the final website shape. This iteration of the&nbsp;class took place during a time when distance students&nbsp;came to campus one weekend each semester, and this&nbsp;time was used for in-depth introduction to the array of&nbsp;specialized library resources needed to complete the&nbsp;questions about their book's production and reception. The new assignment sought to re-imagine learning outcomes that would allow students to engage&nbsp;with a particular DH publishing technology, Scalar,&nbsp;and grapple with issues of collaboration and multimodal authoring in a context where the final product&nbsp;was less predetermined. Nonetheless, the elimination&nbsp;of the in person component, which occurred at the&nbsp;same time, removed an obvious “lab” opportunity for&nbsp;learning related technical issues. The pedagogical design involved making the best balance between asynchronous and synchronous activities to compensate&nbsp;for the absence of in person activities. Our evaluation&nbsp;of the success of the assignment relied on assessment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of Scalar sample sites and final projects created by the students, as well as on reflective essays written by the&nbsp;students and observations made in the course of student consultations. This evaluation led to ideas for&nbsp;how to revise the course for future semesters to improve learning of collaborative behaviors, openness to&nbsp;failure, and creativity with technology. This includes,&nbsp;most notably, a re-envisioning of how synchronous&nbsp;class time is used in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By sharing our experiences in developing, teaching, assessing, and revising this course in successive iterations, we hope to explore with attendees the ways in&nbsp;which DH methods, tools, and dispositions can proliferate across the curriculum. We will promote discussion of what DH methods, tools, and dispositions can&nbsp;be taught well in different settings, whether that&nbsp;means varying scales of integration in DH classrooms,&nbsp;or exploring what can be taught virtually versus in&nbsp;person.</span></p>
