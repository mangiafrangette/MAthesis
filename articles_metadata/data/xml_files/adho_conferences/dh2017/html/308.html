<p><span class="font4">The structured repositories in cultural heritage have become the most used infrastructure for&nbsp;knowledge management towards different kinds of&nbsp;systems and platforms, ensuring a complete&nbsp;interoperability and reachability of data. Thanks to the&nbsp;semantic web paradigm, we are able to manage and&nbsp;enrich our data using formalisms and data standards:&nbsp;examples include digital libraries and digital archives,&nbsp;as well as SPARQL endpoints. However, the&nbsp;fragmentation of data produced by different kinds of&nbsp;mapping methodologies and different representations&nbsp;of the knowledge to be managed leads to some&nbsp;discrepancies between domains and results obtained&nbsp;during data retrieval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A typical example is the study of an inscription, which will be addressed by linguists with regards to&nbsp;language; by philologists with regards to its text; by&nbsp;historians as a primary source; by archaeologists as&nbsp;material testimony of events and by conservationists&nbsp;as a piece of matter to be preserved and restored. In&nbsp;that scenario, semantic interoperability and&nbsp;standardization are two fundamental elements as they&nbsp;guarantee the circulation of knowledge inside a shared&nbsp;environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paper aims to present the methodology followed in the Nurcara Project concerning resource&nbsp;integration and knowledge management. Nurcara&nbsp;consists of a dataset (almost 300 records) composed&nbsp;of textual Latin documents from the Medieval Age that&nbsp;provide historical context for the area of Monteleone&nbsp;Rocca Doria in Sardinia (Sassari, Italy) between the&nbsp;11<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries. Starting from an SQL database,&nbsp;our solution focuses on the development of a semantic&nbsp;framework solution able to both automatically map&nbsp;the relational dataset in CIDOC-CRM ontology on-the-fly and aggregate the knowledge from different&nbsp;repositories or endpoints. This method aims to&nbsp;semantically enrich Nurcara’s dataset with external&nbsp;resources from the same domain, such as SPARQL-endpoint and Linked Data resources.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nurcara project</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Nurcara started from the following directive: to make accessible to the community the huge amount of&nbsp;published and unpublished medieval documents&nbsp;about Monteleone Rocca Doria that until now have&nbsp;been only accessible from the researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thanks to a collaboration between the Spanish Ministry of Cultural Heritage and the University of&nbsp;Sassari, it has been possible to start archival research&nbsp;of historical documents from the National Archive of&nbsp;Cagliari, the Historical Archive of Alghero and the&nbsp;General Archive of the Crown of Aragon in Spain.&nbsp;During the research almost 300 medieval documents&nbsp;in Latin, Catalan, Castilian and Sardinian were&nbsp;cataloged and stored in a MySQL database. The&nbsp;documents dated from the 11<sup>th</sup> to 15 <sup>th</sup> centuries and&nbsp;related to Monteleone Rocca Doria (SS), which made&nbsp;them useful for defining the socio-economic context of&nbsp;the area during the medieval age.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Interoperability and semantic enrichment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The interoperability and semantic enrichment of the data represents one of the most important&nbsp;milestone of the project. It is crucial to publish the&nbsp;dataset in an accessible format with Semantic Web&nbsp;technology such as SPARQL or Linked (Open) Data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to reach our goal, we started with the conceptualization of the entities from the relational&nbsp;database and the definition of the semantic schema.&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">CIDOC-CRM</span><span class="font4"> has been chosen as the main reference&nbsp;model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CIDOC-CRM is an ontology created in order to offer “definitions and a formal structure for describing the&nbsp;implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used&nbsp;in cultural heritage documentation”. The CIDOC-CRM&nbsp;model is a semantically rich model used to&nbsp;conceptualize the cultural heritage domain composed&nbsp;of 86 classes and 138 properties. The purpose of&nbsp;CIDOC-CRM is to provide a common definition for&nbsp;heterogeneous forms of information, and to enable&nbsp;their integration despite possible semantic and&nbsp;structural incompatibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to translate data stored in the Nurcara relational database to the CIDOC-CRM ontology&nbsp;(expressed in RDF-Resource Description Framework)&nbsp;we have used the D2RQ tool that will provide an&nbsp;automatic mapping between the relational database&nbsp;and the CIDOC mapping schema.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">D2RQ is a popular mapping platform for publishing relational data as a virtual RDF graph. It enables legacy&nbsp;relational databases to be exposed on the Web,&nbsp;according to the principles of Linked Data, and to be&nbsp;included in the Semantic Web. D2RQ exposes&nbsp;relational databases as SPARQL endpoints. It&nbsp;translates SPARQL queries posed on a virtual RDF&nbsp;graph to SQL queries posed to the underlying&nbsp;relational database.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mapping Solution</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The mapping process started with the definition of the main entities useful for the definition of the&nbsp;conceptual model directly from Nurcara’s database:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Document (E84 Information Carrier)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Author (E39 Actor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Issue place (E53 place)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Issue date (E50 Date)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Type (E55 Type)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Title (E35 title)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We chose these entities as a starting point for the mapping activities because from a conceptual point of&nbsp;view, they cover the minimum knowledge&nbsp;representation useful for the description of the&nbsp;documents from Nurcara’s database. Furthermore,&nbsp;with the aim of defining a more suitable (event-oriented) semantic model with respect to CIDOC-CRM&nbsp;ontology, we defined some “abstract” entities that are&nbsp;outside the structure of Nurcara’s database, but are&nbsp;present as classes in CIDOC ontology:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Dataset (E73 Information Object)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Event (E5 Event)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">Activity (E7 Activity)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here, the use of the abstract classes as an intermediate layer allowed us to guarantee a more detailed and&nbsp;coherent conceptualization of the proposed model&nbsp;with respect to CIDOC-CRM ontology. Then, thanks to&nbsp;definition of the “Dataset” as E73 Information Object,&nbsp;it is possible to extend the proposed model with&nbsp;CRMdig (developed as a compatible extension of&nbsp;ISO21127) application profile from CIDOC-CRM&nbsp;ontology, which allows us to encode metadata about&nbsp;the steps and methods of production of digitization&nbsp;products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The defined conceptual schema has been directly implemented as a mapping file (using D2RQ syntax) in&nbsp;D2RQ in .ttl format, in order to ensure the live mapping&nbsp;process between Nurcara dataset and CIDOC-CRM&nbsp;ontology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to enrich and extend the dataset, we have also considered in the mapping.ttl schema other&nbsp;Linked Data end-points such as DbPedia or Geonames,&nbsp;which are specified by prefix and reachable via a&nbsp;proper SPARQL query directly from D2RQ SPARQL&nbsp;end-point.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Data accessibility</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As previously stated, after the mapping process, the data are expressed and exposed as RDF graph based&nbsp;on CIDOC-CRM structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hyperlinking</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The D2R server supports hyperlink navigation by providing links on the RDF and XHTML levels. Any RDF&nbsp;triple whose object is a dereferenceable URI can be&nbsp;seen as a hyperlink. This is how resources published&nbsp;by the D2R Server are interlinked with other&nbsp;databases and external RDF documents. To aid&nbsp;discovery of related resources, D2R Server includes an&nbsp;rdfs:seeAlso triple with every resource description&nbsp;that points to an RDF document containing links to&nbsp;other resources produced by the same ClassMap (In&nbsp;our case, DbPedia or Geonames). If resources are&nbsp;identified with external URIs, then an additional&nbsp;rdfs:seeAlso link points to a local RDF/XML document&nbsp;that contains everything the database knows about the&nbsp;resource. By dereferencing the external URI and by&nbsp;following the rdf:seeAlso link, RDF browsers can&nbsp;retrieve both authoritative and non-authoritative&nbsp;information about the resource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Search</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The D2R Server allows the users to query non-RDF databases using the SPARQL query language over the&nbsp;SPARQL protocol. Queries are executed against a&nbsp;virtual RDF graph representing the complete&nbsp;database. Query results can be retrieved in the&nbsp;SPARQL query result as XML or in SPARQL/JSON&nbsp;serialization.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of progress in the area of RDF storage, a large quantity of data is still stored in non-semantic&nbsp;repositories or relational databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nevertheless, especially in the domain of the humanities, we are seeing growth in the use of&nbsp;semantic platforms for the management of digital data&nbsp;as a common method of knowledgement management.&nbsp;The CIDOC-CRM ontology is one of the most used in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">digital humanities. In this proposal we want to show how a specific dataset as Nurcara can be successfully&nbsp;integrated under the much more generic CIDOC-CRM&nbsp;structure, and how the knowledge can be easily&nbsp;enriched thanks to LOD integration. In order to reach&nbsp;the goal, the scalability and the full customization&nbsp;offered by the D2RQ server has played a crucial role.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The future development of this project concentrates on the integration of the Description&nbsp;Logic algorithm and reasoning system with the&nbsp;purpose of increasing resource discovery with respect&nbsp;to the domain utilized by the Nurcara project.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h2>
