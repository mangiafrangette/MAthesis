<p><span class="font3">The 1999 film may have been prophetic. The Matrix has us. But our children may have the Matrix. .&nbsp;.under their control. And it can be personalized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This project, now at its seed level, merges performance studies, critical media studies and a&nbsp;reading of Jean Baudrillard's idea of simulations and&nbsp;simulacrum to examine the dramatization of our social&nbsp;reality as it occurs through each evolution of broadcast&nbsp;media in the twentieth century. Since the emergence&nbsp;of broadcast radio, each American generation has&nbsp;interpreted and aesthetically crafted a consensus&nbsp;reality that, with the onset of cable TV and the internet,&nbsp;has become somewhat of a simulation. This project&nbsp;claims that Generation Z (born after 2001) will inherit&nbsp;a social reality that is so highly filtered and&nbsp;aesthetically shaped as to be more of an abstraction of&nbsp;objective truth than narrative drama or even video&nbsp;games. Furthermore, the additional mediation of&nbsp;algorithms designed initially for marketing purposes&nbsp;will provide for Generation Z &quot;realities of choice.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This investigation began as I observed my young daughter asserting her perceived right to choose her&nbsp;digitally delivered entertainment from a seemingly&nbsp;endless menu. The Gen Xers (my generation) are in&nbsp;charge of producing these entertainments, while&nbsp;Millennials form the bulk of the writers. This is strange&nbsp;alchemy, as Gen X produces both documentary and&nbsp;narrative drama that critiques the mythical post-war&nbsp;reality created by Baby Boomers, Millennials&nbsp;internalize and interpret that critique, producing&nbsp;infinite variations on themes by virtue of the sheer&nbsp;number of digital outlets and accessible, user friendly&nbsp;storytelling tools. The conceptual model of&nbsp;generational mediation to be presented, shows the&nbsp;gradual movement away from a relatively objective&nbsp;(or let us say homogenized consensus) social reality to&nbsp;and a multi-cyber-verse of highly mediated realities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The irony is that, while the beauty of this technonarrative state allows an exponentially diversifying population space and accessibility for disseminating&nbsp;their narrative and to communicate their cultural&nbsp;reality; the option to personalize our input, in tandem&nbsp;with our twenty-first century culture of convenience,&nbsp;means that we may never see and experience nor&nbsp;empathize with the lives of “Others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This work marks a continuation of a dissertation on performing myth in virtual realities and the&nbsp;foundational level of a “Generational Reality Theory,”&nbsp;an examination of meaning making, knowledge&nbsp;acquisition and generational ways of being as codified&nbsp;cultural expressions. In other words, because of our&nbsp;emerging ability to perform ourselves and shape our&nbsp;perception of reality wholesale via media spaces, and&nbsp;the likely development of digital (and other virtual)&nbsp;platforms beyond our current imagination, each&nbsp;subsequent generation is living, quite literally, in a&nbsp;different reality to the extent that cross-generational&nbsp;communication - and for professors, andragogy - is&nbsp;equivalent to cross-cultural communication.</span></p>
