<p><span class="font0">During the academic year 2014-15, Dartmouth College launched an informal Digital Humanities&nbsp;initiative. Individual researchers and campus&nbsp;stakeholders already constituted a loose digital&nbsp;humanities network at the college, and had for years,&nbsp;but these projects had not been coordinated through&nbsp;any kind of centralized infrastructure. In spring 2015,&nbsp;Laura Braunstein (Digital Humanities Librarian) and&nbsp;Scott Millspaugh (Instructional Designer), proposed to&nbsp;pilot a faculty residency program during the summer&nbsp;term. Funded by the Dartmouth College Library and&nbsp;Information Technology Services (ITS), the residency&nbsp;program had the following objectives:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prototype a team-based approach to&nbsp;supporting digital humanities projects that&nbsp;could be standardized for future&nbsp;implementation; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to test the capacity of the Library and ITS to&nbsp;support digital humanities projects without&nbsp;recourse to external sources of funding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The project selected for the Residency Program Pilot was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Multimedia in the Long Eighteenth Century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(MMLEC), led by faculty PI Scott Sanders (Assistant&nbsp;Professor of French). The MMLEC project seeks to&nbsp;quantify the frequency with which musical paratext,&nbsp;including both lyrics and musical notation, appear in&nbsp;English- and French-language novels published&nbsp;between 1688 and 1815. Professor Sanders, John&nbsp;Wallace (Research Systems Engineer), and Jill Baron&nbsp;(Romance Languages Librarian) had been&nbsp;collaborating on the project since late 2014, and&nbsp;Sanders and Wallace had already presented a plan for&nbsp;the project at the Digital Libraries for Musicology&nbsp;Workshop 2015. The Residency Program Pilot allowed&nbsp;for the expansion of the core project team and funded&nbsp;the employment of two student workers who created&nbsp;a trained data set under the direction of Mark&nbsp;Boettcher (Senior Programmer and Analyst). The Pilot&nbsp;also led to the involvement of the Digital Library&nbsp;Technologies Group (DLTG), which has assisted in the&nbsp;creation of a bibliographic database, still in&nbsp;development, of published French-language works&nbsp;from the eighteenth-century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Residency Program Pilot was successful in establishing a model for institutional support of other&nbsp;DH projects in the pipeline at Dartmouth and has&nbsp;allowed the Library and ITS to develop a process for&nbsp;evaluating and prioritizing those projects. In the&nbsp;summer of 2016, we renewed the Residency Program&nbsp;for another year with the Jamaican Slave Names&nbsp;Project (JSNP). Our poster will narrativize the&nbsp;development of MMLEC and JSNP within the context of&nbsp;the Residency Program and demonstrate how&nbsp;institutional support of a digital humanities project&nbsp;can help foster community and cross-campus&nbsp;collaboration in the absence of a dedicated DH&nbsp;program or center. We hope to dialogue with&nbsp;colleagues at other international institutions present&nbsp;at DH2017 that have established different models of&nbsp;support for digital projects in the arts and humanities&nbsp;and to offer guidance to those that are initiating crosscampus collaborations within a network of individual&nbsp;researchers, centers, and administrative groups,&nbsp;instead of concentrating digital humanities support&nbsp;within a single program or center.</span></p>
