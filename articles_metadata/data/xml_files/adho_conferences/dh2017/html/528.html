<p><span class="font3">Historical maps are progressively digitized and added to the inventory of digital libraries. Beside their&nbsp;value as historical objects, such maps are an important&nbsp;source of information for researchers in various scientific disciplines. This ranges from the actual history of&nbsp;cartography and general history to the geographic and&nbsp;social sciences. However, for most of these digital libraries, the available metadata include only limited information about the content of the maps, for example&nbsp;author, title, size, and/or creation date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whereas given information extraction methods are designed for modern maps and mostly limited to certain types that share similar graphical features, there&nbsp;exist a limited number of tools that rely on a manual&nbsp;recording to visualize certain properties such as distortions as well as support a content-based querying.&nbsp;Examples concern the development of places over&nbsp;time, toponym changes over time, and the identification of the position of places (historical map vs. modern map). This also applies to place markers and text&nbsp;labels, which contain inherent information and so the&nbsp;annotation and geo-referencing of place markers is a&nbsp;crucial task, which can be supported with computer&nbsp;based tools (Budig and Dijk, 2015, Höhn et al., 2013,&nbsp;Shaw and Bajcsy, 2011, Simon et al., 2011).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As already presented in previous contributions (Höhn and Schommer, 2016, Höhn et al., 2013), the&nbsp;Referencing and Annotation Tool RAT supports an&nbsp;identification of place markers in digitized historical&nbsp;maps. RAT facilitates a geo-referencing by suggesting&nbsp;the most likely modern places based on an estimated&nbsp;mapping. The suggestions can be constrained by additional filters, for example by applying a phonetic&nbsp;search (with the Kölner Phonetik) to places, which&nbsp;sound similar to names given on the map. This allows&nbsp;an identification of modern places, whose historic&nbsp;name has changed over time but where its name still&nbsp;is close. RAT performs a template matching algorithm&nbsp;based on the normalized cross-correlation for the&nbsp;identification of place markers. If there are colored&nbsp;place markers in a map, a color segmentation methodology can be used to detect these markers. With respect to the geo-referencing, RAT uses the implemented phonetic search and an estimation of the positions of the place markers.</span></p><img src="528_files/528-1.jpg" style="width:64pt;height:254pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1. Architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network, which shows the operations used for processing the image</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the original template-based place marker recognition algorithm, we integrated a place&nbsp;marker recognition algorithm based on convolutional&nbsp;neural networks (CNNs; RAT 2.0).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For these algorithms, the user is asked to manually annotate a small subset of the map. Regarding the template-based variant, the user has then to select a template for each type of place marker. From the templates, which are manually chosen by the user, the system creates automatically variations; based on the&nbsp;performance - measured with the annotated small&nbsp;subset of the map -, the best performing template variants are then chosen. In the template-matching algorithm, however, the normalized cross-correlation is&nbsp;used as a similarity measure because of its robustness&nbsp;against changes in brightness and contrast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding the detection trough a convolutional neural network, the manually annotated (small) subset of the map is used and split in a training and validation part. This is used to train the network, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">has - at this stage - a very basic structure. It consists only of convolutional and pooling layers as presented&nbsp;in Figure 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both the template matching approach and the convolutional neural network approach share similar performances. Our tests have shown - for the template matching approach - a detection precision of 98.2%&nbsp;and a recall rate (discovered place markers divided by&nbsp;all existing place markers on the map) of 87.7%. The&nbsp;convolutional neural network approach reaches only a&nbsp;precision of 94.4%, but gives a recall rate of 96.2%. So,&nbsp;there are more place markers found; but the result&nbsp;contains also some more wrong matches in between.&nbsp;Therefore, it depends on the use case, which result is&nbsp;“better”, but for the manual post-correction it seems&nbsp;easier to check the CNN results for those additional&nbsp;wrong matches then finding the missed matches from&nbsp;the template-based approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reason behind the use of the convolutional neural network approach has been an algorithmic limitation of the template matching approach. So far, RAT&nbsp;2.0 uses only a fundamental convolutional system (at&nbsp;present, there are no additional techniques used, like,&nbsp;for example, data augmentation or pre-training).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a future point, we work on training the convolutional neural network on multiple maps in order to find a classification model that learns the characteristics of place markers and that detects these on unseen&nbsp;maps.</span></p>
