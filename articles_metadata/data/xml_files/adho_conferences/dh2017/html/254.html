<p><span class="font2">Over the last few years, the videogame community has seen an increase in the visibility of indie games,&nbsp;particularly ones that focus on serious subjects. Given&nbsp;the name “empathy games” by Minority Media’s&nbsp;Vander Caballero in his 2014 GDC talk, this sub-genre&nbsp;is known for its intense and meaningful narratives that&nbsp;often bring to light traumatic experiences. While the&nbsp;classification of these games under empathy can be&nbsp;problematic as highlighted by Anna Anthropy (2015)&nbsp;and the responses to her game Dys4ia, the&nbsp;phenomenological experience of playing these&nbsp;videogames offers a new perspective through which&nbsp;one can engage understandings of new media&nbsp;aesthetics and narrative design. Moreover, Caballero’s&nbsp;(2014) identification of the “empathy game” category&nbsp;as strategic for project support highlights the&nbsp;development of the sub-genre at a point which&nbsp;methodologies of analyzing these aesthetics and&nbsp;design choices as they relate to the representation of&nbsp;trauma within videogames are needed most. Building&nbsp;on the relevance of the issue as well as the unexplored&nbsp;intersections that such mediation brings to prior&nbsp;understandings of critical theory, this paper will&nbsp;propose a methodology for analyzing representations&nbsp;of trauma in videogames that builds on current work&nbsp;in the field. Moreover, it will explore the theoretical&nbsp;implications of such a method to the model of player&nbsp;experience through remediation in order to offer a&nbsp;broader understanding of the meaningful intersection&nbsp;of trauma narratives and new media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beginning with its most well-known applications in the 1990s with the work of Cathy Caruth (1995, 1996)&nbsp;in literary studies and in the 2000s with the work of&nbsp;Dominick LaCapra (2014) in history, the study of&nbsp;trauma has spread from its Freudian psychoanalytic&nbsp;roots to become a field of study in both the sciences&nbsp;and the humanities. Both of the models developed by&nbsp;and around these two theorists are extremely helpful&nbsp;for literary representations given their foundations in&nbsp;disciplines that largely rely on print media and are&nbsp;able to be applied to different genres given their&nbsp;multidisciplinary foci; however, the study of trauma&nbsp;representations has not yet spread widely to new&nbsp;media applications aside from its application in&nbsp;testimonial media. This exclusion suggests a gap in&nbsp;scholarship for trauma studies as it does not account&nbsp;for how these models of trauma may be useful in or&nbsp;influenced by other media.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the increasing cultural and economic impact of videogames, it is essential that the digital&nbsp;humanities develop a critical framework for&nbsp;understanding and analyzing the intersections of&nbsp;trauma studies and videogames. Tobi Smethurst’s&nbsp;work (2014, 2015a, 2015b) attempts to bridge this&nbsp;gap by identifying how both game studies and trauma&nbsp;studies could benefit from an interdisciplinary&nbsp;application. Smethurst’s doctoral thesis (2015a),&nbsp;explores this intersection to offer a tripartite&nbsp;methodology for analyzing trauma in videogames:&nbsp;interreactivity, empathy, and complicity. This&nbsp;methodology is particularly useful because it&nbsp;examines the rhetorical feedback loop between player&nbsp;and game, which, she argues, creates a very specific&nbsp;experience for representing trauma by implicating the&nbsp;player as a perpetrator, and it works very well for&nbsp;games that are designed to elicit such feedback from&nbsp;players. This methodology, however, does not fully&nbsp;account for videogames being able to represent&nbsp;trauma in ways that do not end in making the player&nbsp;complicit in the trauma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Expanding on this foundation, my paper will discuss the use of videogames as an interactive digital&nbsp;media platform for representing traumatic narratives,&nbsp;identify a methodology for analyzing such&nbsp;representations, and argue for a model that&nbsp;understands play in videogames containing&nbsp;representations of trauma as a form of witnessing.&nbsp;This work will begin by grounding its understanding&nbsp;of trauma as it is defined in literary studies through the&nbsp;works of Caruth (1995, 1996) and LaCapra (2014)&nbsp;respectively and expanding its theoretical framework&nbsp;to the use of digital media through digital narrative&nbsp;and media studies by exploring the affordances of&nbsp;videogames highlighted by Janet Murray (1997) in&nbsp;Hamlet on the Holodeck. Next, I will discuss a&nbsp;methodology for analyzing representations of trauma&nbsp;in videogames that utilizes those media aesthetics and&nbsp;the object’s use of procedural rhetoric as defined by&nbsp;Ian Bogost (2007) in Persuasive Games to create a&nbsp;remediated (Bolter and Grusin, 2000) experience of&nbsp;witnessing as described by Dori Laub (1995) in “Truth&nbsp;as Testimony: The Process and the Struggle.” In doing&nbsp;so, I will discuss how this methodology provides a&nbsp;much needed perspective concerning the intersection&nbsp;of videogames and trauma studies. Additionally, I will&nbsp;argue for a model of representing trauma in&nbsp;videogames that seeks to understand feedback loops&nbsp;with the audience in broader terms, which I will&nbsp;ground in the understanding of videogame ethics as&nbsp;discussed in The Ethics of Computer Games (2009) by&nbsp;Miguel Sicart. Such a model will focus on the mediation&nbsp;of the trauma through the videogame experience and&nbsp;account for the overlapping of ethical systems that&nbsp;exist for the player outside of the gameworld, which, I&nbsp;will argue, helps the player navigate the different&nbsp;levels of witnessing. Together, this combination of&nbsp;theoretical foundations will expand on the current&nbsp;scholarship to offer a more holistic understanding of&nbsp;the potential held by videogames as a medium to&nbsp;represent trauma.</span></p>
