<p><span class="font1">“A book is not an isolated being: it is a relationship, an axis of innumerable relationships.” Jorge Luis Borges's words resonate not only with much of my work&nbsp;on book history, but also with my ongoing digital mapping project of the publishing industry in twentieth-century Argentina. The central aim of my current research is a materially informed look into Borges's process of production in the early part of his literary career (1930-1951): who were his primary publishers?&nbsp;What types of editorial jobs did he hold? Which works&nbsp;were independently printed and which did others&nbsp;fund? What can we tell about his development of aesthetics based on analysis of typography and paper&nbsp;choices? By asking these types of questions about Borges's preferences toward the publication of his own&nbsp;works, we also find that he had a very specific taste for&nbsp;the look and feel of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">others'</span><span class="font1"> books and, in one of his&nbsp;early works from this period, makes a snide, and extremely revealing, remark about second-hand&nbsp;bookstores as nothing more than “turgid purgatories.”&nbsp;In light of the fact that the places in which a book is&nbsp;published, printed, and even purchased are all key&nbsp;characteristics of that specific volume, I am creating a&nbsp;project with Leaflet and Jekyll that allows me to think&nbsp;deeply about the spatial (and temporal) evolution of&nbsp;the process of publication (and, in turn, the circulation&nbsp;of published works) in Jorge Luis Borges's Argentina&nbsp;(1930-1951).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My project has three distinct layers: mapping the industry, grids of contact, and textual materiality. The&nbsp;first layer uses data from books' colophons and publishers' catalogues to pinpoint the locations of Borges's&nbsp;printers, publishing houses, booksellers, and even&nbsp;places of employment throughout the early part of the&nbsp;twentieth century. The second layer draws on biographical information from the individuals involved in&nbsp;the Argentine book industry to highlight their connections and working relationships. The third and final&nbsp;layer consists of a (visual) catalogue of certain physical aspects of the books in question including their covers, any illustrations, samples of typefaces that certain printers utilized, and any colophons or printers'&nbsp;marks. This data also will include a more general descriptive bibliography of all of Borges's works published between 1930 and 1951, as well as works that&nbsp;he edited, prefaced, or translated during this time. In&nbsp;light of the fact that there are virtually no extant publishers' archives from this historical moment in Argentina and, furthermore, that much of the ephemeral&nbsp;print material related to Borges is in private hands, my&nbsp;aim is to provide researchers and any interested parties with an easily accessible reservoir of data for future projects. Moreover, the specific data collection&nbsp;and interfacing used for this project allow for a deeper&nbsp;understanding of Borges's idea of a book as “an axis of&nbsp;innumerable relationships” and, thus, provide insight&nbsp;into the accessibility of materials, scarcity of resources, aesthetic features, and canon formation in Argentina. In a way, I see this project as something that&nbsp;will not only further material studies (related to the&nbsp;book and publishing history) and digital projects in&nbsp;Southern Cone Literature, but also something that will&nbsp;serve a much wider audience.</span></p>
