<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Switzerland, the panorama of scientific research is deemed to be deeply affected by language barriers&nbsp;and strong local academic identities. Is this impression&nbsp;confirmed by data on research projects? What are the&nbsp;factors that best explain the structure of scientific&nbsp;collaborations over the last forty years? Do linguistic&nbsp;regions (Switzerland is divided into three principals)&nbsp;or local academic logics really have an impact onto the&nbsp;mapping of research collaborations and to what&nbsp;extend are they embedded in disciplinary, historical&nbsp;and generational logics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We focus on the very large database of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the principal&nbsp;research funding agency in Switzerland, which lists all&nbsp;the 62,000 projects funded between 1975 and 2015.&nbsp;While scientometric studies generally focus on&nbsp;measuring work - and financial - performance, we aim&nbsp;to raise awareness on pursuing a socio-history analyse&nbsp;of Swiss academic circles by crossing the SNSF data&nbsp;with a prosopographic database of all Swiss university&nbsp;professors in the twentieth century provided by the&nbsp;Swiss Elite Observatory (OBELIS). Beyond the interest&nbsp;for the history of science and universities, we explore&nbsp;the noteworthy technical challenge of a network&nbsp;analysis of nearly 88,000 researchers and more than a&nbsp;million of collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By combining those two databases, we measure the temporality and spatiality of academic collaborations,&nbsp;i.e. to define a way to deal with the volume of&nbsp;information in order to provide not only a global&nbsp;vision but also to enable a fine processing of personal&nbsp;trajectories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sources</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The SNSF database has been placed under an Open Data licence in spring 2016. Called “P3” for “Projects,&nbsp;People, Publications”, it contains detailed information&nbsp;on all the projects funded since 1975 (around 500 per&nbsp;year in the beginning, almost 3,000 per year today, see&nbsp;Fig.1), as well as the whole list of people involved in&nbsp;the projects. The database can sometimes be&nbsp;incomplete about the discipline and institutional&nbsp;affiliation of individuals, since it depends directly on&nbsp;the project submission interface where some fields&nbsp;may be left empty. Thus, this gap is partly offset by the&nbsp;junction with the Swiss professors database that&nbsp;provides systematic data on Swiss professors. Thus,&nbsp;the projects are classified according to a standard tree&nbsp;of scientific disciplines.</span></p><div><img src="201_files/201-1.jpg" style="width:271pt;height:149pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are interested in the 2006-2015 period, ten years during which 25,000 projects involving 45,000&nbsp;people produce a graph of more than 350,000 edges.&nbsp;On the one hand, this short periodization allows us to&nbsp;confront our assumptions to our data before analysing&nbsp;the full corpus. On the other hand, it helps to test the&nbsp;effectiveness of our tools and the interoperability of&nbsp;the two databases to prepare a complete and&nbsp;longitudinal modelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We therefore extracted a 2-mode network of people and projects from the database and then&nbsp;projected it into a 1-mode network of people only (the&nbsp;nature of the link being to be affiliated as collaborators&nbsp;to the same research project). If usually a relatively&nbsp;simple task, the transformation of a 2-mode graph into&nbsp;a 1-mode graph is here greatly complicated by the&nbsp;mass of information to process: when the graph matrix&nbsp;contains billions of positions, most softwares are&nbsp;reaching their limits. We will then divide the dataset&nbsp;into smaller units (here, transforming the network&nbsp;year after year helps make it bearable to a standard&nbsp;processor).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Analysis and Visualisation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The topography of the network obtained for 20062015 (Fig.2) is quite remarkable. The center of the network is not, as it is often, the densest region, which&nbsp;would have meant that a single discipline or field of&nbsp;study was likely to play a role of interface between&nbsp;others. Instead, we observe an almost circular&nbsp;distribution of individuals, recalling other “science&nbsp;maps” based on the organization of institutions of&nbsp;bibliometric analysis (Rafols et al. 2010). Data&nbsp;visualization, and in particular the representation of&nbsp;complex networks, is not an end in itself but a tool for&nbsp;questioning the structure of the dataset (Grandjean&nbsp;2015). But while a further research will focus on more&nbsp;detailed indicators to qualify individual positions (in&nbsp;particular, centrality measures, as detailed by&nbsp;Koschutzki et al. 2005 or Newman 2010), this first&nbsp;overview still shows that some groups of disciplines&nbsp;form very obvious clusters. This is the case of physics&nbsp;(right), medical sciences (bottom left) or earth&nbsp;sciences (top right). Others are sparsely connected or&nbsp;dispersed within other communities, as is particularly&nbsp;the case for disciplines like economics/business&nbsp;studies or chemistry, which seem to be more engaged&nbsp;in interdisciplinary collaborations or projects that&nbsp;include a limited number of employees (large&nbsp;experimental science projects partly explain the&nbsp;density of these groups). We also assume the structure&nbsp;of the network to differ among disciplinary&nbsp;specificities and temporality (Bourdieu, 2004;&nbsp;Gingras, 2012; Heilbron &amp; Gingras, 2015). Are most&nbsp;connected disciplines also the most prestigious ones?</span></p><img src="201_files/201-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:242pt;"/>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Perspectives</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the information contained in the list of projects, we see that it is also possible to assign&nbsp;individuals a disciplinary category extracted from the&nbsp;projects involving them. As it happens that a&nbsp;researcher is participating to projects labelled in&nbsp;different disciplines, this approach will lead to a&nbsp;reflexion on the measurement of interdisciplinarity&nbsp;within a comparative study between a selection of «&nbsp;open » and « closed » disciplines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We will also see that it is possible to develop a multi-level analysis to compare the graph clustering to&nbsp;the many Swiss institutional and disciplinary «&nbsp;geographies », in order to historicize their&nbsp;development.</span></p>
