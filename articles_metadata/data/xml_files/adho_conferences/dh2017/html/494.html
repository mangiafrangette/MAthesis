<p><span class="font5">Can novelists create characters with distinct voices as reflected in each character's wordprint? We explored the literary skills of four prominent nineteenth&nbsp;century authors who are generally considered to have&nbsp;been experts in creating characters within their novels:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Jane Austen </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">-Pride and Prejudice</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sense and Sensibility</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Charles Dickens - </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Oliver Twist</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Expectations</span><span class="font5">,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">James Fennimore Cooper - </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Last of the&nbsp;Mohicans</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Deerslayer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Mark Twain - </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Tom</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sawyer</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Applying stylometric analysis using non-contextual words and principle components analysis, we found:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The voice of the narrator in each novel was different than the characters in the novel, and the narrator's</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">voice did not match the author's own wordprintvoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Each author's characters were distinctively</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">different amongst themselves and also different from other authors' characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The authors displayed varying ability to create distinctive characters, with Dickens'&nbsp;characters being the most distinctive followed by Twain's, Austens' and Cooper's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We conclude that talented authors can create characters with distinctive voices and that authors have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">differing ability to do so.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Since is it widely accepted that authors tend to have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their own unique writing style, and since it is also</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">widely accepted that authors are not able to disguise</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their overall writing style, it is reasonable to ask if novelists can create different voices for the characters in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their books. The appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this research question are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Null Hypothesis: A novelist's characters do&nbsp;not have distinctive voices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Alternative Hypothesis: At least some of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">novelist's characters have distinctive voices. Tim Hiatt and John Hilton (1990 and 1993) consid</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ered the question of character voice for William Faulkner, James Joyce, Mark Twain and Robert Heinlein and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">concluded that although an author could create character voices, of the author they tested Faulkner alone was uniquely able to create characters with differing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">voices. However, we noted that their analyses were simplistic and did not use the multivariate statistical</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">techniques commonly used current in stylometric analysis. Therefore, we chose to test the null hypothesis of non-distinctive character voices based on noncontextual word frequencies and using principle components analysis (PCA).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">We applied PCA to novels written by Jane Austen,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Charles Dickens, James Fennimore Cooper and Mark Twain (Samuel Clements). We selected two novels&nbsp;from each author and separated the words quoted by&nbsp;each character. We only included characters whose</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">quoted words exceeded 500 words. Austen created sixteen characters in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pride and Prejudice</span><span class="font5"> and fourteen</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">characters in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sense and Sensibility</span><span class="font5"> who met the minimum number of quoted words, while Dickens created</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">twenty-three characters in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Oliver Twist</span><span class="font5"> and fourteen</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Great Expectations</span><span class="font5">. Similarly, Cooper created twelve characters in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Last of the Mohicans</span><span class="font5"> and ten in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deerslayer</span><span class="font5">, and Twain created nine characters </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span><span class="font5"> and fourteen in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="font5">. We then split each character's quoted words into 200 word blocks for analysis. Since each book also had a narrator, we also split the&nbsp;narrator's words into 2000-word blocks.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Results and Discussion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Figure 1 shows plots of the first two principle components for the four authors where each star dot represents a 2000-word block for the narrator and each circle dot represents a 200-word block for each character. Each novel's narrator clearly stands out from&nbsp;the characters in the book. It can also be seen in Figure&nbsp;1 that the narrator's voices are similar for Austen's,&nbsp;Dickens', and Cooper's novels, while the narrator&nbsp;voices in Twain's novels are distinguishable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although we do not show the plots here, a similar analysis as in Figure 1 comparing the author's own&nbsp;wordprint voice based on non-contextual word frequencies in the author's non-novel writing to the narrator's voice in each novel showed that the narrators'&nbsp;wordprints did not match the author's own wordprint&nbsp;for all four novelists</span></p><img src="494_files/494-1.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:212pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: Principle components plots for the 19 century authors. The narrator's voice is clearly distinguishable from&nbsp;the characters' voices within each novel, and there is&nbsp;obvious diversity of voices among each author's characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the narrators for each author are obviously different in function word frequencies than the characters in each book, we only used the non-narrator&nbsp;words to compare the distinctiveness of the voices&nbsp;each author created for his or her characters. Again using PCA we applied multivariate analysis of variance&nbsp;(MANOVA) and constructed 95% confidence ellipsoids around the characters in each author’s books.&nbsp;Figure 2 shows the ellipsoids using the first two principle components. Each dot in the plots represents one</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">character. Each ellipsoid shows the diversity of character voices for one novel.</span></p><img src="494_files/494-2.jpg" style="width:242pt;height:204pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 2: Principle components plots with 95% confidence ellipsoids for each author's characters by novel. The&nbsp;character voices are distinguishable between each novel for&nbsp;all four authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It can be seen in Figure 2 that the character voices in one novel are distinguishable from the character&nbsp;voices in the other novel for each author, even though&nbsp;there is some overlap of the ellipsoids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The volumes of the ellipsoids for each author provide a measure of that author’s character diversity -the larger the volume, the greater the diversity of character voices within a novel. Figure 3 shows a comparison across authors of the total volume of a 95% confidence ellipsoid encompassing both of each author’s novels.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Log<sub>10</sub>(Volume) vs. Number of PCs</span></h1><img src="494_files/494-3.jpg" style="width:170pt;height:111pt;"/>
<p><span class="font3">Austen</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">^—Cooper</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dickens</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Twain</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 3: The volume of a 95% confidence ellipsoid encompassing the character voices of both novels for each&nbsp;author compared across all four authors. The logio is&nbsp;shown when the ellipsoid includes from two to fifteen&nbsp;principle components. For eight principle components and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">above, the diversity of character voices for Dickens is clearly greater than for the other three authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It can be seen in Figure 3 that Dickens and Twain show greater character diversity than Austen and&nbsp;Cooper. For example, Dickens' character diversity&nbsp;(measured by ellipsoid volume with fifteen principle&nbsp;components) is about one hundred times bigger than&nbsp;Austen's. This shows that even among great authors,&nbsp;there is a spectrum of ability in creating character&nbsp;voices.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">We examined the diversity of character voices created by four of the most respected nineteenth century novelists as shown in their characters' functional word&nbsp;frequencies. Using stylometric analyses we considered&nbsp;whether or not an author can create characters with&nbsp;different wordprint voices and found persuasive evidence that they can. We also found that the narrator in&nbsp;each novel speaks with a different voice than the characters and a different voice than the author's own nonnovel voice. Further, not only can a talented author&nbsp;create characters with differing voices among characters within a novel, the characters are different among&nbsp;novels. In addition, we found that authors exhibit varying ability to create character voice diversity. Although all four were great novelists and could created&nbsp;distinctive characters, Dickens' and Twain's characters showed even greater voice diversity than Austen&nbsp;and Cooper.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></h1>
