<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bernoulli-Euler Online </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">(BEOL</span><span class="font4">) is an interdisciplinary research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation focusing on the mathematics influenced by the Bernoulli dynasty and Leonhard Euler. It&nbsp;is being carried out by the Bernoulli Euler Centre and&nbsp;the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Basel.&nbsp;Its main goal is the integration of different edition projects relating to the Bernoullis and Leonhard Euler into&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> target platform, offering appropriate functionality&nbsp;for researchers interested in the history of science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The methodological efforts will also be applicable to other editions since they are developed in a generic&nbsp;way. BEOL is based on Knora, a generic infrastructure&nbsp;for humanities data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BEOL aims at integrating three edition projects, that are currently all technically different and thus incompatible with one another:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Basler Edition der Bernoulli-Briefwechsel</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">(BEBB)</span><span class="font4">: BEBB is an online edition that is based on the MediaWiki software and hosted&nbsp;by the University Library of Basel. It is connected to the library's metadata catalogue&nbsp;for manuscripts (Basler Inventar der Ber-noulli-Briefwechsel)<sup>_</sup> The letters are encoded in Wiki markup and are converted to&nbsp;HTML to represent them on the web. The&nbsp;mathematical formulae are encoded in LaTeX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leonhardi Euleri Opera Omnia</span><span class="font4"> (LEOO): LEOO&nbsp;is a printed edition of the works of Leonhard&nbsp;Euler that was begun in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. In the context of BEOL, the volume containing Euler's correspondence with Christian Goldbach (Euler 2015) will be integrated as a proof of concept. This volume has&nbsp;been prepared using LaTeX (as well as the&nbsp;volume with Euler's correspondence with&nbsp;Daniel Bernoulli that has been published recently). We expect to be able to integrate all&nbsp;the other recent volumes set in LaTeX in a&nbsp;similar manner. For the older volumes, the&nbsp;printed books would have to be scanned (including OCR) and marked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob (I) Bernoulli's scientific notebook </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Med-itationes</span><span class="font4">: The manuscript is held in the university library of Basel (shelfmark L Ia 3, 367&nbsp;pages) and has already been </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">digitized</span><span class="font4">. The&nbsp;manuscript consisting of 287 entries is being&nbsp;transcribed at the Bernoulli Euler Centre using XML (The XML format is specified closely&nbsp;to the TEI specifications P5, so it can be&nbsp;transformed quite easily to TEI/XML) for the&nbsp;text and LaTeX for the mathematical notation&nbsp;that is embedded in the XML.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three edition projects do not only overlap thematically, but also in terms of the persons involved (authors, mentioned persons) and bibliographical items (literature referred to in the texts, references in-between the editions' texts). Letters exchanged between&nbsp;members of the Bernoulli dynasty, Leonhard Euler and&nbsp;contemporary mathematicians and scientists are an&nbsp;important part of these edition projects and thus it is&nbsp;desirable to identify and match the persons in all editions in order to display their relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The technical basis for BEOL is Knora, an infrastructure for humanities data (Rosenthaler and others 2015) consisting of an RDF-triplestore, an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">OWL base&nbsp;ontology</span><span class="font4">, and a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">RESTful API</span><span class="font4"> that allows for querying&nbsp;and adding to the data. The base ontology (see prefix&nbsp;‘Knora' in Figure 1) defines common value types (such&nbsp;as a calendar independent format to represent dates&nbsp;using the Julian Day Number) used among humanities&nbsp;projects and can be further extended in project specific&nbsp;ontologies. BEOL will provide such an ontology (see&nbsp;prefix ‘BEOL' in Figure 1), defining its own resource&nbsp;classes and properties needed to represent the edition&nbsp;projects' texts and entities. Wherever possible, existing ontologies will be reused by making subclasses and&nbsp;subproperties. BEOL is part of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">NIE-INE projec</span><span class="font4">t,&nbsp;which aims to create a general-purpose infrastructure&nbsp;for digital editions, using Knora as its technical foundation. A focus of this project will be abstracting out&nbsp;concepts shared by different projects and formalising&nbsp;them as ontologies.</span></p><img src="147_files/147-1.jpg" style="width:223pt;height:165pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Figure 1: BEOL network and its components</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Figure 1 represents all relations between persons (We refer to the Integrated Authority File (GND), and in order to represent locations, we will also refer to&nbsp;GeoNames), letters, and manuscripts (we also link to&nbsp;the catalogue of the Basel university library that keeps&nbsp;many of the original copies of the letters and manuscripts of BEOL), as well as their properties as directed&nbsp;graphs. For reasons of clarity, we use a simplified&nbsp;model here. The coloured rectangles indicate that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">these have been imported from different edition projects which - considered in isolation - do not allow for this kind of overview. Moreover, indices and bibliographies have to be unified on the BEOL platform (e.g.,&nbsp;Christian Goldbach occurs both in BEBB and LEOO).&nbsp;The BEOL platform will be connected to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Early Modern&nbsp;Letters Online</span><span class="font4">, so it will be interoperable with other&nbsp;edition projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Importing editions to the same target environment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to represent all three editions in the same target environment, they have to be homogenised first.&nbsp;We decided to do so using an XML-based approach.&nbsp;This has the additional advantage that we can make&nbsp;both the texts of BEBB and LEOO available as TEI/XML&nbsp;to the outside world quite easily by applying XSL transformations. We can also use the same routine to import&nbsp;the editions into BEOL. Knora converts XML-encoded&nbsp;texts to RDF in order to store them in the triplestore.&nbsp;From RDF, an XML document can be recreated that is&nbsp;equivalent to the one originally imported. A </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mapping&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">defines the relations between XML elements and attributes and the entities defined in the ontology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEBB Wiki markup can be transformed to&nbsp;XML using a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">MediaWiki parse</span><span class="font4"> . Wiki tags and&nbsp;structures are mapped to XML tags, and references to other letters, bibliographical&nbsp;items, and images (facsimiles of the letters)&nbsp;can be handled. Once the letters are available&nbsp;on the BEOL platform, the old URLs will have&nbsp;to be forwarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goldbach-volume of LEOO is set in LaTeX and can be converted to XML using </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">La-TeXML</span><span class="font4">. Additional mappings to the available&nbsp;standard functionality and customisations&nbsp;can be provided using Perl scripts. LaTeXML&nbsp;provides a MathML conversion for mathematical formulae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Meditationes are transcribed in an XML-based format (see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">LaTeXML</span><span class="font4">). Derived texts&nbsp;of these files can be generated using XSL-transformations. In this way, several layers&nbsp;(diplomatic, normalized) of the text can be&nbsp;produced. Our approach addresses segments&nbsp;defined on the facsimile (see Figure 2) and&nbsp;turns them into a reading text step by step.&nbsp;The figures (see segment ‘M151-03-F' in Figure 2</span><span class="font0">Figure </span><span class="font4">) will be extracted by applying a&nbsp;combination of various image processing&nbsp;techniques and redrawn as vector graphics.</span></p><div><img src="147_files/147-2.jpg" style="width:229pt;height:191pt;"/>

<p><span class="font4">One of the main challenges in the BEOL project is the faithful representation of mathematical notation&nbsp;and its relation to the surrounding text (see Figure 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">using web technologies. At the moment, we are using</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MathJax (which accepts both LaTeX and MathML as input formats)_to render the mathematical formulae in the web browser. We also consider MathML as an option, although not all web browsers fully support&nbsp;MathML.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are aiming at developing a browser based user interface that will be based on the Angular 2 framework (although in the meantime, we are already using&nbsp;Knora's current interface, SALSAH) that not only&nbsp;makes it possible to present the texts on the web and&nbsp;to offer search functionality, but also to add to the data&nbsp;(sufficient permissions provided). The users may create their own annotations on the BEOL platform. Basically, the user interface interacts with the Knora API in&nbsp;order to create new resources, manipulate properties&nbsp;etc. Since BEOL is based on Knora, all of its generic&nbsp;functionality can be used for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BEOL integrates three different edition projects into one platform and allows researchers to query previously separated contents and add to them. The specific problems posed by the combination of text and&nbsp;mathematical notation can be addressed in a generic&nbsp;manner. All the functionality to be developed will be&nbsp;part of Knora and can be reused by other projects dealing with scientific texts from mathematics and physics.</span></p>
