<p><span class="font2">Pierre Bourdieu has theorized culture as a field, a space constituted by the structural hierarchies and&nbsp;interactions among people and institutions. These&nbsp;relations encompass social and economic positions;&nbsp;competitive and cooperative intentions; as well as&nbsp;what he calls “position-takings”— all of the actions or&nbsp;decisions that produce a work of art and its cultural&nbsp;value. In order to understand the history of literature,&nbsp;Bourdieu argues that we must examine how its&nbsp;meaning and cultural significance gets produced&nbsp;within the cultural field: “the sociology of art and&nbsp;literature has to take as its object not only the material&nbsp;production but also the symbolic production of the&nbsp;work, i.e. the production of the value of the work”&nbsp;(Bourdieu, “Field” 37). Anthologies are a central&nbsp;mechanism in the symbolic production of artistic&nbsp;value as they present a selective literary canon as&nbsp;representative of a defined field of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Anthologies of literature thus both reflect and contribute to the structure of the cultural field,&nbsp;whether by reproducing its hierarchies of value or by&nbsp;contesting them. Anthologies frequently reprint some&nbsp;number of texts that have already been anthologized,&nbsp;along with new selections that may themselves over&nbsp;time become canonical. The changing selections&nbsp;presented in literary anthologies over time offer a&nbsp;microcosm of the field of cultural production as&nbsp;modeled by Bourdieu, a “force-field acting on all those&nbsp;who enter it . . . in a differential manner according to&nbsp;the position they occupy there” (Bourdieu, Rules 232).&nbsp;Each decision by an editor about which authors and&nbsp;texts to include in an anthology inevitably responds in&nbsp;some way to the decisions and values previously&nbsp;circulated in the cultural field. Anthologies are an&nbsp;important mechanism by which value gets assigned to&nbsp;particular texts in relation to one another: “Canonicity&nbsp;is not a property of the work itself but of its&nbsp;transmission, its relation to other works in a&nbsp;collocation of works” (Guillory 55). Thus to&nbsp;understand canonicity we must examine the&nbsp;relationships among literary works within the mode of&nbsp;their transmission, the anthology. In this paper I adapt&nbsp;methods of network analysis to examine the structure&nbsp;of the relationships among the poems included in 30&nbsp;anthologies of Victorian literature published from&nbsp;1880-2002.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rationale</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Literary canon formation and change has long been of concern to literary scholars. Writing in 1979, in&nbsp;terms that prefigure our current concerns with the&nbsp;scope of computational analysis, Alastair Fowler&nbsp;admits, “The literature we criticize and theorize about&nbsp;is never the whole. At most we talk about sizable&nbsp;subsets of the writers and works of the past. This&nbsp;limited field is the current literary canon” (97). Fowler&nbsp;defined six types of literary canons arising from&nbsp;various constraints and choices: official, personal,&nbsp;potential, accessible, selective, and critical.&nbsp;Anthologies are frequently taken to represent the&nbsp;literary canon because in themselves they constitute&nbsp;what Fowler calls a “selective canon,” a subset of&nbsp;works chosen by an editor (or editorial team)&nbsp;presumably for particular reasons. Anthologies make&nbsp;works accessible to a wide range of readers and also&nbsp;contribute to (or potentially constrain) the&nbsp;pedagogical canon, the subset of works that are taught&nbsp;(Harris 112-13). Anthologies often reflect the critical&nbsp;canon, as works that become interesting to scholars&nbsp;gradually start showing up in anthologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the so-called “culture wars” of the 1980s-1990s, debates about multiculturalism and changes to the&nbsp;humanities curriculum frequently focused on&nbsp;anthologies and syllabi as synecdoches for university&nbsp;education (Graff). As John Guillory suggests, both the&nbsp;conservative and progressive sides in this debate&nbsp;tended to rely on “an ideology of tradition” which&nbsp;invokes “an autonomous history of literature, which is&nbsp;always a history of writers and not of writing”&nbsp;(Guillory 63). For Guillory and Bourdieu, the history of&nbsp;writing can only be understood in relation to&nbsp;mechanisms of cultural value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When literary scholars write about anthologies, they frequently describe how the selective canon&nbsp;changes over time; examine the ideological&nbsp;assumptions that undergird the selection process; and&nbsp;point out historical or thematic gaps in anthology&nbsp;coverage. Yet the method that they use for doing this&nbsp;primarily rests upon counting authors (Golding,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Harris, Latane). Others use the number of pages allotted to each author as a proxy for importance or&nbsp;weight within the anthology (Bode, Damrosch,&nbsp;Lecker).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such approaches reify the ideology of tradition in assuming that author names alone adequately&nbsp;describe the complexities of literary history. As&nbsp;Guillory suggests, “histories of canon formation, when&nbsp;they consist primarily of a narrative of reputations, of&nbsp;the names which pass in and out of literary&nbsp;anthologies explain nothing. Such narrative histories&nbsp;fail to recognize generic or linguistic shifts which&nbsp;underlie the fortunes of individual authors by&nbsp;establishing what counts as literature at a given&nbsp;historical moment” (Guillory 64). By offering a&nbsp;network analysis approach that allows us to explore&nbsp;“what counts as literature” rather than just “who&nbsp;counted” in different anthologies, we can better&nbsp;understand the structures of value instantiated and&nbsp;reproduced in these collections and thereby better&nbsp;understand the history of taste and value. For&nbsp;example, rather than simply noting the unsurprising&nbsp;fact that the Victorian poet laureate Alfred Tennyson&nbsp;is included in all anthologies of Victorian literature&nbsp;and accepting that he is thereby a canonical figure, this&nbsp;approach allows for discovering more precisely which&nbsp;poems by Alfred Tennyson were valued in 1880, 1930,&nbsp;or 1980, and how those choices corresponded with&nbsp;selections from other poets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Method</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this paper I explore the utility of several different approaches to analyzing the structures of canon&nbsp;formation as represented in poetry anthologies. These&nbsp;include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examining the structure of the bimodal&nbsp;network created between anthologies and&nbsp;poems;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measuring anthology similarity based on&nbsp;textual couplings;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examining the co-printing network created&nbsp;by connecting each poem in an anthology to&nbsp;every other poem printed in that same&nbsp;anthology</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Each of these approaches will be explored&nbsp;using the full dataset and by using&nbsp;chronological slices that will further the&nbsp;understanding of historical changes in the&nbsp;anthology canon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the first approach, I treat the relationships of poems to anthologies as a bimodal affiliate network.&nbsp;Although some researchers avoid bimodal&nbsp;representations of relationships because standard&nbsp;measures of centrality and other metrics do not apply,&nbsp;force-directed visualization of bimodal data “is often&nbsp;extremely effective for transmitting a holistic&nbsp;understanding of the whole dataset” (Borgatti 10).&nbsp;Faust and Borgatti have each recommended&nbsp;approaches to calculating centrality for affiliation&nbsp;networks that I will also explore. I also examine&nbsp;centralization (core-periphery structure) and&nbsp;structural equivalence measures for the affiliation&nbsp;network.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The remaining two approaches derive from established practices in bibliographic network&nbsp;analysis, particularly bibliographic coupling and cocitation analysis. Although co-citation analysis has&nbsp;largely overtaken bibliographic coupling in recent&nbsp;decades, recent comparative studies suggest that the&nbsp;utility of each approach varies depending on the&nbsp;timeframe and construction of the citation dataset&nbsp;(Boyack et al).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bibliographic coupling draws an edge between two documents which each cite a third (Kessler). To&nbsp;understand the similarities among these anthologies, I&nbsp;create a textual coupling network, which consists only&nbsp;of anthology nodes, and create an edge between each&nbsp;anthology that prints the same poem. This network&nbsp;shows the degree of similarity between anthologies&nbsp;and filtering the poem nodes used to create the edge&nbsp;weights allows for exploration of which texts create&nbsp;distinctive differences among the anthologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In co-citation analysis, an edge is created between two documents which are cited together in a third&nbsp;document (Small). In my co-printing network, which&nbsp;consists only of poem nodes, I create an edge between&nbsp;poems that are printed in the same anthology.&nbsp;Calculating modularity for this network reveals&nbsp;clusters of poems that frequently occur together in the&nbsp;same anthology. These clusters are made up of texts by&nbsp;multiple authors and can be used to explore&nbsp;components of canonicity, such as thematic, formal, or&nbsp;aesthetic qualities shared by poems in each cluster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paper argues that network analysis is a useful approach to examine the structure of the cultural field&nbsp;of Victorian poetry as it was constituted in key literary&nbsp;and teaching anthologies published from 1880-2002.</span></p>
