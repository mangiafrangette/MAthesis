<p><span class="font3">In academic contexts, digital games are often studied as texts or are used as pedagogical tools to&nbsp;teach basic concepts in early education situations.&nbsp;Less usefully, their systems and economies are often&nbsp;co-opted and decontextualized in short-sighted&nbsp;attempts to “gamify” various aspects of learning or&nbsp;training. It’s no wonder that digital games often&nbsp;appear as a marginal endeavor in Digital Humanities&nbsp;practices, despite their relative compatibility with the&nbsp;broad scope of DH methods and perspectives.&nbsp;However, given that games are highly controlled,&nbsp;conditional, choice-and-consequence-based, problemsolving environments in which players are expected to&nbsp;interact with simulated settings and elements after&nbsp;agreeing to take on particular roles and subject&nbsp;positions, there are promising potential uses of these&nbsp;experiences in academic contexts that have not been&nbsp;fully considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the unique ways that DH provocations and practices have managed to create a critical lucidity is&nbsp;through making, through the construction of&nbsp;prototypes and through discussions regarding&nbsp;alternative models of perception, narrativity,&nbsp;organization and understanding, enabled through the&nbsp;computer’s multi-media frame. DH work often&nbsp;defamiliarizes and repoliticizes the forms and&nbsp;functions of communication and scholarly work, and&nbsp;continues to challenge socially constructed and&nbsp;sustained institutional habits by asking “What is the&nbsp;relationship between making, thinking, using and&nbsp;critique?” “Thinking through” tools, prototypes,&nbsp;interfaces and platforms and through the narratives&nbsp;that such processes construct, DH-inspired&nbsp;experiments are slowly, but noticeably and&nbsp;provocatively expanding opportunities for scholarly&nbsp;research and communication methods and means.&nbsp;Such changes are the product of an imaginative&nbsp;resistance to traditional limitations and habitual&nbsp;practices in our institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Motivated by the imperative to explore alternative modes and methods of scholarly research and&nbsp;communication, and guided by the values of open&nbsp;social scholarship practices, this paper reconsiders&nbsp;games not as things to study, but as instruments to&nbsp;study with. Given that games can function as&nbsp;simulations, models, arguments and creative&nbsp;collaboratories, game-based inquiry can be used as a&nbsp;potential method of humanities research and&nbsp;communication. While these ideas have been explored&nbsp;in a preliminary way in relation to a few different&nbsp;academic disciplines (Donchin, 1995; Boot, 2015;&nbsp;Mitgutsch and Weise, 2011; Westecott, 2011) this&nbsp;paper will make the case for a humanities-calibrated&nbsp;consideration of the pragmatics and potentials of&nbsp;game-based research, games as instances of critical&nbsp;making, critical intervention and scholarly&nbsp;communication, and more complex forms of game-based learning than those currently practiced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper is not about shifting the focus of existing game paradigms and practices to more productive and&nbsp;instructional/educational ends (as is often done in&nbsp;“serious game” or “edutainment” design). It is an&nbsp;attempt to challenge textually-dependent scholarship&nbsp;with game-based processes while simultaneously&nbsp;challenging conventional game features and functions&nbsp;with scholarly creativity and textual affordances. In&nbsp;other words, I am concerned with renewing the&nbsp;process of scholarly inquiry in the humanities via&nbsp;game creation and experience, akin to the richness of&nbsp;what Joanna Drucker describes as “diagrammatic&nbsp;process.” I have also been inspired by Geoffrey&nbsp;Rockwell’s attempt to avoid the term “serious games”&nbsp;while also promoting the idea that developing and&nbsp;playing through games are viable ways of modeling&nbsp;and reflecting on humanities based research activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several examples will be discussed, including the use of the open-source Twine program in my&nbsp;undergraduate and graduate classes as a simple and&nbsp;accessible game-design engine. Twine can be used to&nbsp;construct environments which ask critical,&nbsp;provocative questions, or which attempt to&nbsp;rhetorically persuade players through interactive&nbsp;experience and interpellative role-playing. Anna&nbsp;Anthropy’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Queers in Love at the End of the World,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Porpentine’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Those We Love Alive,</span><span class="font3"> Mattie Brice’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blink,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Kitty Horrorshow’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Daymare #1: Ritual,</span><span class="font3"> Pippin Barr’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Burnt Matches,</span><span class="font3"> and Zoe Quinn’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Depression Quest,</span><span class="font3"> are&nbsp;examples of Twine being used as an innovative and&nbsp;disruptive game engine. In addition, Merrit Kopas’&nbsp;book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Videogames for Humans,</span><span class="font3"> thoroughly explores&nbsp;and justifies the diversity of game-based experiments&nbsp;in Twine: “Authors are doing things with Twine that&nbsp;aren’t possible with traditional text. And at the same&nbsp;time, they’re using interactive media to tell stories that&nbsp;mainstream videogames couldn’t dream of telling”&nbsp;(Kopas, 2015: 11). My students have used Twine to&nbsp;engage their peers in alternatives to essay&nbsp;communication, and working together to design such&nbsp;experiences involves them in a collaborative form of&nbsp;critical making. Composing a networked narrative in&nbsp;Twine is akin to constellating and curating not only&nbsp;ideas, but multiple pathways through such ideas. This&nbsp;critical mapping process is as important as the&nbsp;selective routing process experienced by players, who&nbsp;trace particular storylines through the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The usefulness of such methods can be demonstrated through an assignment submitted by&nbsp;Rebecca Wilson, one of my graduate students, who&nbsp;used the creative process of designing a Twine-based&nbsp;experience to achieve the following research goals:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better comprehend the relationship&nbsp;between William Blake’s creative process,&nbsp;his biographical context and his prophetic&nbsp;works,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To model and critique his complexity&nbsp;through an emulation of Blake’s own&nbsp;disregard for temporal and spatial&nbsp;consistency and his transitional&nbsp;unpredictability, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore the Twine engine as a site of&nbsp;utopian hope, utopian method and&nbsp;heterotopic tensions (thus responding to&nbsp;and engaging with theoretical ideas&nbsp;advanced by Michel Foucault (1984) and&nbsp;Ruth Levitas 2013)).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Addressing these questions through the methodology of building the gamespace and producing a written&nbsp;reflection on the process is different from the resulting&nbsp;game experience in which players role-play as William&nbsp;Blake, interactively negotiating and determining&nbsp;causal links between everyday experiences,&nbsp;inspirational visions and creative invention. However,&nbsp;both opportunities demonstrate the variety of ways in&nbsp;which games, game engines, and game platforms can&nbsp;be used as instruments for research, scholarly&nbsp;communication and pedagogy. As well, given that&nbsp;Twine’s output is an HTML file that can be served&nbsp;online and accessed through a web browser on&nbsp;multiple devices, Wilson’s </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">work</span><span class="font3"> is now accessible to a&nbsp;much broader audience than an academic paper on the&nbsp;same topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another example of the ways that games can be used as research tools is an in-progress project that is&nbsp;looking to generate feminist game prototypes to&nbsp;facilitate new models, diverse approaches and&nbsp;different narratives to expose war’s patriarchal&nbsp;morphology, to provoke a rethinking of militarised&nbsp;masculinity in the real world and the persistence of&nbsp;hyper-masculinity in idealistic representations of war.&nbsp;These games, designed with alternative value sets to&nbsp;distinguish them from traditionally masculine power&nbsp;fantasies are meant to challenge and realign the values&nbsp;that players become reflexively used to perceiving and&nbsp;employing within mediated scenarios of militarisation&nbsp;and armed conflict. The adoption of feminist value-based design challenges habitual idealisations of war,&nbsp;violence and hyper-masculinity in video game&nbsp;environments through feminist perspectives. Multiple&nbsp;and contradictory feminist war game prototypes can&nbsp;be used to disrupt habits of institutional/personal&nbsp;perception&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;practice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">provocatively/performatively engage players with complex issues of violence, gender and media culture.&nbsp;Incorporating feminist values into a game’s design&nbsp;creates an intervention that promotes critical lucidity&nbsp;for players.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Identifying the need to confront and challenge traditional habits of head, hand, heart and media&nbsp;representation when it comes to game-based&nbsp;perceptions of war (which can reflect and configure&nbsp;attitudes towards war in general) is not unique to this&nbsp;talk. Mary Flanagan, in “Practicing a New Wargame”&nbsp;discusses the perceptual limitations reproduced by&nbsp;conventional wargames and calls for alternative ways&nbsp;of imagining conflict resolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We must look to transcend old conflict models, or we risk perpetuating the damaging&nbsp;myth that there are limited ways of resolving&nbsp;conflicts.... It is vital that game scholars, makers&nbsp;and players see these familiar models on a&nbsp;continuum of change, so new play forms that&nbsp;model new solutions to our problems can be&nbsp;invented. Our games are constantly evolving,&nbsp;and this means we all have an opportunity, even&nbsp;a responsibility, to evolve with them and push&nbsp;ourselves to model the world we wish to&nbsp;create.” (2016: 706)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Flanegan’s call is an important acknowledgement of game design and gamespace as an opportunity to&nbsp;imagine new models. An effort to reimagine, pluralize&nbsp;and critically engage with the ways that we realize and&nbsp;idealize the long history of armed conflict via a critique&nbsp;of naturalized perceptual habits and assumptions&nbsp;directly speaks to the broader need to expose,&nbsp;augment and erode habitual ways of seeing, being,&nbsp;doing and narrating in the humanities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These initial examples justify the use of games as research and scholarly communication methods, as&nbsp;more than just new media texts to interpret, and aligns&nbsp;them with current DH efforts to use computer&nbsp;technology as interventions to challenge, critique and&nbsp;re-humanize systems, ideologies, and habitual&nbsp;narrativities, to pluralize perspectives, confront&nbsp;complexity and facilitate multiple models of&nbsp;perception and practice. The computer is a flexible&nbsp;tool can be used in diverse ways to broaden our&nbsp;understanding of human culture and to generate&nbsp;inclusive, inhabitable and thought-provoking stories.&nbsp;By foregrounding the values of open social scholarship&nbsp;and engaging with broader publics via mechanical&nbsp;extensions of perception and action, these&nbsp;unconventional approaches work in connective,&nbsp;integrative and expansive ways to avoid modelling&nbsp;humanities scholarship on more conventional game&nbsp;mechanisms and goals that unproductively&nbsp;foreground acquisition, exploration and competition.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibliography</span></p>
