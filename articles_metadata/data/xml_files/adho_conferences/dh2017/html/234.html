<p><span class="font3">This paper will discuss recent research carried out in the context of an OMRI-funded project: “The Life of&nbsp;Words: Poetry and the OED.” It will discuss the&nbsp;processes and methods developed for enhancing and&nbsp;manipulating a large legacy dataset—the Second&nbsp;Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary—and will&nbsp;present analyses and applications pertaining to&nbsp;lexicography, lexicology, and traditional literary&nbsp;studies. Styled as an “opening up” of latent information&nbsp;in a previously closed system, and with implications in&nbsp;digital humanities, linguistics, lexicography,&nbsp;lexicology, literary criticism, and poetics, the paper&nbsp;will address the conference theme of “Access” in the&nbsp;sense of tapping into knowledge that has previously&nbsp;been inaccessible.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Context</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is widely considered to be the greatest philological and&nbsp;lexicographical achievement in English. As the first&nbsp;fascicles of the OED were being prepared, editor James&nbsp;Murray professed his dedication to “The perfection of&nbsp;the Dictionary in its data” (1880: 129, orig. emph.). The&nbsp;“data” of the work is its 2.43 million quotations, a&nbsp;significant portion of them from poetic and other&nbsp;literary texts, which both shape and illustrate the&nbsp;various sense definitions of roughly 600,000 English&nbsp;words and word forms. Conversely, since its&nbsp;publication, poets have relied on the OED to guide&nbsp;their deployments and arrangements of English words&nbsp;in poems. This reciprocal intertextuality has led to two&nbsp;striking facts which have yet to be fully explored: 1)&nbsp;that the OED’s definitions of English words depend to&nbsp;a significant degree on poetic language, which is&nbsp;striking because by any standard account, poetic usage&nbsp;tends away from the denotative or definitional and&nbsp;towards the connotative and metaphorical; and 2) that&nbsp;much English poetry of the last hundred years&nbsp;contains a philological, etymological, and&nbsp;lexicographical dimension, informed by the OED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although the Second Edition of the OED (Murray et al., 1989) was among the first large reference works to&nbsp;be prepared for public and academic communities in&nbsp;digitized, marked-up form, and despite the current&nbsp;and ongoing revision of the dictionary (Simpson et. al.,&nbsp;2000-), no version has ever been marked-up with&nbsp;additional metadata. Information we might expect to&nbsp;find in a modern text dataset, such as author gender,&nbsp;genre of quotation, and type of publication, is not&nbsp;included in the OED. Attempts to incorporate such&nbsp;information into studies of linguistic, literary and&nbsp;cultural questions have until now have therefore been&nbsp;limited to “case-study” or “sampling” methodologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Life of Words: Poetry and the OED” addresses this by working directly with legacy versions of the&nbsp;electronic OED, enhancing these with appropriate&nbsp;metadata about the quotation evidence. With the&nbsp;enhanced dataset, alongside modern large text&nbsp;corpora, we then generate quantitative and qualitative&nbsp;assessments in two broad fields of inquiry: 1) What&nbsp;has been the influence of poetry on the English&nbsp;language’s most comprehensive lexicographical work?&nbsp;and 2) What influence has the OED had on English-language poetry? To take a modern turn on Murray,&nbsp;our concern now is the perfection of the dictionary in&nbsp;its data, metadata, and comparative data.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Paper Outline</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The preamble to this paper will briefly introduce the project, discussing its background, methods&nbsp;employed, and current stage of development, and&nbsp;offering some observations regarding the use of&nbsp;dictionaries in general, the OED in particular, and&nbsp;specifically the “opened-up”, marked-up and directly&nbsp;accessible enhanced OED, as “evidence” for&nbsp;interpretation in a number of scholarly domains, a&nbsp;methodological topic which has received recent&nbsp;attention in dictionary studies, literary studies, and&nbsp;linguistics (e.g. Coleman 2013a, 2013b; Coleman and&nbsp;Ogilvie 2009; Hoffman 2004). The bulk of the&nbsp;presentation will be devoted to an exploration of the&nbsp;enhanced OED, demonstrating some top-level findings&nbsp;relevant to current scholarship in three fields. In the&nbsp;history of lexicography, recently there has been much&nbsp;discussion on the interpretation of OED quotation&nbsp;evidence as a complex indicator of both the prestige of&nbsp;certain kinds of writing over time, and the particular&nbsp;judgements, biases, and practices of the nineteenth-century philologists who compiled the First Edition&nbsp;(1884-1928) (Ogilvie 2013; Brewer 2012, 2010, 2009,&nbsp;2007; Considine 2009; Mugglestone 2005, 2000;&nbsp;Willinsky 1994). In the first main part of the paper, I&nbsp;give an overall quantitative assessment of the generic&nbsp;make-up of OED quotations, comparing the First and&nbsp;Second Editions, and discuss the implications of this&nbsp;for literary and for cultural history. Next, at the&nbsp;intersection of lexicology and literary studies, I offer a&nbsp;re-assessment of claims surrounding the linguistic&nbsp;inventiveness of canonical authors such as&nbsp;Shakespeare and Milton (Goodland 2011, 2010;&nbsp;Brewer 2013, Crystal 2000; Gray 1989; Schafer 1980)&nbsp;based on benchmarks for the period and genre of their&nbsp;various works. Finally, in the realm of literary&nbsp;criticism, I demonstrate a number of ways that&nbsp;information embedded in the OED can be harnessed to&nbsp;detect literary tropes such as allusion and&nbsp;etymological wordplay, either in poems that have been&nbsp;directly influenced by the OED, and those for which the&nbsp;evidence is less conclusive.</span></p>
