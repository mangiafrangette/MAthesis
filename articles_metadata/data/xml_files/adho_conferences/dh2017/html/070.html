<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“A Trace of this Journey”: Citations of Digitised&nbsp;Newspapers in UK History&nbsp;PhD Theses</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“In two weeks, despite these notes, I shall no longer believe in what I am experiencing now.&nbsp;One must leave behind a trace of this journey&nbsp;which memory forgets” (Cocteau, 2013).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Academic citations are prostheses for the scholarly memory, providing traces of a text's origins. They are&nbsp;also, taken collectively, a powerful source of information on scholarly influence, links between authors,&nbsp;and academic publishing trends. This paper will present work in progress to discover the extent to which&nbsp;citation patterns by UK historians have been affected&nbsp;by digitisation of historical newspapers. Previous studies into digital resources have used citation analysis for&nbsp;impact analysis (Meyer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2009), but faced problems gathering accurate data due to researchers' unwillingness to cite digital resources. Text mining mentions of titles within a digital resource offers a solution&nbsp;to this problem; indeed, Milligan (2013) has successfully used techniques from Natural Language Processing to track citations of major Canadian newspapers in Canadian PhD theses. However, there are local&nbsp;variations around academic practice, and cultural heritage digitisation, and to date there has been no largescale study of digital resource citations in the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper will present my efforts to mine newspaper citation trends using over 6,000 history theses submitted at UK Higher Education institutions, from 1999 to 2015. It will also consider the implications of text&nbsp;mining using legal deposit library collections. Its significance is therefore twofold. It is the first study to use&nbsp;text mining to track citations in UK history theses,&nbsp;thereby providing insights into the effect of local digitised primary sources. Second, by collaborating with&nbsp;British Library Labs, it provides an important test case&nbsp;of the possibility of exploring the text mining exception&nbsp;in UK copyright law. This study therefore focuses on&nbsp;two key research questions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">What does citation analysis of UK history theses tell us about the impact of historic newspaper</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">digitisation on early career historians in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font3">How far does the ability to text and data mine copyrighted materials provide for data driven&nbsp;approaches when applied to legal deposit library collections?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Research context</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the last fifteen years several studies have proposed models for evaluating the impact of digital resources (Warwick </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2006; Meyer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2009; Tanner, 2012). Citation analysis is commonly used in&nbsp;impact evaluation, and is a well-established biblio-metric technique for impact analysis (MacRoberts&nbsp;and MacRoberts, 1989). As part of the wider field of&nbsp;bibliometrics, citation analysis has been used to&nbsp;judge the impact of academic publications and digital resources (Meyer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font3">, 2009). Citations are proxy&nbsp;measures of how frequently a document or resource&nbsp;is used, founded on the assumption that there is a&nbsp;strong positive correlation between the number of&nbsp;citations that a resource or article attracts, and the&nbsp;quality of that resource (Smith, 1980). The reality,&nbsp;though, is that citation practices are not always followed or understood by academics. Smith (1980)&nbsp;noted several reasons a scholar may choose not to&nbsp;cite a document: inability to obtain the document; inability to read a foreign language; lack of relevance&nbsp;to their work; or lack of awareness of existing work.&nbsp;There are further reasons for digital resources; not&nbsp;least a lack of awareness of how to cite them (Su-kovic, 2009), and disciplinary unwillingness to&nbsp;acknowledge their usage (Meyer, 2009). As a result,&nbsp;the traditional method of mining only citations provide an unreliable picture of citation levels of digital&nbsp;resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, there is a need to account for the varied local and national context within which researchers operate. In Canada, for instance, there is a&nbsp;feeling among scholars that the “limited and fragmented” (Kheraj, 2014) newspaper digitisation programme lags behind nations such as the USA, Australia and United Kingdom. The prominence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Toronto Star</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Globe and Mail</span><span class="font3"> mirrors the&nbsp;early years of newspaper digitisation in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, where the ubiquity of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times Digital&nbsp;Archive</span><span class="font3"> encouraged some to overstate its repre</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sentativeness (Bingham, 2010). Contemporary digitised newspaper resources in the UK by contrast, tend to aggregate dozens of newspaper titles into a&nbsp;single resource. This paper therefore explores the&nbsp;likelihood that this aggregation process may have&nbsp;caused different citation patterns among UK re</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">searchers, who are the largest group to access these resources (Gooding, 2014), providing a comparison</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">with the differing Canadian context presented by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Milligan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Methodology</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To achieve this, I will focus on newspaper titles</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">from two British Library resources: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">British Library Nineteenth Century Newspapers</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> (BNCN)</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">The British&nbsp;Newspaper Archive</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> (BNA).</span><span class="font3"> I intend to identify mentions&nbsp;of newspapers by title within the full text of UK history&nbsp;theses. The dataset comes from </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">EThOS</span><span class="font3">, a national service which makes UK doctoral theses available online&nbsp;for searching and reading. EThOS contains approximately 440,000 records relating to theses awarded by&nbsp;over 120 institutions. It provides a comprehensive, systematically collected dataset for comparison of citation&nbsp;trends over time. Around 160,000 records provide access to searchable full text, and I have worked with&nbsp;British Library Labs to identify a subset of history theses published from 1999 to 2015; in total, over 6,000&nbsp;theses were identified using Dewey Decimal Classifiers,&nbsp;covering eight years before and after the launch of&nbsp;BNCN in 2007. These theses will be searched using Natural Language Processing techniques to identify the incidence of specific newspaper titles that are included in&nbsp;BNCN and BNA, allowing me to identify how many theses use a given source, and how frequently each source&nbsp;was used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This project also acts as a test case for text mining of British Library collections. In 2014, the UK government introduced an exception to copyright law to ensure that researchers undertaking text and data-min-ing for non-commercial purposes would no longer infringe copyright (Intellectual Property Office, 2014),&nbsp;without requiring that publishers took steps to guarantee the availability of suitable datasets for text mining.&nbsp;In reality, this means that there are many potentially&nbsp;valuable data sources that could be legally studied, but&nbsp;no infrastructure to do so. Starting with the British Library's PhD thesis holdings, I intend to work with British Library Labs to explore the possibility of opening up&nbsp;further datasets for text mining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This paper will explore the ways in which historical newspaper digitisation have impacted upon historiography among early career researchers in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, by tracking citations of digitised newspaper&nbsp;titles over time in the full text of over 6,000 PhD theses.&nbsp;This is the first study to apply text mining of digital resource citations to the UK context. It also provides an&nbsp;important case study of text and data mining in legal&nbsp;deposit library collections, in the light of current limitations to the UK copyright exception. In doing so, this&nbsp;project will not only illuminate the ways in which digital resources can affect local research practices, but will&nbsp;demonstrate the utility of text mining in addressing the&nbsp;methodological limitations of citation analysis for digital resources. We must adopt new computational methods to ensure that the traces of this use are not wiped&nbsp;away by citation practices which continue to de-em-phasise the role of digital resources in contemporary&nbsp;research.</span></p>
