    <p>This poster addresses some of the practical problems of working with the underlying
digital files prepared by the Early English Books Online-Text Creation Partnership
(EEBO-TCP) using generalized tools developed for used with files following 
the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).<ref type="note" target="n01" n="1">1</ref> This conversion work, at the
University of Oxford, was initially driven by a desire to experiment with the creation of
truly usable ePub editions of the Eighteenth Century Collections Online - Text Creation
Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus released into the public domain in 2010. It was
undertaken at the University of Oxford's IT Services independently of the EEBO-TCP
team at the Bodleian Library or in Michigan.</p>
    <p>The Text Creation Partnership (TCP) digitization programme is a large and complex
operation, with very detailed guidance and standards (<ref type="url" target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/">http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/</ref>) worked out over the  last decade. 
When the project started the decision was made to use SGML markup as the archival storage
format, and a variation on the TEI Guidelines, version P3, for the encoding vocabulary.
Unfortunately, SGML-aware software is increasingly hard to come by, and the
advantages of doing this kind of work in XML these day are self-evident. The TEI has
also developed significantly since TEI P3, with the current TEI P5 releases making many
changes and improvements (some of them owing to proposals arising from work
rationalizing the TCP markup). Interchange or comparison with other TEI texts, or use
of TEI-aware software, suggests that we should have a way to transform the TCP texts
into valid TEI P5 XML. This does not mean that once texts are in TEI that they are
inherently interoperable, at least not without some effort, but this should be a vastly
simpler task with a converted version of the EEBO-TCP corpus because they have all
been created by a single project following a single set of encoding guidelines. These TCP
guidelines have been developed over the course of the project and while not always
perfect have gradually been increasing in standards of consistency.</p>
    <p>The transformation of these EEBO-TCP texts to a basic and conventional web site
 alongside the facsimile page images is generally a straightforward task. However, if we
want to take advantage of some of the tools now commonly used to process digital files, particularly those based on the current TEI 
P5 recommendations, this is much more problematic. At very least this involves transforming the SGML markup to XML, and
then to the latest edition of the TEI (TEI P5). This poster will document these stages in
conversion with examples of some of the problems encountered in this sort of
conversion. This has sometimes necessitated changes to the TEI Guidelines themselves
in order to be able to consistently encode textual phenomena that has been identified by
the TCP project which cannot adequately be described using the current TEI
recommendations. In other cases, decisions have needed to be made in the appropriate
way to map some of the encoding variants adopted by EEBO-TCP back onto the existing
and TEI P5 markup guidelines.</p>
    <p>As well as the process, this poster presents some of the software that we have developed
for converting ECCO-TCP and EEBO-TCP files. The exercise of transformation gives an
interesting opportunity to examine the nature of the encoding of TCP texts, analyze the
range of textual phenomena which are recorded in the corpus, and predict which
structures which will be amenable to discovery by future scholars. The approximately
40000-text corpus of TCP also provides a good testbed for the more generalized TEI
tools that we have developed. For this poster we describe some of the tools that we've
used for the TCP conversions and the results of analysis of the converted TCP texts. As a
case study we examine and demonstrate the generation of ebook editions (ePub format)
of the ECCO-TCP and EEBO-TCP texts from the converted TEI. The results of such
conversions will be discussed with regard for their usefulness for contemporary readers
and any failures in representing the intellectual content of the original text.</p>

<note xml:id="n01" n="1">Significant thanks are owed to Paul Schaffner for his very patient and understanding help
in explaining decisions made by the TCP project. We are also grateful to Martin Mueller,
Stephen Ramsay and Brian Pytlik Zillig of the Monk and Abbott projects, who wrestled with
some of the same dilemmas before and in parallel with us, for discussions of minutiae of the
markup. See <ref type="url" target="http://www.tei-c.org/">http://www.tei-c.org/</ref> for more information about the TEI.</note>
