Selection of these perceptual enhancement filters can significantly improve the user's ability to interactively inspect the content of 2D RTI media by zooming, panning, and changing the illumination direction. In particular, we present two groups of strategies for RTI image enhancement based on two main ideas: exploiting the unsharp masking methodology in the RTI-specific context; and locally optimizing the incident light direction for improved RTI image sharpness and illumination of surface features. The Result section will present a number of datasets and compare them with existing techniques.", "article_title": "Dynamic shading enhancement for reflectance transformation imaging", "authors": [{"given": "Gianpaolo", "family": "Palma", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Pisa", "normalized_name": "University of Pisa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03ad39j10", "GRID": "grid.5395.a"}}, {"original_name": "ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "normalized_name": "Institute of Information Science and Technologies", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05kacka20", "GRID": "grid.451498.5"}}]}, {"given": "Massimiliano", "family": "Corsini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "normalized_name": "Institute of Information Science and Technologies", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05kacka20", "GRID": "grid.451498.5"}}]}, {"given": "Paolo", "family": "Cignoni", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "normalized_name": "Institute of Information Science and Technologies", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05kacka20", "GRID": "grid.451498.5"}}]}, {"given": "Roberto", "family": "Scopigno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy", "normalized_name": "Institute of Information Science and Technologies", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05kacka20", "GRID": "grid.451498.5"}}]}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Mudge", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cultural Heritage Imaging (CHI), San Fransisco, CA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2010-10-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
