We advocate open repositories of scientifically authenticated 3D models based on the example of traditional scholarly journals, with standard mechanisms for preservation, peer review, publication, updating, and dissemination of the 3D models. However, fully realizing this vision will require addressing a number of related research challenges.In this article, we first give a brief background of the virtual heritage discipline, and characterize the need for centralized 3D archives, including a preliminary needs assessment survey of virtual heritage practitioners. Then we describe several existing 3D cultural heritage repositories, and enumerate a number of technical research challenges that should be addressed to realize an ideal archive. These challenges include digital rights management for the 3D models, clear depiction of uncertainty in 3D reconstructions, version control for 3D models, effective metadata structures, long-term preservation, interoperability, and 3D searching. Other concerns are provision for the application of computational analysis tools, and the organizational structure of a peer-reviewed 3D model archive.", "article_title": "Research challenges for digital archives of 3D cultural heritage models", "authors": [{"given": "David", "family": "Koller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": "Bernard", "family": "Frischer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": "Greg", "family": "Humphreys", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2010-01-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "2", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
