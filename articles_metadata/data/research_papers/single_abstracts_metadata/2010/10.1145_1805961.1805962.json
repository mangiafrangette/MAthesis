In order to establish a coherent taxonomy, specific elements characterizing such approaches will be discussed and employed to assist the definition of a general conceptual framework that will enable the classification of the possible design choices according to their specific characteristics. Finally, a selection of modeling and simulation techniques which are specifically related to the creation process underlying the virtual representation of heritage items by means of modern visualization technologies will be explored alongside the main areas of preferences linked to the major actors active in the cultural heritage field.", "article_title": "A taxonomy of visualization strategies for cultural heritage applications", "authors": [{"given": "Alessandro E.", "family": "Foni", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Geneva", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01swzsf04", "GRID": "grid.8591.5"}}]}, {"given": "George", "family": "Papagiannakis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Geneva", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01swzsf04", "GRID": "grid.8591.5"}}]}, {"given": "Nadia", "family": "Magnenat-Thalmann", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Geneva", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01swzsf04", "GRID": "grid.8591.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2010-06-30", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
