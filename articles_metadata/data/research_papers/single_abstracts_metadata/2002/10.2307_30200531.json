Drawing on contemporary performance theory, literary criticism, and communication theory, the author proposes that technologists, academics, and artists are developing idiomatic rhetorics - a lingua franca - to explore the technical and expressive properties of the new \"language machines\" and their hypertextual environments. The role of improvisation - and its cross-disciplinary protocols - provides a further focus in the discussion of computing practice and performance.", "article_title": "Animating the Language Machine: Computers and Performance", "authors": [{"given": "Marshall", "family": "Soules", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Malaspina University-College", "normalized_name": "Vancouver Island University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/033wcvv61", "GRID": "grid.267756.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2002-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "36", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
