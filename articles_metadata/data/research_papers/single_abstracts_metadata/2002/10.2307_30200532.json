In this paper a brief history of computer games is presented as a starting point for developing a topology of games and a theory of computer games as rhetorical artifacts suitable for critical study. The paper addresses the question of why games should be treated seriously and suggests a theoretical approach based on Bakhtin's poetics of the novel where the experience of time and space (the chronotope) provides a framework of questions for discussing computer games.", "article_title": "Gore Galore: Literary Theory and Computer Games", "authors": [{"given": "Geoffrey", "family": "Rockwell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humanities Computing Centre, McMaster University", "normalized_name": "McMaster University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02fa3aq29", "GRID": "grid.25073.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2002-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "36", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
