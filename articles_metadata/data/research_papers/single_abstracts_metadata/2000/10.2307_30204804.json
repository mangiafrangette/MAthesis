The most likely sense tag for a word is determined by calculating co-occurrence statistics for words appearing within a small window. This paper gives a brief description of the components in the Wisdom system and the algorithm used to predict the correct sense tag. Some results for Wisdom from the Senseval competition are presented, and directions for future work are also explored.", "article_title": "Simple Word Sense Discrimination: Towards Reduced Complexity", "authors": [{"given": "Keith", "family": "Suderman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Manitoba", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02gfys938", "GRID": "grid.21613.37"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
