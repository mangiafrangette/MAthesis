Drawing on Judith Butler and others' work on the \"politics of grief,\" I consider how Thomas Hoccleve uses his experience of personal loss and sorrow as an occasion to reflect on the precarious lives of those around him. In so doing, his work in the Regiment of Princes serves as an early example of how personal sorrow can become an imaginative catalyst for broader ethical reflection and advocacy", "article_title": "The Politics of Precarious Grief in Thomas Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes", "authors": [{"given": "Sarah", "family": "Wilson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Northwestern University", "normalized_name": "Northwestern University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/000e0be47", "GRID": "grid.16753.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2020-05-10", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
