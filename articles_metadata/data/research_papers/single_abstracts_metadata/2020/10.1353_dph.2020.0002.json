I will argue that beneath these layers of misreading, Petrus organizes a collection that emphasizes the subject position of the socially vulnerable: women, pilgrims, travelers, subordinates, apprentices, slaves, and the disabled. In this reading, the normative values of church and state become accruals. Beneath them, I reveal a Disciplina clericalis that it is strangely resonant in our time. It attends to the problem of premodern precarity, recurrently mapping that condition onto body in the form of vulnerability. Disciplina clericalis is less a handbook for preachers or a mirror for princes than a guide for the marginalized in a dangerous and exploitative world.", "article_title": "Sociality at the Margins in Petrus Alfonsi's Disciplina Clericalis", "authors": [{"given": "Gabriel", "family": "Ford", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Converse College", "normalized_name": "Converse College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01g0q1j14", "GRID": "grid.421523.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2020-05-10", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
