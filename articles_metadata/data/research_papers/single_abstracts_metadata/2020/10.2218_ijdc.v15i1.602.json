In this article, I propose a model of the process of trust development at restricted data repositories, a model which emphasizes the increasing levels of trust dependent on prior interactions between repositories and users. I find that repositories develop trust in their users through the interactions of four dimensions – promissory, experience, competence, and goodwill – that consider distinct types of researcher expertise and the role of a researcher’s reputation in the trust process. However, the processes used by repositories to determine a level of trust corresponding to data access are inconsistent and do not support the sharing of trusted users between repositories to maximize efficient yet secure access to restricted research data. I highlight the role of a researcher’s reputation as an important factor in trust development and trust transference, and discuss the implications of modelling the restricted data access process as a process of trust development.
