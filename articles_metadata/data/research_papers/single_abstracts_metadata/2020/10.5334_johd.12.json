Since traditional language comparison within the framework of the comparative method is largely based on manual data comparison, requiring the meticulous sifting through dictionaries, word lists, and grammars, the framework is difficult to apply, especially in times where more and more data have become available in digital form. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply automate the process of historical language comparison, not only because computational solutions lag behind human judgments in historical linguistics, but also because they lack the flexibility that would allow them to integrate various types of information from various kinds of sources. A more promising approach is to integrate computational and classical approaches within a computer-assisted framework, “neither completely computer-driven nor ignorant of the assistance computers afford” [1, p. 4]. In this paper, we will illustrate what we consider the current state of the art of computer-assisted language comparison by presenting a workflow that starts with raw data and leads up to a stage where sound correspondence patterns across multiple languages have been identified and can be readily presented, inspected, and discussed. We illustrate this workflow with the help of a newly prepared dataset on Hmong-Mien languages. Our illustration is accompanied by Python code and instructions on how to use additional web-based tools we developed so that users can apply our workflow for their own purposes.", "article_title": "Computer-Assisted Language Comparison: State of the Art", "authors": [{"given": "Mei-Shin", "family": "Wu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, DE", "normalized_name": "Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05mjrzy91", "GRID": "grid.469873.7"}}]}, {"given": "Nathanael E.", "family": "Schweikhard,", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, DE", "normalized_name": "Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05mjrzy91", "GRID": "grid.469873.7"}}]}, {"given": "Timotheus A.", "family": "Bodt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SOAS, University of London, London, GB", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Nathan W.", "family": "Hill", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SOAS, University of London, London, GB", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Johann-Mattis", "family": "List", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, DE", "normalized_name": "Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05mjrzy91", "GRID": "grid.469873.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Ubiquity Press", "date": "2020-05-22", "keywords": ["computer-assisted", "language comparison", "historical linguistics", "Hmong-Mien language family"], "journal_title": "Journal of Open Humanities Data", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2059-481X", "type": "electronic"}]}
