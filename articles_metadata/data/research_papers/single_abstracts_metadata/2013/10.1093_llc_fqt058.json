We propose a novel method, which generates links across databases using Linked Data. A retrieval system has been developed for realizing the proposed method, which dynamically creates links to miscellaneous Linked Data resources from authority data. By using the proposed method, users would allowed to access to additional data about a certain record in multiple databases not depending on languages and formats of each database. Experimental evaluations have conducted to measure reliability of the generated links. The experimental results show high accuracy rate and prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Links to major Linked Data resources were created successfully.", "article_title": "Linked data driven multilingual access to diverse Japanese Ukiyo-e databases by generating links dynamically", "authors": [{"given": " Biligsaikhan", "family": "Batjargal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Kinugasa Research Organization, Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": " Takeo", "family": "Kuyama", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": " Fuminori", "family": "Kimura", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Kinugasa Research Organization, Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}, {"given": " Akira", "family": "Maeda", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Ritsumeikan University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0197nmd03", "GRID": "grid.262576.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013-09-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
