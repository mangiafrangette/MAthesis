In the literature in question, several claims regarding the nature of this relation can be found that identify certain semantic properties with spatial distribution patterns. These assumptions are the result of observations the authors made through the qualitative study of their data. Whether these findings can be substantiated in a quantitative analysis, however, has not yet been tested. Neither has a systematic explanatory framework that accounts for these postulated relations been devised. This article investigates these issues by using methods from geostatistical dialectometry that allow certain distributional characteristics of linguistic variables to be quantified. The indices obtained in this way are then tested against the relevance of subject areas. Building on the results, an explanatory framework for their interpretation with respect to basic mechanisms of language variation and change in space is introduced.", "article_title": "Lexical meaning and spatial distribution.
