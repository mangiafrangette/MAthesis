Numerous studies have addressed questions pertaining to the history of aura in general, but none have focused on the matter of aura specifically as a rhyme. Within this narrower focus, the history of the aura-rhyme is shown to center on one critical moment, in which the aura-pun in Ovid's Metamorphoses is transformed into the aura-rhyme in Arnaut Daniel's song \"En cest sonet.\" Through a comparative reading of these two texts, conclusions are drawn regarding the relation of puns to rhymes, nouns to names, and the problems of isolating the origin of a rhyme historically.", "article_title": "The Metamorphoses of Aura in Ovid and Arnaut Daniel", "authors": [{"given": "Andrew", "family": "Lemons", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Princeton University", "normalized_name": "Princeton University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hx57361", "GRID": "grid.16750.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013-06-30", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
