It thus constitutes a new approach to the creative process of filmmaking. Musicians, and also choreographers, have long been able to express their creative choices using logical symbolic structures (music notation and dance notation), yet those working in the movie industry have to rely on cartoons and verbal description. Development of a successful notation becomes appropriate today because of its dependence upon the parallel development of effective notation-based software tools such as visualisation (automatic animated storyboard generation), production budget estimation, and automated rough editing of dailies. Directors maintain complete control of their creative decisions when using DN. It is an artistic language supported by technical tools for planning and analysis. The notation is not merely a graphical user interface for these tools, and the tools are never intended to make decisions for the director. This article introduces DN, argues its great cultural significance, provides market research results showing directors' interest in using it, and reports on two controlled experiments confirming its effectivenessâ€”including its usability in a practical context and its ability to represent and communicate the necessary information.", "article_title": "DirectorNotation", "authors": [{"given": "Angelos", "family": "Yannopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": "National Technical University of Athens", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03cx6bg69", "GRID": "grid.4241.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2013-04-09", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
