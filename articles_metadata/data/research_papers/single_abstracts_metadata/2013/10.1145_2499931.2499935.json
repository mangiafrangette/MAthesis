A large scanning campaign can produce billions of point samplesâ€”too many to be manipulated in memory on most computers. It is thus necessary to spatially partition the data so that it can be processed in bins or slices. We introduce a novel compression mechanism that exploits spatial coherence in the data to allow the bins to be computed with only 1.01 bytes of I/O traffic for each byte of input, compared to 2 or more for previous schemes. Additionally, the bins are loaded from the original files for processing rather than from a sorted copy, thus minimizing disk space requirements. We demonstrate that our method yields performance improvements in a typical point-processing task, while also using little memory and guaranteeing an upper bound on the number of samples held in-core.", "article_title": "Fast in-place binning of laser range-scanned point sets", "authors": [{"given": "Bruce", "family": "Merry", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Cape Town and Centre for High Performance Computing, Rondebosch, South Africa", "normalized_name": "University of Cape Town", "country": "South Africa", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03p74gp79", "GRID": "grid.7836.a"}}]}, {"given": "James", "family": "Gain", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Cape Town and Centre for High Performance Computing, Rondebosch, South Africa", "normalized_name": "University of Cape Town", "country": "South Africa", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03p74gp79", "GRID": "grid.7836.a"}}]}, {"given": "Patrick", "family": "Marais", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Cape Town and Centre for High Performance Computing, Rondebosch, South Africa", "normalized_name": "University of Cape Town", "country": "South Africa", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03p74gp79", "GRID": "grid.7836.a"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2013-08-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "6", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
