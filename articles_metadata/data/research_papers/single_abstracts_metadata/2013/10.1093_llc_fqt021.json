Unlike standard lexical and character-level features, it operates at a discourse (cross-sentence) level. We test it against and in combination with standard features on nineteen book-length texts by nine nineteenth-century authors. We find that coherence alone performs often as well as and sometimes better than standard features, though a combination of the two has the highest performance overall. We observe that despite the difference in levels, there is a correlation in performance of the two kinds of features.", "article_title": "Patterns of local discourse coherence as a feature for authorship attribution", "authors": [{"given": " Vanessa Wei", "family": "Feng", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Toronto, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}, {"given": " Graeme", "family": "Hirst", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Toronto, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013-04-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
