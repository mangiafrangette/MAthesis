The categories used in this study are: accessibility, scale, media, hypertext, updates, and iterative research and transparency. Not all of these categories apply equally to any given publication, and the discussion focuses on those that are the most appropriate to a digital publication of tagged epigraphic texts and images.", "article_title": "The Inscriptions of Aphrodisias as electronic publication: A user's perspective and a proposed paradigm", "authors": [{"given": "Gabriel", "family": "Bodard", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-05-31", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "4", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.19"}
