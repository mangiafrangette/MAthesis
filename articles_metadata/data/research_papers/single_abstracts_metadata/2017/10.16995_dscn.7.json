In turning to earlier textual exemplars, such as the sammelbände and foldout engravings, the chapter illustrates certain commonalities between past and present textual media. Similarly, by examining the material evidence of Renaissance readers, including manuscript tables of contents and supplements to print indexes, the chapter considers the long history of customization that lies behind many of our digital applications today. In short, the chapter invites readers to situate a series of INKE tools within a much earlier and seemingly unrelated textual tradition.", "article_title": "Chapter 11Designed for the digital reader: The textual traditions in, of, and behind NewRadial, the dynamic table of contexts and Bubblelines", "authors": [{"given": "Scott", "family": "Schofield", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Huron University College", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "INKE", "family": "Research Group", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-10-19", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "6", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
