This article focuses on TANâ€™s innovative intertextual pointers, which, I argue, provide an unprecedented level of readability, interoperability, and semantic context. Because TAN is a new, experimental format, this article provides a brief introduction to the format and concludes with comments on progress and future prospects.", "article_title": "Intertextual Pointers in the Text Alignment Network", "authors": [{"given": "Joel", "family": "Kalvesmaki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "DO - Dumbarton Oaks", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2017-10-20", "keywords": ["alignment", " TEI", "XML", " TAN", " intertextuality", " canonical references"], "journal_title": "Journal of Data Mining & Digital Humanities", "volume": "Special Issue on Computer-Aided Processing of Intertextuality in Ancient Languages", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
