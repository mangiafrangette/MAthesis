{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " This paper discusses a digital humanities collection called Contemporary Telepathics housed within a larger archive, The Fabric of Digital Life. We argue that through a variety of multimedia representations, the rhetoric of contemporary telepathic devices invokes sublime predictive visions that become instantiated in popular media, news organizations, and disclosures of technology advancement. We discuss the theoretical grounds for a collection of technological forecasts, at a time when they are largely considered ephemera. We also discuss how tracking the telepathic sublime as a dynamically evolving popular communication phenomenon requires a unique, humanities-based metadata scheme and archival practice.
