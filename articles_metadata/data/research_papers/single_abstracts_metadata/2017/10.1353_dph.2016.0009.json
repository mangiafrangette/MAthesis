Inspired by the work of Suzanne Briet (1894–1989), it argues in favor of a culturally informed “documentation” that considers not only the complexity of medieval manuscripts as information objects, but also anticipates the diverse interests of users who depend on digital images and supporting metadata to access manuscripts as primary sources for research. Presented here is a faceted metadata structure that considers the premodern manuscript as physical, textual, historical, as well as digital information. This approach is built upon various traditions for cataloging medieval manuscripts, from Cassiodorus in the sixth century to the electronic databases and digital catalogs of the present.", "article_title": "Cataloging Medieval Manuscripts, from Beasts to Bytes", "authors": [{"given": "Debra Taylor", "family": "Cashion", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Saint Louis University", "normalized_name": "Saint Louis University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01p7jjy08", "GRID": "grid.262962.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2017-01-22", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "5", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
