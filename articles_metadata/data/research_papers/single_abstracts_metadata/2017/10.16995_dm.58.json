This article is an introduction to one of the new functions of the online Anglo-Norman dictionary, i.e. cross-referencing, the provision of links from the Anglo-Norman dictionary entries to other relevant medieval and modern dictionaries. In addition to establishing the usefulness of cross-referencing for dictionary users and presenting how this has been achieved in the Anglo-Norman dictionary, this article examines some of the potential pitfalls that need to be addressed when implementing live links to other dictionaries.", "article_title": "From \"anhelitus\" to \"hanellissement:\" Cross-referencing in the Anglo-Norman dictionary", "authors": [{"given": "Katariina", "family": "Nara-Zanotti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Anglo-Norman dictionary, Aberystwyth University United Kingdom", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-05-31", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "10", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.58"}
