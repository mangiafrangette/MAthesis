T. P. Byles: those that identify Christine as author and those that remove the female author figure from the text. The article also provides a fuller description of the manuscripts than has hitherto been published and elaborates on the differences noted by Byles between the two major groups, with a view to aiding the selection of manuscripts for a critical edition of this text. Finally, the article suggests a new possible motive behind the initial erasure of Christine's authorship, which affected a large number of manuscripts.", "article_title": "The Manuscripts of the Livre des fais d'armes et de chevalerie", "authors": [{"given": "Christine", "family": "Reno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Vassar College", "normalized_name": "Vassar College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/022x6qg61", "GRID": "grid.267778.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2017-06-25", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
