The encomium, composed between 1488 and 1498, praises Anne for serving as regent for her brother, the future King Charles VIII. Citing her many attributes, the poet likens Anne's eloquence to that of Christine de Pizan. How and why he makes this comparison is the subject of this two-part article. I conclude that it is not by accident that the encomium poet added his compliment to Anne to Fran√ßais 24392.", "article_title": "Remembering Christine de Pizan in Paris, BnF, MS fr. 24392, A Manuscript Owned by Anne de France, Duchess of Bourbon", "authors": [{"given": "Lori J.", "family": "Walters", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Florida State University", "normalized_name": "Florida State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05g3dte14", "GRID": "grid.255986.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2017-06-25", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
