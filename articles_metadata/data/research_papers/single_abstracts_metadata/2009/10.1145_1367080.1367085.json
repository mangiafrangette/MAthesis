Interest in the semantic Web has revived the dream, but many are sceptical. This article offers a breakthrough to problems of semantic interoperability and defends the feasibility of a global knowledge network against traditional counterarguments. It offers a new approach based on (i) interdisciplinary research of scholarly and scientific discourse, (ii) a generic global ontological model based on relations and co-reference rather than objects, (iii) semi-automatic maintenance of co-reference links, and (iv) public engagement in the creation and development of the network.", "article_title": "The dream of a global knowledge network—A new approach", "authors": [{"given": "Martin", "family": "Doerr", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS Forth)", "normalized_name": "Institute of Computer Science", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/003fvp964", "GRID": "grid.425308.8"}}]}, {"given": "Dolores", "family": "Iorizzo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Imperial College, London", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2009-01-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
