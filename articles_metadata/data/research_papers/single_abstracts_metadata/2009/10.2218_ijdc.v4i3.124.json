The paper commences with an overview of the setting for ANDS, before introducing ANDS itself. The paper then structures its discussion of ANDS services for Re-use in terms of the ANDS Data Sharing Verbs: Create, Store, Describe, Identify, Register, Discover, Access and Exploit. For each of the data verbs, a rationale for its importance is provided together with a description of how it is being implemented by ANDS. The paper concludes by arguing for the data verbs approach as a useful way to design and structure flexible services in a heterogenous environment.", "article_title": "Designing for Discovery and Re-Use: the ‘ANDS Data Sharing Verbs’ Approach to Service Decomposition", "authors": [{"given": "Adrian", "family": "Burton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Australian National Data Service", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Andrew", "family": "Treloar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Australian National Data Service", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009-12-07", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
