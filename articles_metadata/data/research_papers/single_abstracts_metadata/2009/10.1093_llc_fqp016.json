A workbench is provided that offers tools for handling TEI documents, TextGridLab, making it easier to annotate, process, search, and persistently store new digitized texts. The digitization and annotation of the Campe dictionary1 serves as a first test bed. The overall framework of TextGrid is very generic and can handle different types of text (literary editions, linguistic corpora, lexica) as well as heterogeneous data formats (plain text, XML/TEI, images). In fact, the TextGrid repository, TextGridRep, is designed as a digital virtual library over federated archives, where humanities projects are invited to participate. Sharing of data is enabled by means of a grid-based architecture. Specifically the middleware includes most of the treatment of authorization, search, and file management. TextGrid is entirely based on open source software including Eclipse2 and Globus Toolkit.", "article_title": "TEI documents in the grid", "authors": [{"given": " Andrea", "family": "Zielinski", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Sprache Mannheim, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Wolfgang", "family": "Pempe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Saphor GmbH, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Peter", "family": "Gietz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "DAASI International GmbH, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Martin", "family": "Haase", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Sprache Mannheim, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009-05-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
