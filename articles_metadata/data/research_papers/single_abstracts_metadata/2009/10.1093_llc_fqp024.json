The majority of corpora is annotated using markup languages that are based on the Annotation Graph framework, the upcoming Linguistic Annotation Format ISO standard, or according to tag sets defined by or based upon the TEI guidelines. A unified representation comprises the separation of conceptually different annotation layers contained in the original corpus data (e.g. syntax, phonology, and semantics) into multiple XML files. These annotation layers are linked to each other implicitly by the identical textual content of all files. A suitable data structure for the representation of these annotations is a multi-rooted tree that again can be represented by the TEI and ISO tag set for feature structures. The mapping process and representational issues are discussed as well as the advantages and drawbacks associated with the use of the TEI tag set for feature structures as a storage and exchange format for linguistically annotated data.", "article_title": "SusTEInability of linguistic resources through feature structures", "authors": [{"given": " Andreas", "family": "Witt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut f체r Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim, Germany", "normalized_name": "Institute for the German Language", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hvwkt50", "GRID": "grid.443960.c"}}]}, {"given": "Georg", "family": "Rehm", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "vionto GmbH, Berlin, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Erhard", "family": "Hinrichs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "T체bingen University, General and Computational Linguistics, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of T체bingen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03a1kwz48", "GRID": "grid.10392.39"}}]}, {"given": " Timm", "family": "Lehmberg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Hamburg University, SFB Multilingualism, Germany", "normalized_name": "Universit채t Hamburg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00g30e956", "GRID": "grid.9026.d"}}]}, {"given": " Jens", "family": "Stegmann", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bielefeld University, Faculty of Linguistics and Literary Studies, Germany", "normalized_name": "Bielefeld University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02hpadn98", "GRID": "grid.7491.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009-06-12", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
