The Project uses the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model and Web 2.0 technology, to visually present standards frameworks for a number of disciplines. The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) is actively working with a different relevant organisations to present searchable frameworks of standards, for a number of domains. These include digital repositories, records management, the geo-information sector, archives and the museum sector. Other domains, such as e-science, will shortly be investigated.", "article_title": "DCC DIFFUSE Standards Frameworks: A Standards Path through the Curation Lifecycle", "authors": [{"given": "Sarah", "family": "Higgins", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Curation Centre", "normalized_name": "Digital Curation Centre", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k9d6864", "GRID": "grid.499933.d"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009-10-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
