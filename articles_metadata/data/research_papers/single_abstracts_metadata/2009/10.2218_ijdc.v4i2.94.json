Data curation and stewardship are essential building blocks in the science community’s quest to better understand how natural climate and weather systems behave and how activities of  human civilization are altering the natural system. Rudimentary observations of the atmosphere and ocean have been collected for over one hundred years and proxity measurements of the climate can trace our planet’s climatic history for  millions of years. These observations coupled with the rapid advances in technology, such as powerful computers, rapid access to massive amounts of data, and satellite observations, have allowed innovative techniques to be used to understand and predict the planet’s climate and weather.", "article_title": "Data Curation in Climate and Weather:  Transforming Our Ability to Improve Predictions through Global Knowledge Sharing", "authors": [{"given": "Clifford A.", "family": "Jacobs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Science Foundation, USA", "normalized_name": "National Science Foundation", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/021nxhr62", "GRID": "grid.431093.c"}}]}, {"given": "Steven J.", "family": "Worley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA", "normalized_name": "National Center for Atmospheric Research", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05cvfcr44", "GRID": "grid.57828.30"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009-10-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
