Its aim is to produce a digital and print edition of the Fine Rolls from the reign of the 13th-century English King Henry III (1216â€“72). At the core of the resource are the translated summaries of the fine rolls which have been encoded in TEI XML, complemented by an overarching RDF/OWL conceptual model and digital facsimiles. In this article, we reflect on the ontological complexities of a dual publication, by bringing together various theoretical frameworks. Our aim is to take inspiration from these theories and connect them to the experience of producing two objects of different materiality but of very close scope. Ultimately, we will also explain how some of these reflections have been used to design a study for evaluating the utility of this edition.", "article_title": "Reflecting on a dual publication: Henry III Fine Rolls print and web", "authors": [{"given": " Arianna", "family": "Ciula", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": " Tamara", "family": "Lopez", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009-05-21", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
