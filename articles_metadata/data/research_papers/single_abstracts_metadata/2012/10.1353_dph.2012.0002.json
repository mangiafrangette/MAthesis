Literary authorship at-tribution, especially, has been a central topic. After a brief introduction, I will discuss the enormous potential of this paradigm for medieval philology, a field that studies so many texts of unknown or disputed origin. At the same time, it will be stressed that stylometry’s application to medieval texts is currently not without problems: many attribution techniques are still controversial and do not account for the specific nature of medieval text production. Throughout this paper, I will tentatively apply two well-established attribution techniques (principal components analysis and Burrows’s Delta) to a number of case studies in Middle Dutch studies. These analyses shall be restricted to rhyme words, since these words are less likely to have been altered by scribes.", "article_title": "Stylometry for Medieval Authorship Studies: An Application to Rhyme Words", "authors": [{"given": "Mike", "family": "Kestemont", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Antwerp", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2012-07-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
