Evaluations of the modeling techniques were performed by carrying out experiments with cultural heritage specialists. The first experiment consisted in evaluating UML class diagrams and a conceptual graph. The second experiment evaluated a value cluster modeling approach. These qualitative evaluations were conducted using focus groups composed of cultural heritage specialists. We evaluated the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, and the intention to use of the three techniques (UML class diagrams, conceptual graphs, and the value cluster approach). Thanks to these evaluations, we will be able to propose a combined approach using value cluster modeling and UML class diagraming techniques to describe cultural heritage information.", "article_title": "Qualitative evaluation of cultural heritage information modeling techniques", "authors": [{"given": "Charlotte", "family": "Hug", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne", "normalized_name": "Pantheon-Sorbonne University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002t25c44", "GRID": "grid.10988.38"}}, {"original_name": "Grenoble University, Paris, France", "normalized_name": "Joseph Fourier University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02aj0kh94", "GRID": "grid.9621.c"}}]}, {"given": "Cesar", "family": "Gonzalez-Perez", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Santiago de Compostela, Spain", "normalized_name": "Spanish National Research Council", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02gfc7t72", "GRID": "grid.4711.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2012-08-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "5", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
