This methodology is here applied to Jean-Marie Dutey’s le mange-texte. The article will provide a reminder of the definition of some concepts and highlight the various effects on the work of the changes in technical contexts of execution. The program is also being studied in a rhetorical dimension. This paper demonstrates that a reading of the screen is not enough to reach all the aesthetic representations of the work and aims to complete it with an operation of meta-reading. We will then analyze the rhetorical level induced by the execution and show why the obsolescence of the work does not mean the death of the work.", "article_title": "Signs and apparatus in digital poetry: The example of Jean-Marie Dutey's le mange-texte", "authors": [{"given": " Philippe", "family": "Bootz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université Paris 8, France", "normalized_name": "Paris 8 University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04wez5e68", "GRID": "grid.15878.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2012-07-19", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "27", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
