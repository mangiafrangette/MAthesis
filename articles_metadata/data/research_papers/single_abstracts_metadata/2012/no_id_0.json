The text corpus edited by the DFG-funded project Deutsches Textarchiv (henceforth: DTA), a large and still growing reference corpus of historical German, is a fine example of such a collection. The following remarks focus on text prepared in a Double-Keying-process, since the major part of the DTA-corpus is compiled by applying this highly accurate method. An extensive and multi-tiered approach, which is currently applied by the DTA for the analysis and correction of errors in double-keyed text, is introduced. The process of quality assurance is pursued in a formative way in order to prevent as many errors as possible, as well as in a summative way in order to track errors which nevertheless may have occurred in the course of full-text digitization. To facilitate the latter, DTAQ, a web-based, collaborative tool for finding and commenting errors in the corpus, was developed. On the profound basis of practical experience in the past four years, the preliminaries and possible methods of conducting a widespread quality assurance are being discussed.", "article_title": "TEI und Textkorpora: Fehlerklassifikation und Qualitätskontrolle vor, während und nach der Texterfassung im Deutschen Textarchiv", "authors": [{"given": "Alexander", "family": "Geyken", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Susanne", "family": "Haaf", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Bryan", "family": "Jurish", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Matthias", "family": "Schulz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Christian", "family": "Thomas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Frank", "family": "Wiegand", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2012-08-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
