As it further expands, the DH needs to critically engage with digital technologies by shifting the balance between the thinking and methods of the humanities. Taking the standpoint of a humanist enterprise, the DH ought to examine materiality as the essence of the digital. In so doing it should engage with the subjective experience as a starting point of analysis about how the digital impacts the nature of who we are, and in turn the way in which it affects culture and digital practices.", "article_title": "A Critical Approach to Digital Humanities: Examining the Subjective Sphere", "authors": [{"given": "Paolo", "family": "Casani", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2018-10-01", "keywords": ["critical digital humanities ", " subjective perspective ", " materiality ", " humanistic approach"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
