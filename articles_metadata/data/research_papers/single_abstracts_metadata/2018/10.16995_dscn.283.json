To this end, we propose to implement upgradeable digital models that include the time dimension. These models are designed to illustrate the evolution of heritage buildings and sites over time and record the historian’s interpretation of documentary sources. The research objective is to develop a 4D modelling protocol to optimize data organization so information is easier to access and modify. This paper explains why BIM platforms do not seem appropriate tools for the work we are doing. We describe our method based on the synergy between a SQLite database and a 3D software (Autodesk Maya) linked by an algorithm written in Python. We conducted a case study involving a heritage place in Montreal, Canada. This site provided an opportunity to test the protocol developed because it is composed of several buildings that have evolved asynchronously.", "article_title": "4D Modelling of Built Heritage: A System Offering an Alternative to Using BIM", "authors": [{"given": "Nathalie", "family": "Charbonneau", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}, {"given": "Nicolas", "family": "Spiric", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}, {"given": "Vanessa", "family": "Blais", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Collège Édouard-Montpetit", "normalized_name": "Cegep Edouard Montpetit", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02es2jq57", "GRID": "grid.420978.0"}}]}, {"given": "Léon", "family": "Robichaud", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Sherbrooke", "normalized_name": "Université de Sherbrooke", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00kybxq39", "GRID": "grid.86715.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Joanne", "family": "Burgess", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2018-09-26", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
