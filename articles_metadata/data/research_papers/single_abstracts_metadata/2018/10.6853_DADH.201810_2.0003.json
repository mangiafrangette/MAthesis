In addition to Sima Qian and Sima Tan, Chu Shaosun is also one of the authors of Shiji. This study used term frequency statistics tool on DocuSky to count 30 chapters of Shiji. Frist, I used virtual words in Shiji as the subject matter doing statistical analysis. And then used the writing of Chu Shaosun as a control group to compare the differences in the word frequency of the three people. And we can use digital methods to prove the similarities and differences between the authors of the Shiji.", "article_title": "Digital Humanities for Authorship Attribution Problem of Shiji: Based on Frequency of Function Words Within the Hereditary Houses Section", "authors": [{"given": "Shih-Wen", "family": "Chyu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2018-10-01", "keywords": ["corpus linguistics ", " textual analysis ", " data visualization ", " early modern English drama "], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
