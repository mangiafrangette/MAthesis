This experimental character can be subsumed under keywords such as multiperspectivity, multidisciplinarity, and trans- or multimediality. These keywords serve as the (re)productive power driving the permanent pursuit of more, which was initiated by the shift in format, with its changing research interests and goals. However, the corresponding medial and material metamorphoses produce the dilemma of a documentary level of detail in the digital edition that requires new strategies for use.
