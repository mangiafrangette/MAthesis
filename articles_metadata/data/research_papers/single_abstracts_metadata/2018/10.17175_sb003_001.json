According to this distinction, a practice in the humanities is digitalized if it is today computer-aided, but already existed previously in non-digitalized form. Digital activites are instead those that have only become possible thanks to new digital methods. In my contribution will argue that the history of science is today facing the challenge of becoming not just digitalized, but digital, if it wished to invesitgate the transformation which took place in science due to digitalities.", "article_title": "Wissenschaftsgeschichte zwischen Digitalität und Digitalisierung", "authors": [{"given": "Arianna", "family": "Borrelli", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Technische Universität Berlin, Institut für Philosophie, Literatur-, Wissenschafts- und Technikgeschichte", "normalized_name": "Technical University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03v4gjf40", "GRID": "grid.6734.6"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2018-06-27", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Sonderband 3", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1366", "type": "electronic"}]}
