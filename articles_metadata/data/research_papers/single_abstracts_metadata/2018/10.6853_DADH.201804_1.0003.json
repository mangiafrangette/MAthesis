Digital humanities has been rooted on the intersection and fusion of digital technology and humanity study. Based on accumulated experiences in interdisciplinary research, this paper depicts computational thinking and attempts to characterize research implications of data computation on humanities study. The abstract implications are manifested by actual research contexts of several domestic case studies, so as to provide reference and contemplation for the collective growth of digital humanities. Essential characteristics of digital humanities research paradigm inferred by the data computation model include: scale, dimension, intelligence, visualization, contextualization, independent validation, and common grounding. These characterization may help establish transdisciplinary pathways for younger generation scholars and provide further consideration with the research community. Transdisciplinary digital humanities research entails both physical changes of collaborative interaction and chemical changes of creative fusion. It is hoped that more will join the endeavor and begin a great journey of new adventure.", "article_title": "Computational Thinking and Implications for Digital Humanities Research", "authors": [{"given": "Jyi-Shane", "family": "Liu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2018-04-01", "keywords": ["  computational thinking ", " data computation ", " digital humanities ", " research implications"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
