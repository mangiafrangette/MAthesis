It describes the origins of objections that seek to deny the necessity of the ›edited text‹, and to frame it solely as a form of supplementary aid for the reader, while simultaneously insisting, with equally great emphasis, on the primacy of the ›edited text‹ as the cornerstone of the edition. In addition, this paper will also explain how modern editions interact with the construction of the ›edited text‹ as well as review the current state of debate in the field.", "article_title": "Der ›edierte‹ Text: Grundpfeiler der Edition oder ›Zugeständnis‹ an den Leser?", "authors": [{"given": "Bodo", "family": "Plachta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2018-03-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Sonderband 2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1366", "type": "electronic"}]}
