Therefore, their mass digitisation and the application of computer-generated analysis can proceed without attracting conspicuous attention. This article focuses not on how the digital humanities change objects and their corresponding analytical methods, but on how they can contribute to the transformation of the journal into an important research object in the first place. I argue that the humanities cannot even conceptualize the journal in its specific multi-dimensionality and that digitisation now offers the chance to compensate for this deficiency.
