This article examines an interdisciplinary project that uses digital cartography to introduce students to concepts in disability studies in order to get them engaged with issues of social justice within their community. The assignment asks students to map the nexus of power relations that they find in their community using digital tools such as ARC GIS and story maps software. This article provides a history of the assignment along with the assignment's framework including the reading list and classroom activities. Story Maps and Disability Studies concludes with a critical reflection on the assignment's educational goals, student projects, and future revisions to the project.
