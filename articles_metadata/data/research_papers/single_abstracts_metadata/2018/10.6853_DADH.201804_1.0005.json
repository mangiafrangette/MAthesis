In this study, we selected more than 120 paintings as experimental samples and another 240 paintings from South Song dynasty as supporting materials. The selected paintings represent over 30 categories of motifs, such as Snowy Scene, Wintry Forests, Dwellings in Autumnal Mountains, the Mountain and Stream, etc. The image capture technology is used on paintings with two easily recognizable motifs 'fish-boat' and 'fisherman,' of which, 22 out of 132 document recorded paintings were selected. The experiment was carried out in several steps: the first step is to establish a descriptive and statistical model to analyze the formative evolution and character identification of fish-boat and fisherman in different time periods; the second step will construct a semantic network with feature words extracted from the motif information, thematic content and scenario settings of the paintings; finally, based on the cross-references of the image analysis and text mining, it attempts to establish a Full Image Information Retrieval Database for landscape paintings and related descriptions. At last, by studying ＂Fisherman-Hermit＂ Theme pattern in painting and its semantics, We test a validity of method of picture-text data model and digital humanity used in Chinese classic painting.", "article_title": "The Digital Humanities Research of the Landscape Painting of the Five Dynasties and Northern Song Dynasty (2): A Study of the ＂Fisherman-Hermit＂ Theme in Painting", "authors": [{"given": "Ping", "family": "Wang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Liang", "family": "Niu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Guan-Tao", "family": "Jin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Qing-Feng", "family": "Liu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2018-04-01", "keywords": ["digital humanities ", " landscape painting ", " Fisherman image ", " Northern Song dynasty ", " Neo-Confucianism"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
