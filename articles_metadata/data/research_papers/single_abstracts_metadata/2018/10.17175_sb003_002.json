Subsequently, requirements for a successful cooperation between scientists of different disciplinary backgrounds are presented, and finally, potentials arising from the digital context for the humanities are formulated. We understand digital humanities as a challenge and at the same time as an opportunity to bridge the separation of the sciences and humanities, which has been cultivated for too long.", "article_title": "Digital Humanities – Eine Herausforderung an die Informatik und an die Geisteswissenschaften", "authors": [{"given": "Klaus-Georg", "family": "Deck", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg, Digitalität und Data Science", "normalized_name": "Ravensburg University of Cooperative Education", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/014cnmj57", "GRID": "grid.449453.b"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2018-06-27", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Sonderband 3", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1366", "type": "electronic"}]}
