Several processes of parametrization, structural analysis, and robotic assembly are algorithmically integrated into a Design-to-Robotic-Production method. This method is informed by the systematic control of density, dimensionality, and directionality of the elements while taking environmental, functional, and structural requirements into consideration. It is tested by building a one-to-one prototype, which is presented and discussed in the paper with respect to the development and implementation of the computational design workflow coupled with robotic kinematic simulation that is enabling the materialization of a multidirectional and multidimensional assembly system.", "article_title": "Design to Robotic Assembly: An Exploration in Stacking", "authors": [{"given": "Yu-Chou", "family": "Chiang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Delft University of Technology", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02e2c7k09", "GRID": "grid.5292.c"}}]}, {"given": "Henriette", "family": "Bier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Delft University of Technology", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02e2c7k09", "GRID": "grid.5292.c"}}]}, {"given": "Sina", "family": "Mostafavi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Dessau Institute of Architecture, Anhalt University of Applied Sciences, Germany", "normalized_name": "Anhalt University of Applied Sciences", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0076zct58", "GRID": "grid.427932.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "date": "2018-10-16", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Frontiers in Digital Humanities", "volume": "5", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2297-2668", "type": "electronic"}]}
