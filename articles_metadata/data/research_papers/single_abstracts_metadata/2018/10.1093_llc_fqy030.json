Recently, statistics and data analysis were sought to be exploited in many research fields. In this study, statistics is applied to religious studies. Thirteen different orders of Quran’s revelation are considered. To start with, by using regression analysis, the similarity between these orders is investigated. The results show that all of the orders are highly related (R2 > 0.7, P < 0.001). Then, the hierarchical clustering method is used to cluster the orders. The results indicate that based on the similarity, different orders can be clustered in two groups; Cluster 1: ‘Ebn Abbas’, ‘Al-Azhar’, ‘Jaber’, ‘Ebn Nadim’, ‘Khazan’, and ‘Hazrat Ali’; Cluster 2: ‘Blachère’, ‘Bazargan’, ‘Nöldeke’, ‘Grimm’, ‘Muir’, ‘E'temad-al-Saltane’, and ‘Davood’. The results also determined that all of the orders are highly similar (mean of similarity >80%).", "article_title": "Statistical analysis about the order of Quran’s revelation", "authors": [{"given": " Mohammad", "family": "Reza Mahmoudi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, Fasa University, Fasa, Iran", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Ali", "family": "Abbasalizadeh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Persian Literature, Fasa University, Fasa, Iran", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-08-09", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
