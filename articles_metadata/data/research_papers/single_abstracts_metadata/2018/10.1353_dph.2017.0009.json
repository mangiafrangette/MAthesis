Whereas the New Philology elicited a largely skeptical response from practitioners of textual criticism and editorial philology, approaches informed by cultural studies have been more open to a constructive engagement with its tenets. Nevertheless, the question remains open as to whether German medieval studies have really followed the lead given by material philology and placed the manuscript as a physical object at the center of research to the extent that is often claimed.", "article_title": "Transmission and Materiality: Philology, Old and New, in German Medieval Studies", "authors": [{"given": "Martin", "family": "Baisch", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universität Hamburg", "normalized_name": "Universität Hamburg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00g30e956", "GRID": "grid.9026.d"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2018-04-08", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
