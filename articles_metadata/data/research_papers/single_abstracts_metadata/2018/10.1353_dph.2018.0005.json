Medieval manuscripts and modern editions give us texts that combine signals of original authorship with interfering signals of scribal authorship, dialectical variation, etc. This article suggests a way to use medieval texts in modern translation to isolate authentic signals of authorship. By using translation as a signal-processing filter and applying previously tested stylometric techniques based on character n-grams, the present study detects a different signal for Guillaume d'Angleterre than those found for other texts attributed to Chr√©tien de Troyes, suggesting different authorship.", "article_title": "Invisible Translator, Visible Author: Medieval Authorship Verification Through Modern Translation", "authors": [{"given": "Brian J.", "family": "Reilly", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fordham University", "normalized_name": "Fordham University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qnxaf80", "GRID": "grid.256023.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2018-08-12", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
