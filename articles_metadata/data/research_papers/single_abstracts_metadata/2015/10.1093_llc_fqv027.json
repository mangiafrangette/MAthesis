A prior polarity approach has been applied to a corpus of Italian historical texts, and a new lexical resource has been developed with a semi-automatic mapping starting from two English lexica. This article also reports on a first experiment on contextual polarity using both expert annotators and crowdsourced contributors. The long-term goal of our research is to create a system to support historical studies, which is able to analyse the sentiment in historical texts and to discover the opinion about a topic and its change over time.", "article_title": "Towards sentiment analysis for historical texts", "authors": [{"given": " Rachele", "family": "Sprugnoli", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy", "normalized_name": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01j33xk10", "GRID": "grid.11469.3b"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Trento", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05trd4x28", "GRID": "grid.11696.39"}}]}, {"given": " Sara", "family": "Tonelli", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy", "normalized_name": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01j33xk10", "GRID": "grid.11469.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Alessandro", "family": "Marchetti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Trento", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05trd4x28", "GRID": "grid.11696.39"}}]}, {"given": " Giovanni", "family": "Moretti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy", "normalized_name": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01j33xk10", "GRID": "grid.11469.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2015-07-30", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "31", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
