Whereas the Dartmouth Brut’s single painted border fulfills an “authorizing” function common in Middle English Prose Brut manuscripts, the seventy miniatures painted by the Master of Edward IV in Lambeth Palace Library MS 6 actually interpret history. This article transcribes instructions to the artist that survive on nine folios of Lambeth 6 and addresses how the manuscript planner and the artist negotiated differences of both medium (text, image) and language (English, French). The planner instructed that pictures match text; the artist’s interpretations and iconography yielded sometimes unexpected historical nuances.", "article_title": "Deciphering the Brut: Lambeth Palace MS 6 and the Perils of Transmission", "authors": [{"given": "Elizabeth J.", "family": "Bryan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Brown University", "normalized_name": "Brown University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gq02987", "GRID": "grid.40263.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2015-01-04", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
