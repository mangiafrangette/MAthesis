In addition to exploring the construction of a textual history that is populated by a series of phantasmal Iberian translators, manuscripts, and copyists, the creation of a modern Castilian edition of this lost Arabic chronicle speaks to the ideological basis and desires of modern, national philology.", "article_title": "Spanish Philology and the Arab Past: A Case Study", "authors": [{"given": "Michelle M.", "family": "Hamilton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Minnesota, Twin Cities", "normalized_name": "University of Minnesota", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017zqws13", "GRID": "grid.17635.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2015-08-02", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
