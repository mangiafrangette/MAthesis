The team of the University of Cyprus investigating the 4th-century BC Mazotos shipwreck are unable to interact easily and intuitively with the recorded data, a fact that impedes visualization and reconstruction and subsequently delays the evaluation of their hypotheses. An immersive 3D visualization application that utilizes a VR CAVE was developed, with the intent to enable researchers to mine the wealth of information this ancient shipwreck has to offer. Through the implementation and evaluation of the proposed application, this research seeks to investigate whether such an environment can aid the interpretation and analysis process and ultimately serve as an additional scientific tool for underwater archaeology.", "article_title": "Visualizing and Assessing Hypotheses for Marine Archaeology in a VR CAVE Environment", "authors": [{"given": "Irene", "family": "Katsouri", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus", "normalized_name": "Cyprus University of Technology", "country": "Cyprus", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05qt8tf94", "GRID": "grid.15810.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Aimilia", "family": "Tzanavari", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nicosia", "normalized_name": "University of Nicosia", "country": "Cyprus", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04v18t651", "GRID": "grid.413056.5"}}, {"original_name": "Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus", "normalized_name": "Cyprus University of Technology", "country": "Cyprus", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05qt8tf94", "GRID": "grid.15810.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Kyriakos", "family": "Herakleous", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus", "normalized_name": "Cyprus University of Technology", "country": "Cyprus", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05qt8tf94", "GRID": "grid.15810.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Charalambos", "family": "Poullis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus", "normalized_name": "Cyprus University of Technology", "country": "Cyprus", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05qt8tf94", "GRID": "grid.15810.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2015-03-09", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
