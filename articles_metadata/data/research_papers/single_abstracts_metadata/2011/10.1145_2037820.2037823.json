Our method does not require meshing or extensive processing of the input model, works on a coarsely spatially reordered point stream, and can adaptively refine point cloud geometry on the basis of image content. Seamless multiband image blending is obtained by using GPU-accelerated screen-space operators, which solve point set visibility, compute a per-pixel view-dependent weight, and ensure a smooth weighting function over each input image. The proposed approach works independently on each image in a memory-coherent manner, and can be easily extended to include further image-quality estimators. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a series of massive real-world point datasets.", "article_title": "Fast low-memory seamless photo blending on massive point clouds using a streaming framework", "authors": [{"given": "Ruggero", "family": "Pintus", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Visual Computing Group CRS4, Pula (CA), Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Enrico", "family": "Gobbetti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Visual Computing Group CRS4, Pula (CA), Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Marco", "family": "Callieri", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Visual Computing Group - ISTI-CNR, PISA, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2011-11-17", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "4", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
