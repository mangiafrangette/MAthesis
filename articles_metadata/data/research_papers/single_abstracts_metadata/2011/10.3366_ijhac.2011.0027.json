As questions of space, proximity and temporal relationships are central to the choice-making processes of both venue managers and potential spectators, so we sought to create a resource, based on a map of nineteenth-century Nottingham, that organised information about the town and its performance culture in ways that highlighted such connections and allowed us to explore the relationships between place, performance and audience within the town. Here we describe the creation of the resource and reflect on the development of our spatio-temporal mapping approach, arguing that this offers the potential to address patterns of connectivity and change across both time and space, not as a series of disconnected cross sections but rather as representative of the ‘world of process’ in which the events we study actually take place.
