Although NSC has many advantages, stylometric problems usually differ from genomics problems in several important ways: texts are of a wide range of sizes, a large series of texts are often the subjects for classification, and most importantly the set of candidate authors cannot usually be assumed to be closed. Consequently, na√Øve application of NSC methodology can produce misleading results. We extend the NSC methodology for more general application to stylometry. Reanalysis of the Book of Mormon using the open-set NSC method produced dramatically different results from a closed-set NSC analysis.", "article_title": "Extended nearest shrunken centroid classification: A new method for open-set authorship attribution of texts of varying sizes", "authors": [{"given": " G.
