The activities described as ‘Humanities Computing’ continue to expand in number and sophistication, yet no concrete definition of the field exists, and there are few academic departments that specialize in this area. Most introspection regarding the role, meaning, and focus of “Humanities Computing” has come from a practical and pragmatic perspective from scholars and educators within the field itself. This article provides an alternative, externalized, viewpoint of the focus of Humanities Computing, by analysing the discipline through its community, research, curriculum, teaching programmes, and the message they deliver, either consciously or unconsciously, about the scope of the discipline. It engages with Educational Theory to provide a means to analyse, measure, and define the field, and focuses specifically on the ACH/ALLC 2005 Conference to identify and analyse those who are involved with the humanities computing community.", "article_title": "Disciplined: Using Educational Studies to Analyse ‘Humanities Computing’", "authors": [{"given": " Melissa", "family": "Terras", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College", "normalized_name": "Moravská Vysoká Skola Olomouc", "country": "Czechia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00mwh6v70", "GRID": "grid.466028.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2006-04-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "21", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
