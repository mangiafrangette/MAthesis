This system processes morphologically the words via the repetitive application of a masking-and-matching technique. It is found that the introduction of a priori information regarding the grammar of the Greek language considerably improves the word segmentation accuracy. The system accuracy is evaluated by comparing the word segmentation with the entries of a morphological lexicon of the Greek language. The experimental results indicate that the output of the automated system is—for the majority of words—in agreement with the entries of the morphological lexicon. The proposed system is successfully applied to the generation of specialized morphological lexica on the basis of corpora consisting of term-intensive documents. Finally, possible extensions of the proposed system to other languages as well as to cover the derivation phenomenon for the Greek language are briefly reviewed.", "article_title": "Automatic Corpora-based Stemming in Greek", "authors": [{"given": " G.", "family": "Tambouratzis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Language and Speech ProcessingGreece", "normalized_name": "Institute for Language and Speech Processing", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00z24kr14", "GRID": "grid.424851.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
