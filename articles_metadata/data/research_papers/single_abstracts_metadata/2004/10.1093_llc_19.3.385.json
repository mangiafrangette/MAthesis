It outlines John Ruskinâ€™s links with Oxford, his reasons for creating the collection as an aid to his teaching of drawing at the University, and the ways in which he organized and catalogued the collection. It then discusses the particular benefits which digitization brings to the collection, and outlines the methods being used to digitize the collection as a series of images, texts, catalogue data, and associated metadata, and how it is being made available over the world wide web.", "article_title": "The Elements of Drawing", "authors": [{"given": "J.", "family": "Miller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "19", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
