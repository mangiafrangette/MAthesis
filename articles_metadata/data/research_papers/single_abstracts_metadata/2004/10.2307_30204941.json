Heretofore theories about the intentionality of Bach's compositional choices in this regard have necessarily remained conjectural. In the following study, an objective measurement of pitch diversity in the vocal lines of Bach's church cantata recitatives in relation to literary themes was made possible with specially designed computer software allowing pertinent information to be entered efficiently into a relational database. Because the software tracked not only the 90,000 pitches constituting the vocal lines of these movements but also other attributes (e.g., overall length, presence or absence of accompaniment, opening and closing keys, chronological position, among others), interrelationships among the various attributes could be examined. Findings demonstrate clear correlation between pitch diversity and the degree of affective tension implied by particular textual subjects. While the findings do not prove exclusive causation (other factors such as tonal and structural considerations, social occasion, and evolution of style can also play a role), they do link the two elements, especially in light of Bach's method of composition as documented by Robert Marshall. This study is important for its systematic and comprehensive approach, its findings giving definition and clarity to commonly held generalizations about the relationships between melodic chromaticism (of which pitch diversity is an important aspect and indicator) and textual content. Furthermore, the software holds promise for additional studies of Bach's pitch materials and for studies in other stylistic contexts.", "article_title": "Uncovering Text-Music Connections with a Relational Database: Towards an Objective Measurement of Melodic Pitch Diversity in Relation to Literary Themes in Bach's Church Cantata Recitatives", "authors": [{"given": "Melvin", "family": "Unger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Riemenschneider Bach Institute, Baldwin-Wallace College, 275 Eastland Rd., Berea, Ohio, 44017, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
