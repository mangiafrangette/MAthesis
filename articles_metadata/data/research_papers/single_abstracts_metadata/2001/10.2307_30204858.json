Since a large portion of language is represented by collocation patterns, the collocational knowledge provides a valuable resource for NLP applications. One difficulty of collocation extraction is that Korean has a partially free word order, which also appears in collocations. In this work, we exploit four statistics, 'frequency', 'randomness', 'convergence', and 'correlation' in order to take into account the flexible word order of Korean collocations. We separate meaningful bigrams using an evaluation function based on the four statistics and extend the bigrams to n-gram collocations using a fuzzy relation. Experiments show that this method works well for Korean collocations.", "article_title": "Automatic Extraction of Collocations from Korean Text", "authors": [{"given": "Seonho", "family": "Kim", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, Yonsei University", "normalized_name": "Yonsei University", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01wjejq96", "GRID": "grid.15444.30"}}]}, {"given": "Juntae", "family": "Yoon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, Yonsei University", "normalized_name": "Yonsei University", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01wjejq96", "GRID": "grid.15444.30"}}]}, {"given": "Mansuk", "family": "Song", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, Yonsei University", "normalized_name": "Yonsei University", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01wjejq96", "GRID": "grid.15444.30"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
