A hierarchical \"item-based\" model is proposed which can be readily implemented as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) tagging scheme that can represent any kind of archaeological data and deliver it in a cross-platform, standardized fashion to any Web browser. This tagging scheme and the data model it implements permit seamless integration and joint querying of archaeological datasets derived from many different sources.", "article_title": "Archaeological Data Models and Web Publication Using XML", "authors": [{"given": "J.
