The latter integrates a suite of eResearch tools to support the collaborative authoring and management of electronic scholarly editions. The discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of building an electronic edition in such an environment and considers the ways in which the product of these activities begins to move beyond the model of the book. Central to the discussion is the idea of an ontology-based electronic edition, not as an end in itself, but as the ongoing activity of one or more human beings contributing to the creation and assembly of constituent parts with digital tools.", "article_title": "Archiving, editing, and reading on the AustESE Workbench: Assembling and theorizing an ontology-based electronic scholarly edition of Joseph Furphy’sSuch is Life", "authors": [{"given": " Roger", "family": "Osborne", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Communication and Arts, University of Queensland", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}, {"given": " Anna", "family": "Gerber", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "eResearch Group, University of Queensland", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}, {"given": " Jane", "family": "Hunter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "eResearch Group, University of Queensland", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016-12-28", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "31", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
