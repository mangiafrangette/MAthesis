I turn to the work of Aby Warburg who attempted to organize close to two thousand images in his Mnemosyne Atlas. In comparing contemporary methods of image data visualization through cultural analytics method of remapping and the turn of the century methodology developed by Warburg under the working title of the “iconology of intervals,” I examine the shifts and continuities that have shaped informational aesthetics as well as data-driven narratives. Furthermore, in drawing parallels between contemporary Cultural Analytics/Media Visualization techniques, and Aby Warburg’s Atlas, I argue that contextual and image color data knowledge should continue to be important for digital art history. More specifically, I take the case study of Warburg’s Panel 45 in order to explore what we can learn through different visualization techniques about the role of color in the representation of violence and the promise of prosperous civil society.", "article_title": "Images as Data: Cultural Analytics and Aby Warburg’s Mnemosyne", "authors": [{"given": "Stefka", "family": "Hristova", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Michigan  Technological University", "normalized_name": "Michigan Technological University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0036rpn28", "GRID": "grid.259979.9"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2016-10-18", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal for Digital Art History", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2363-5401", "type": "electronic"}, {"value": "2363-5398", "type": "print"}]}
