Through mapping the level of user engagement in “openness of data,” “openness of methodologies and workflows,” and “reuse of existing data,” this study contributes to the current knowledge in data sharing and open access, and supports the strategic development of institutional data stewardship. Asking faculty researchers to self-reflect sharing and reuse from both data producers’ and data users’ perspectives, the study reveals a significant gap between the rather limited sharing activities and the highly perceived reuse or repurpose values regarding data, indicating that potential values of data for future research are lost right after the original work is done. The localized and sporadic data management and documentation practices of researchers also contribute to the obstacles they themselves often encounter when reusing existing data.   ", "article_title": "Research Data Sharing and Reuse Practices of Academic Faculty Researchers: A Study of the Virginia Tech Data Landscape", "authors": [{"given": "Yi", "family": "Shen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University", "normalized_name": "Virginia Tech", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02smfhw86", "GRID": "grid.438526.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2016-05-14", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "10", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
