This study first considers Guillaume’s disgruntled reader in the Jugement dou roy de Navarre before turning to later readers who reenacted her desires when dealing with Machaut’s manuscripts. Finally, nuancing complaints that digitization distances us from the manuscript artifact, I consider how the digital surrogate reignites a desire for the textual body that defined the late-medieval reading experience.", "article_title": "Textual Bodies, the Digital Surrogate, and Desire: Guillaume de Machaut’s Judgment Cycle and his Protean Corpus", "authors": [{"given": "Deborah", "family": "McGrady", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2016-06-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
