Its aim is to advance the field of telematics research of literary texts. As it is, literary research is already in checkmate for its high degree of subjectivity and lack of an approach to ensure the effectiveness of its results as it happens in the so-called Hard Sciences. Therefore, when a literato launches him/herself to do research with the use of text analysis software, he/she has to learn from science how to report his/her search so that his/her peers can reproduce the experiment and come to similar results.", "article_title": "On the Path to a Methodology for the Critique of Digital Literature", "authors": [{"given": " Saulo Cunha de Serpa", "family": "Brandão", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universidade Federal do Piauí, Brazil", "normalized_name": "Federal University of Piauí", "country": "Brazil", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00kwnx126", "GRID": "grid.412380.c"}}]}, {"given": " Wander Nunes", "family": "Frota", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universidade Federal do Piauí, Brazil", "normalized_name": "Federal University of Piauí", "country": "Brazil", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00kwnx126", "GRID": "grid.412380.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016-03-25", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
