However, most research has been conducted on contemporary benchmark sets. These datasets typically do not contain any noise or artefacts caused by the conversion methodology. This article analyses how current state-of-the-art methods in writer identification perform on historical documents. In contrast to contemporary documents, historical data often contain artefacts such as holes, rips, or water stains which make reliable identification error-prone. Experiments were conducted on two large letter collections with known authenticity and promising results of 82% and 89% TOP-1 accuracy were achieved.", "article_title": "Automatic Writer Identification in Historical Documents: A Case Study", "authors": [{"given": "Vincent", "family": "Christlein", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Pattern Recognition Lab, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg", "normalized_name": "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f7hpc57", "GRID": "grid.5330.5"}}]}, {"given": "Markus", "family": "Diem", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computer Vision Lab, TU Wien", "normalized_name": "TU Wien", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d836q62", "GRID": "grid.5329.d"}}]}, {"given": "Florian", "family": "Kleber", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computer Vision Lab, TU Wien", "normalized_name": "TU Wien", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d836q62", "GRID": "grid.5329.d"}}]}, {"given": "Günter", "family": "Mühlberger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digitisation and Digital Preservation (DEA), German Language and Literature, Innsbruck University", "normalized_name": "Universität Innsbruck", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/054pv6659", "GRID": "grid.5771.4"}}]}, {"given": "Verena", "family": "Schwägerl-Melchior", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Sprachwissenschaft, Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz", "normalized_name": "University of Graz", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01faaaf77", "GRID": "grid.5110.5"}}]}, {"given": "Esther", "family": "van Gelder", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Descartes Centre (Universiteit Utrecht)", "normalized_name": "Utrecht University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pp8hn57", "GRID": "grid.5477.1"}}, {"original_name": "Huygens ING (KNAW)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Andreas", "family": "Maier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Pattern Recognition Lab, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg", "normalized_name": "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f7hpc57", "GRID": "grid.5330.5"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2016-07-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Heft 1.2016", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1358", "type": "electronic"}]}
