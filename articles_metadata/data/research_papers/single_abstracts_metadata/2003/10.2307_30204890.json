After briefly discussing perceived and actual vocabulary richness, I show that doubling and combining texts affects some measures in computationally predictable but conceptually surprising ways. I discuss some theoretical and empirical problems with some measures and develop simple methods to test how well vocabulary richness distinguishes texts by different authors. These methods show that vocabulary richness is ineffective for large groups of texts because of the extreme variability within and among them. I conclude that vocabulary richness is of marginal value in stylistic and authorship studies because the basic assumption that it constitutes a wordprint for authors is false.", "article_title": "Another Perspective on Vocabulary Richness", "authors": [{"given": "David L.", "family": "Hoover", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "New York University", "normalized_name": "New York University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0190ak572", "GRID": "grid.137628.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2003-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "37", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
