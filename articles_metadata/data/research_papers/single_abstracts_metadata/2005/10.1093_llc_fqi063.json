Intertextual distance provides a simple and interesting solution. Its properties make it a good tool for text classification, and especially for tree-analysis which is fully presented and discussed here. In order to measure the quality of this classification, two indices are proposed. The method presented provides an accurate tool for literary studies—as is demonstrated by applying it to two areas of French literature, Racine's tragedies and an authorship attribution experiment.", "article_title": "A Tool for Literary Studies: Intertextual Distance and Tree Classification", "authors": [{"given": " Cyril", "family": "Labbé", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Grenoble I University, France", "normalized_name": "Joseph Fourier University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02aj0kh94", "GRID": "grid.9621.c"}}]}, {"given": " Dominique", "family": "Labbé", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Grenoble II University, France", "normalized_name": "Joseph Fourier University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02aj0kh94", "GRID": "grid.9621.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2005-10-28", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "21", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
