I will argue that in Lysias' works, narrative descriptions of violence are characterized by the unusually frequent use of the participle. I will further show that the association of high participle density and narratives about violence are a subset of a larger pattern relating to use of the participle in Lysias' works. In this pattern, Lysias uses unusually large numbers of participles: (1) only within the narrative and argumentative sections of the speeches; (2) to structure the work and mark the conclusion of narrative arcs and lines of argument; (3) in their role as a structuring device, these passages also provide immediacy and momentum to the argument or narrative descriptions of events; and (4) to mark a return in subject matter to the case at hand and to focus the attention of the jury on the question that is before them.", "article_title": "Talking About Violence: Clustered Participles in the Speeches of Lysias", "authors": [{"given": " Jeff", "family": "Rydberg-Cox", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Missouri-Kansas City", "normalized_name": "University of Missouriâ€“Kansas City", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01w0d5g70", "GRID": "grid.266756.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2005-05-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "20", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
