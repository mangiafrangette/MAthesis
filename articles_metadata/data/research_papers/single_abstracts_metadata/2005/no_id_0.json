Because these paralipomena – by definition – do not belong to any specific version, they are often left out of critical editions. In scholarly editing, the notion of ›version‹ is usually defined as a text that already possesses a minimum of syntactic and structural characteristics of the published text. But in a work like James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, characterized by numerous linguistic distortions, a single word can undergo several stages of transformation even before it is incorporated into a draft or ›version‹ of the text. This necessitates a smaller concept of the ›version‹ (›word version‹ or ›Wortfassung‹ as opposed to ›Textfassung‹). By using a separate XML tag to indicate paralipomena and external reference tags to indicate their relation to previous and subsequent word versions, it is possible to chart the development of verbal transformations and include paralipomena as an integral part of a work’s genesis.", "article_title": "The Inclusion of Paralipomena in Genetic Editions", "authors": [{"given": "Dirk", "family": "Van Hulle", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Antwerp", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005-12-23", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
