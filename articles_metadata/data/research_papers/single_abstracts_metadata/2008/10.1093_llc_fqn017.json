Through log analysis techniques, the LAIRAH project identified twenty-one popular and well-used digital humanities projects, and in order to ascertain the factors they had in common, which predisposed them to be well used, conducted in-depth interviews with the creators of these resources. This article presents the findings of the study, highlighting areas that developers should be aware of, and providing a set of recommendations for both funders and creators, which should ensure that a digital humanities resource will have the best possible chance of being used in the long term.", "article_title": "The master builders: LAIRAH research on good practice in the construction of digital humanities projects", "authors": [{"given": " Claire", "family": "Warwick", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Isabel", "family": "Galina", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Melissa", "family": "Terras", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Paul", "family": "Huntington", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Nikoleta", "family": "Pappa", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archive and Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2008-09-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
