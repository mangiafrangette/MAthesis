The community as a whole tends not to be aware of the tools developed by DH practitioners (as documented by the recent surveys by Siemens et al.), and tends not to take seriously many of the results of scholarship obtained by DH methods and tools. This article argues for a focus on deliverable results in the form of useful solutions to common problems that humanities scholars share, instead of simply new representations. The question to address is what needs the humanities community has that can be dealt with using DH tools and techniques, or equivalently what incentive humanists have to take up and to use new methods. This can be treated in some respects like the computational quest for the ‘killer application’—a need of the user group that can be filled, and by filling it, create an acceptance of that tool and the supporting methods/results. Some definitions and examples are provided both to illustrate the idea and to support why this is necessary. The apparent alternative is the status quo, where digital research tools are brilliantly developed, only to languish in neglect and disuse.", "article_title": "Killer Applications in Digital Humanities", "authors": [{"given": " Patrick", "family": "Juola", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA 15282, USA", "normalized_name": "Duquesne University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02336z538", "GRID": "grid.255272.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2008-02-14", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
