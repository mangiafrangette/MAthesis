We argue that the digital preservation of objects in IRs may better be achieved through the use of light-weight, add-on services. We present such a service – PRONOM-ROAR – that generates file format profiles for IRs. This demonstrates the potential of using third- party services to provide preservation expertise to IR managers by making use of existing machine interfaces to IRs.", "article_title": "PRONOM-ROAR: Adding Format Profiles to a Repository Registry to Inform Preservation Services", "authors": [{"given": "Tim", "family": "Brody", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Southampton", "normalized_name": "University of Southampton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ryk1543", "GRID": "grid.5491.9"}}]}, {"given": "Leslie", "family": "Carr", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Southampton", "normalized_name": "University of Southampton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ryk1543", "GRID": "grid.5491.9"}}]}, {"given": "Jessie M.
