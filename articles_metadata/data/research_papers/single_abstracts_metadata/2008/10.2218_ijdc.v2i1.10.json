This paper describes TNAâ€™s methodologies for characterisation, preservation planning, and preservation action, the technologies being adopted to implement them, and the role of PRONOM in supporting these services. It describes how this approach fits with international research programmes, and the types of preservation service which TNA may be able to provide externally in the future.", "article_title": "Developing Practical Approaches to Active Preservation", "authors": [{"given": "Adrian", "family": "Brown", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The National Archives, UK", "normalized_name": "National Archives", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/033jcqk26", "GRID": "grid.421611.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008-12-02", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
