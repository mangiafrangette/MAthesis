The results are: an operational archive built with XML containers, the OAI-PMH protocol and an architecture based upon web services. Major conclusions are: quality control on ingest is important; digital rights management demands attention; and cost aspects of ingest and retrieval cannot be underestimated. We propose a new paradigm for information retrieval of this type of dataset. We recommend research into visualisation tools for the search and retrieval of this type of dataset.", "article_title": "Dataset Preservation for the Long Term: Results of the DareLux Project", "authors": [{"given": "Eugène", "family": "Dürr", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Utrecht University and Euformatics b.v.,Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Utrecht University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pp8hn57", "GRID": "grid.5477.1"}}]}, {"given": "Kees", "family": "Van der Meer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Delft University of Technology, Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Delft University of Technology", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02e2c7k09", "GRID": "grid.5292.c"}}]}, {"given": "Wim", "family": "Luxemburg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Delft University of Technology, Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Delft University of Technology", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02e2c7k09", "GRID": "grid.5292.c"}}]}, {"given": "Ronald", "family": "Dekker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Delft University of Technology Library, Netherlands", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008-12-02", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
