But although astronomy now has archives for its primary research telescopes and associated surveys, the highly processed data that is presented in the peer-reviewed journals and is the basis for final analysis and interpretation is generally not archived and has no permanent repository. We have initiated a project whose goal is to implement an end-to-end prototype system which, through a partnership of a professional society, that societyâ€™s scholarly publications/publishers, research libraries, and an information technology substrate provided by the Virtual Observatory, will capture high-level digital data as part of the publication process and establish a distributed network of curated, permanent data repositories. The data in this network will be accessible through the research journals, astronomy data centers, and Virtual Observatory data discovery portals.", "article_title": "Digital Data Preservation for Scholarly Publications in Astronomy", "authors": [{"given": "Sayeed", "family": "Choudhury", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Johns Hopkins University", "normalized_name": "Johns Hopkins University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00za53h95", "GRID": "grid.21107.35"}}]}, {"given": "Tim", "family": "DiLauro", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Johns Hopkins University", "normalized_name": "Johns Hopkins University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00za53h95", "GRID": "grid.21107.35"}}]}, {"given": "Alex", "family": "Szalay", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Johns Hopkins University", "normalized_name": "Johns Hopkins University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00za53h95", "GRID": "grid.21107.35"}}]}, {"given": "Ethan", "family": "Vishniac", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Johns Hopkins University", "normalized_name": "Johns Hopkins University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00za53h95", "GRID": "grid.21107.35"}}]}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Hanisch", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Space Telescope Science Institute", "normalized_name": "Space Telescope Science Institute", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/036f5mx38", "GRID": "grid.419446.a"}}]}, {"given": "Julie", "family": "Steffen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Chicago Press", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Milkey", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "American Astronomical Society", "normalized_name": "American Astronomical Society", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00b93bs30", "GRID": "grid.298902.8"}}]}, {"given": "Teresa", "family": "Ehling", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cornell University", "normalized_name": "Cornell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bnh6r87", "GRID": "grid.5386.8"}}]}, {"given": "Ray", "family": "Plante", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Illinois", "normalized_name": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047426m28", "GRID": "grid.35403.31"}}, {"original_name": "National Center for Supercomputing Applications", "normalized_name": "National Center for Supercomputing Applications", "country": "Bulgaria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03g9ch715", "GRID": "grid.432563.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008-12-02", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "2", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
