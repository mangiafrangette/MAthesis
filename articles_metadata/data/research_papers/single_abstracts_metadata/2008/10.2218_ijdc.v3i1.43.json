We share insights gained from our exploration of issues concerned with the capture of crystallography and engineering RI as well as its structuring, collection and curation. In addition, we discuss the supporting technical, IPR and globally collaborative infrastructures required to make such a strategy successful.", "article_title": "Challenges and Issues Relating to the Use of Representation Information for the Digital Curation of Crystallography and Engineering Data", "authors": [{"given": "Manjula", "family": "Patel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UKOLN, University of Bath", "normalized_name": "University of Bath", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002h8g185", "GRID": "grid.7340.0"}}]}, {"given": "Alexander", "family": "Ball", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UKOLN, University of Bath", "normalized_name": "University of Bath", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002h8g185", "GRID": "grid.7340.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008-12-02", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
