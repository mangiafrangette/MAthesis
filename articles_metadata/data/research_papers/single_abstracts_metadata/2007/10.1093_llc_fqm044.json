More specifically, we describe an experiment to evaluate automatic techniques for the development of letter replacement heuristics against manually created gold standards of known letter replacements rules. As will become clear, the motivation for the research differs according to the team of researchers: the German researchers are seeking to develop a search engine for historical texts; the English researchers want to improve the results obtained when applying corpus linguistic techniques (developed for modern language) to historical data. However, the respective teams do share a longer term goal of assessing whether it is possible to develop a generic spelling detection tool for Indo-European languages.", "article_title": "The Identification of Spelling Variants in English and German Historical Texts: Manual or Automatic?", "authors": [{"given": " Thomas", "family": "Pilz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and Applied Cognitive Science, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, D-47048 Duisburg, Lotharstr. 65, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Duisburg-Essen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04mz5ra38", "GRID": "grid.5718.b"}}]}, {"given": " Andrea", "family": "Ernst-Gerlach", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and Applied Cognitive Science, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, D-47048 Duisburg, Lotharstr. 65, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Duisburg-Essen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04mz5ra38", "GRID": "grid.5718.b"}}]}, {"given": " Sebastian", "family": "Kempken", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and Applied Cognitive Science, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen, D-47048 Duisburg, Lotharstr. 65, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Duisburg-Essen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04mz5ra38", "GRID": "grid.5718.b"}}]}, {"given": " Paul", "family": "Rayson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computing Department, Infolab21, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4WA, UK", "normalized_name": "Lancaster University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04f2nsd36", "GRID": "grid.9835.7"}}]}, {"given": " Dawn", "family": "Archer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Humanities, University of Central Lancashire, Preston PR1 2HE, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Central Lancashire", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010jbqd54", "GRID": "grid.7943.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2007-11-25", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
