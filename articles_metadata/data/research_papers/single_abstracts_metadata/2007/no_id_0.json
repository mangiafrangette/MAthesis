Although it is evident that new technics and methods of data processing will become more and more relevant it seems surprising to find that the trial and methodical reflexion of digitally supported methods have not found too much interest among researchers in History of Concepts in the past. This neglect seems even more striking as the digital media offer a broad set of methodically and practically highly interesting possibilities for projects on the History of Concepts. The article discusses the meaning of the new digital media for the History of Concepts in relation to three dimensions: to new possibilities of data aquisition and systematisation, concerning new forms of archive systems and, not least, new forms of presentation of the results. The article demonstrates special demands and desiderats; its aim is to stimulate discussions between the History of Concepts, Computerphilologists and Programmers.", "article_title": "Zur Bedeutung der Computertechnik f端r die Begriffsgeschichte", "authors": [{"given": "Falko", "family": "Schmieder", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Zentrum f端r Literatur- und Kulturforschung", "normalized_name": "Leibniz-Zentrum f端r Literatur- und Kulturforschung", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bpta863", "GRID": "grid.461667.4"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2007-11-09", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch f端r Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
