Adding modern punctuation to ancient scriptures is the basis for the collation and research of ancient scriptures, however, it is a very tedious process. Therefore, it is of practical significance to realize automatic punctuation of ancient scriptures by means of artificial intelligence (AI). We apply the latest tool of deep learning (DL) in the field of natural language processing (NLP) to train the two models of long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolution neural network (CNN) on a training set of more than 50 million Chinese characters and approximately 10 million punctuations. Then, on the test set of Buddhist texts from six different dynasties, the highest punctuation accuracy of 94.3% was achieved. At present, the system can mark seven kinds of modern punctuations (comma, period, question mark, exclamation mark, dunhao, semicolon, colon) for ancient texts.", "article_title": "A Method and Implementation of Automatic Punctuation", "authors": [{"given": "Xianchao", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Kaiqi", "family": "Fang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Xianjiong", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Xianju", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Xiandiao", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Xianji", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Xianda", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Xianfeng", "family": "Shi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Yanchun", "family": "Song", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2019-04-01", "keywords": ["automatic punctuation ", " ancient scriptures ", " long short-term memory (LSTM) ", " deep learning ", " natural language processing"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "3", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
