However, professionals in both fields are trusted to attest to the identity and integrity of digital documents and traces â€“ they are regarded as experts in the acquisition, interpretation, description and presentation of that material. Archival science and digital forensics evolved out of practice and grew into established professional disciplines by developing theoretical foundations, which then returned to inform and standardize that practice. They have their roots in legal requirements and law enforcement. A significant challenge to both fields, therefore, is the identification of records (archival focus) and evidence (digital forensics focus) in digital systems, establishing their contexts, provenance, relationships, and meaning. This paper traces the development of digital forensics from practice to theory and presents the parallels with archival science.", "article_title": "From time theft to time stamps: mapping the development of digital forensics from law enforcement to archival authority", "authors": [{"given": "Corinne", "family": "Rogers", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Library, Archival and Information Studies, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of British Columbia", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rmrcq20", "GRID": "grid.17091.3e"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019-03-04", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
