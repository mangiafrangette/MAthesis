Many of the seal’s attributes contain uncertainties, which require special attention if they are incorporated into the graph database. The article examines where the uncertainties originate from and presents how they can be modelled in the graph database. Finally, a practical example is presented, which focuses on depictions of creatures on seals and makes use of the created graph database.", "article_title": "A Graph Database of Aegean Seals with Uncertain Attributes", "authors": [{"given": "Martina", "family": "Trognitz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities", "normalized_name": "Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/028bsh698", "GRID": "grid.475759.d"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2019-04-10", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Sonderband 4", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1366", "type": "electronic"}]}
