In that respect, research involving GIS will be examined in order to evaluate, in particular, what the results are for the history discipline in terms of its methods, its concepts, and its renewal, or nonrenewal, of knowledge. Before presenting its initial findings, we will retouch on questions underlying this study and indicate some essential methodological elements.", "article_title": "Histoire et SIG: vers une heuristique des cartes relationnelles", "authors": [{"given": "Anolga", "family": "Rodionoff", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universités Paris Lumières", "normalized_name": "Université Paris Lumières", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03b4d6f26", "GRID": "grid.508547.b"}}, {"original_name": "Université de Saint-Etienne", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019-11-04", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
