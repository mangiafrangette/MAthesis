The research conducted here focuses on a corpus of letters written by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. Using stylometric analysis, we model the writing styles of the brothers depending on the addressees and chronology. The brothers have individual styles: Wilhelm has a more friendly and personal tone independent on addresses, while Jacob has a more impersonal style, unless he was writing to Wilhelm. Their styles merge at the interactions of their career or personal development.", "article_title": "The Grimm Brothers: A stylometric network analysis", "authors": [{"given": " Gabriela", "family": "Rotari", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Göttingen, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Göttingen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01y9bpm73", "GRID": "grid.7450.6"}}]}, {"given": " Melina", "family": "Jander", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Göttingen, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Göttingen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01y9bpm73", "GRID": "grid.7450.6"}}]}, {"given": " Jan", "family": "Rybicki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Jagiellonian University, Poland", "normalized_name": "Jagiellonian University", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03bqmcz70", "GRID": "grid.5522.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019-12-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
