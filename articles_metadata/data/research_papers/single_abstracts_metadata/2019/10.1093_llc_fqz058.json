Based on the constructed ontology, we developed and implemented a new framework for catalogue data enrichment, correction, and its systematic quantitative analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the results of the proposed large-scale analysis of three most prominent event types in the corpus, as well as a few cross-event relations and trends.", "article_title": "Ontology-based analysis of the large collection of historical Hebrew manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": "Zhitomirsky-Geffet, Gila Prebor and Isaac Miller, Maayan", "family": null, "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Science, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, 5290002, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019-08-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
