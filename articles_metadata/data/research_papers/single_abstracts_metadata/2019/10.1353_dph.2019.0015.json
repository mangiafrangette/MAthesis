How might the royal photograph be both sacred and secular? How are premodern understandings of kingship, including the taboo on the monarchy's public representation, reconciled with the contemporary hypervisibility of the monarchy? And what implications do references to the premodern past have for debates over defining democracy in Thailand?", "article_title": "The Feudal Photograph of a Democratic Dhammaraja: Secularism and Sacrality in Thai Royal Imagery", "authors": [{"given": "Clare", "family": "Veal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "LASALLE College of the Arts", "normalized_name": "LASALLE College of the Arts", "country": "Singapore", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s8jdf66", "GRID": "grid.443361.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019-07-21", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
