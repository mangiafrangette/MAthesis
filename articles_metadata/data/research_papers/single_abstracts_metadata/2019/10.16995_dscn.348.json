The different critical conventions are well known and have been subject to a myriad of scientific studies. Nevertheless, critical edition has been undergoing changes since the development of new technologies. Digital critical editions have multiplied and today represent a large and varied panel. As a consequence, it’s worth observing, beyond technological innovations, what digital editing brings in terms of methodology and publishing conceptualisation. Obviously, in digital editions as in traditional editions, the final goal is offering readers a text that they will be able to consult and use in their research: the edited text should be a stable one, that can be an authoritative resource. The uniqueness of digital edition’s design, however, requires editors to reflect, right from the start of the publication process, on the information that they are going to provide, as well as on the way in which they will be presenting it. From the very beginning of its development, digital editing entails, then, a true awareness of how it will be received. It permits, also, a significant diversification of information presented in editions. It ultimately distinguishes itself with its open nature: digital editing is open in terms of content evolution over time just as it is in terms of collaborative editing.", "article_title": "Le positionnement éditorial dans l’édition critique numérique", "authors": [{"given": "Joana", "family": "Casenave", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Lille", "normalized_name": "University of Lille", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02kzqn938", "GRID": "grid.503422.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019-09-18", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
