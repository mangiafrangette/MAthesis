Today, many decisions are made in online environments. Gaining insights about digital nudging can greatly help communicators, policy makers, and designers lead users to make the most desirable choice for them and/or for the wealth of the society as well. Digital nudges can be used in many digital environments like e-mail, SMS, push notifications, mobile apps, social media, gamification, e-commerce, e-government, location services, corporate digital information systems, and many other digital interfaces that include any kind of decision-making processes. This study is a descriptive study and more of a qualitative nature and aims to identify the digital nudging concept, dark patterns, and usage of digital nudges in real-life applications. It also proposes a brief digital nudging process schema to be used for designing behavioral digital interventions.
