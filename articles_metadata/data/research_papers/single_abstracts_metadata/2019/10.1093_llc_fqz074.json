Headlines are among the most important parts of a news story and its summary. This study investigates the construction of Qaddafi in the headlines of two newspapers before and during the 2011 Libyan civil war. This is based on a sub-corpus of headlines that was taken from a 6.5-million-word corpus of two newspapers; one published in English; The Guardian, and the other in Arabic; Asharq Al-Awsat from 2009 to 2011. The analysis of the headlines has produced complementary and convergent findings with the corpus analysis and suggests that the 2011 Libyan civil war represents a turning point on how Qaddafi is represented in the investigated newspapers. This study concludes that analysing headlines proves to be a good down-sampling option to reduce large news corpora to a workable amount of data.", "article_title": "Analysing headlines as a way of downsizing news corpora: Evidence from an Arabicâ€“English comparable corpus of newspaper articles", "authors": [{"given": " Ahmad S", "family": "Haider", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English Language and Translation, Applied Science Private University, Amman 11192, Jordan", "normalized_name": "Applied Science Private University", "country": "Jordan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ah6nb52", "GRID": "grid.411423.1"}}]}, {"given": " Riyad F", "family": "Hussein", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English Language and Translation, Applied Science Private University, Amman 11192, Jordan", "normalized_name": "Applied Science Private University", "country": "Jordan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ah6nb52", "GRID": "grid.411423.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019-10-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
