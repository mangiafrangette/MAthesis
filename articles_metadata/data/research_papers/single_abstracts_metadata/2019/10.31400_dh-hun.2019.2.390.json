Although this stylistic concept has become a key characteristic feature of Mikszáth’s oeuvre, no attempt has been made to elaborate on its definition. As scholarship assumes a clear-cut and measurable distinction between the written “literary” and “spoken” language, this paper claims that this spoken language has quantifiable linguistic markers. This is demonstrated by the morphological analysis of Kálmán Mikszáth and Mór Jókai’s fictional writings.", "article_title": "Machine-readable Literature: ”Spoken Language” in Mikszáth’s Short Stories", "authors": [{"given": "Gergely", "family": "Labádi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE)", "date": "2019-10-18", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digitális Bölcsészet", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2630-9696", "type": "electronic"}]}
