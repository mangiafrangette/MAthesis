Overall, the best Mandarin singer music worker community network is quite large (diameter = 7), and the community members are highly connected (average path length = 2.156). However, unlike the small world network model, the whole the network average clustering coefficient value is relatively low (average clustering coefficient = 0.02), showing that the artists have a wide range of collaborators. In addition, a high modularity was observed (# of modules = 22, modularity score = 0.72), suggesting collaboration tend to be more cohesive around certain music styles. We also examined the relationship between an artists' network position and the diversity of the roles she/he played in the creative process such as lyricists, composers, producers, or arrangers. The diversity of an artist's creative role was calculated by Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. A significant correlation was found between a nominee's role diversity and his/her centrality.", "article_title": "Creative Role Analysis of the Best Male/Female Mandarin Singer Nominees in Taiwan Golden Melody Awards (2007-2018)", "authors": [{"given": "Wei-Min", "family": "Fan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Muh-Chyun", "family": "Tang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2019-04-01", "keywords": ["Golden Melody Awards ", " best male/female mandarin singers ", " music workers ", " social network analysis ", " centrality"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "3", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
