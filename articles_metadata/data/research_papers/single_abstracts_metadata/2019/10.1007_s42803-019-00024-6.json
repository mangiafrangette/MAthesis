The goal of this article is not to create a single or the lowest common denominator to which both DSEs and 3D models subscribe, nor is it to reduce 3D to one scholarly editing tradition. It is rather to problematise the development of a model by borrowing concepts and values from editorial scholarship in order to enable public-facing 3D scholarship to be read in the same way that scholarly editions are by providing context, transmission history, and transparency of the editorial method/decision-making process.", "article_title": "Textuality in 3D: three-dimensional (re)constructions as digital scholarly editions", "authors": [{"given": "Susan", "family": "Schreibman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Literature & Art, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Maastricht Uiversity, Maastricht, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Costas", "family": "Papadopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Literature & Art, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Maastricht Uiversity, Maastricht, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019-05-14", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
