This paper utilizes data generated by stylometric algorithms within the modeling application to visualize interactions and affinities, employing plays, playwrights, and theaters all as agents against a simple backdrop of Early Modern London. During whole-play analysis (WPA), though the title page of A Yorkshire Tragedy attributes authorship to Shakespeare, and first performance to the Globe, this model suggests that it certainly was not written by Shakespeare. Scene analysis (SA) of the play, employing scenes as independent agents, suggests that none of the scenes appear to be written by Shakespeare. In a Stylo© analysis of the plays reported to be first performed at the Globe theater, A Yorkshire Tragedy appears to be stylometrically similar to another anonymous play, The Merry Devil of Edmonton, and plays written by John Ford and John Webster. Further analysis with different stylometric dimensions may provide more clarity in answering this question.", "article_title": "A Yorkshire Tragedy: Using Agent-Based Modeling to Suggest Authorship", "authors": [{"given": "Brian J.", "family": "Kokensparger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2019-04-01", "keywords": ["corpus linguistics ", " textual analysis ", " stylometry ", " author attribution ", " Early Modern English drama "], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "3", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
