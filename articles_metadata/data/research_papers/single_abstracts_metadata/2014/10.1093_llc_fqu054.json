But how do these stories influence us, how do they persuade us to change our attitudes? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by providing a computational model that offers an internal perspective on character motives in stories. This model allows us to represent the deliberations of the main characters and how they weighed their values and motives given their attitudes. We illustrate out model by discussing the well known fable of the Ant and the Grasshopper and the parable of the Prodigal Son.", "article_title": "Arguments as a new perspective on character motive in stories", "authors": [{"given": " Floris", "family": "Bex", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Utrecht University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pp8hn57", "GRID": "grid.5477.1"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Liverpool", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04xs57h96", "GRID": "grid.10025.36"}}]}, {"given": " Katie", "family": "Atkinson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Utrecht University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pp8hn57", "GRID": "grid.5477.1"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Liverpool", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04xs57h96", "GRID": "grid.10025.36"}}]}, {"given": " Trevor", "family": "Bench-Capon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Utrecht University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pp8hn57", "GRID": "grid.5477.1"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Liverpool", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04xs57h96", "GRID": "grid.10025.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014-10-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
