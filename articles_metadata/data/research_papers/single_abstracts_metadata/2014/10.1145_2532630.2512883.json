The first proposal reconstructed is Louis Le Vau's 1662 scheme, the second is Gian Lorenzo Bernini's first design, and the third is the 1668 petit conseil design that still stands today. The results show how such reconstructions may aid both a general and an expert understanding of the three designs. It is proposed that by formalizing the facade description into a shape grammar with procedural modeling, a systematized approach to a stylistic analysis is possible. It is also asserted that such an analysis is still best understood within the historical context of what is known about the contemporary design intentions of the building creators and commissioners.", "article_title": "Using procedural modeling to explore alternative designs for the louvre", "authors": [{"given": "Erica", "family": "Calogero", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Brighton", "normalized_name": "University of Brighton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04kp2b655", "GRID": "grid.12477.37"}}]}, {"given": "Jaime", "family": "Kaminski", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Brighton", "normalized_name": "University of Brighton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04kp2b655", "GRID": "grid.12477.37"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Arnold", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Brighton", "normalized_name": "University of Brighton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04kp2b655", "GRID": "grid.12477.37"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2014-01-06", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "6", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
