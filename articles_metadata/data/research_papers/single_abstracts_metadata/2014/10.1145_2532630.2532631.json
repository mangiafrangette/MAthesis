The strong spatial dependence of this data suggests that the information should be linked to a 3D model of the artifact. This article presents a 3D information system that has been designed to manage cultural heritage information. The system allows information layers to be associated with the surface of the artifact, following an approach similar to that used in geographical information systems. This permits relationships between the different elements to be ascertained, and allows both specialists and the layperson to more easily understand the information. We describe here the structure and functionality of the system.", "article_title": "Design of cultural heritage information systems based on information layers", "authors": [{"given": "F.", "family": "Soler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Granada, Granada, Spain", "normalized_name": "University of Granada", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04njjy449", "GRID": "grid.4489.1"}}]}, {"given": "J.
