It is applied here to study the texts written jointly by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford, producing results that generally confirm the usual critical consensus on the visibility of the two author's hand. It also confirms that Ford's claims to a sizeable fragment in Nostromo are unfounded.", "article_title": "Collaborative authorship: Conrad, Ford and Rolling Delta", "authors": [{"given": " Jan", "family": "Rybicki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of English Studies, Jagiellonian University, Krak√≥w, Poland", "normalized_name": "Jagiellonian University", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03bqmcz70", "GRID": "grid.5522.0"}}]}, {"given": " David", "family": "Hoover", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, New York University, New York, NY, USA", "normalized_name": "New York University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0190ak572", "GRID": "grid.137628.9"}}]}, {"given": " Mike", "family": "Kestemont", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISLN/CLiPS, University of Antwerp, Belgium", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014-04-29", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
