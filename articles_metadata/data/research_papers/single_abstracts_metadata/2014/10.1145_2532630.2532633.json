This paper describes the initial steps of an attempt to design games for different places of cultural heritage and consists of three parts. In the first part, the descriptive model to be used as a classification method for games of different characteristics for cultural heritage sites is presented. In the second part, the model is used for the creation of different cultural heritage games. Finally, the third part presents a detailed case study of one of the developed games, showing the implementation and user testing processes as well as its efficiency in terms of education and visit motivation.", "article_title": "An approach for serious game development for cultural heritage", "authors": [{"given": "Angeliki", "family": "Antoniou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Peloponnese, Tripolis, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Peloponnese", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d4d3c02", "GRID": "grid.36738.39"}}]}, {"given": "George", "family": "Lepouras", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Peloponnese, Tripolis, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Peloponnese", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d4d3c02", "GRID": "grid.36738.39"}}]}, {"given": "Stavroula", "family": "Bampatzia", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Hera", "family": "Almpanoudi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2014-01-06", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "6", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
