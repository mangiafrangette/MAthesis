The focus is on the development of fundamental input mechanisms, which can be reused for specific metadata items. Our discussion results in the implementation of a proof-of-concept application, which shows that only a single text box is needed for each metadata item, without violating any of the self-imposed goals and requirements.", "article_title": "An optimized platform for capturing metadata of historical correspondence", "authors": [{"given": " Martin", "family": "Andert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Computer Science, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, D-06099 Halle (Saale), Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}, {"given": " Frank", "family": "Berger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Computer Science, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, D-06099 Halle (Saale), Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}, {"given": " Paul", "family": "Molitor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Computer Science, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, D-06099 Halle (Saale), Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}, {"given": " JÃ¶rg", "family": "Ritter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Computer Science, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, D-06099 Halle (Saale), Germany", "normalized_name": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05gqaka33", "GRID": "grid.9018.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014-06-27", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "30", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
