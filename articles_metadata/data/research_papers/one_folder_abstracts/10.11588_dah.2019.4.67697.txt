This essay explores the ways in which queer critical theory might be productively applied to digital art history and curatorial practice. Reflecting on a recent critically-acclaimed exhibition at the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), the author creates a theoretical framework of digital and aesthetic futurity that accords well with a curatorial exercise in visualizing queer affective networks on social media.
