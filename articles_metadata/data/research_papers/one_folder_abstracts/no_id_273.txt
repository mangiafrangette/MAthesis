 How can alternate histories of DH through feminist criticism, participatory art, and design shape undergraduate pedagogy in DH? In this article, we argue for explicitly employing a scholar-citizen model as a principle of pedagogical design, making explicit many of the latent assumptions of DH belonging and community. By adhering to these design principles we have been able to question some of the assumptions of pedagogical theories like Research Based Learning and public–facing scholarship, demonstrating these theories’ complex relationships public, semi–public, or private dissemination; classroom and non–classroom spaces; complexity of the assigned task; and the role of assessment. Our experiences as Director and Assistant Director for a combined Summer intensive undergraduate Field School in DH occasion this article.
