This article focuses on the iconography of Guillaume de Deguileville's Le pelerinage de vie humaine, first printed in its prose version in Lyon in 1485. The iconography here functions as a vehicle for the global identity of the text, ensuring the permanence of this identity over the process of translation. Henrich Mayer, a German printer and editor in Toulouse, preserved the iconography at the cost of adaptations and significant adjustments in the Castilian Peregrino de la vida humana, which was published in 1490. The editor treated the illustrations as the locus of textual filiation.
