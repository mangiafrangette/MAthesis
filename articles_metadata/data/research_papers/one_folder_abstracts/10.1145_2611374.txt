This article describes the evolution of an information system (IS) of Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza and the related interfaces from the first standalone on a CD-ROM system to the current web-based and georeferenced solution. The goal of these ISs was manifold: the dissemination, study, and analysis of architectural history. The IS was designed for many types of users. Mainly, we present the interface and the interaction techniques that were conceived and developed for large audiences during expositions, in the museum, or at home. This article presents a special focus on communicative language changes and on the level of information provided, which are determined by the different interfaces adopted over time.
