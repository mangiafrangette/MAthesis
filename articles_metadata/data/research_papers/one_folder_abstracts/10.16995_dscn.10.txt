This chapter extends from research on the genealogies of modernist laboratories (aesthetic, scientific, and corporate) and their relationship to the formation of contemporary digital-humanities and new-media laboratories and collaboratories. The trajectory of this project, broadly conceived, leads from the modular principles of early twentieth-century industrial design and avant-garde aesthetics, to the implementation of modular architecture in the construction of mid-century corporate science labs, to the modularization of markup languages, interoperable digital tools, and collaborative and cross-disciplinary lab environments in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In doing so, I traverse the conjuncture of multiple modularities and disciplinarities—from architecture, art, and industrial design to markup languages, source code, and digital tools—in the historical contexts of cultural, industrial, and postindustrial modernities.
