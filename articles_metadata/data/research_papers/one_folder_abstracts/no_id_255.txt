 In this article, we discuss a way for visualizing interactions or solidarities in a past community. The method that we expound is derived from process-oriented views used in the industry. Therefore, this attempt to adopt practices from outside of the traditional humanities framework must be clearly justified in terms of epistemological position and in terms of choice among the numerous available tools. First, we try to define what the process term could mean in the humanities; then we explain our choice of a representation; we also carry out tests of our method on selected case studies to visualize and question scholarly works. Last, we offer the reader a prototype that must be improved to produce automatic visualization of particular situations.
