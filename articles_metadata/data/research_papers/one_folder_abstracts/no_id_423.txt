If we were to apply probably the most typical intertextual slogan to games and try to model our approach to them highlighting the idea that a game is a mosaic of other games, we are on the verge of seeing what's missing both from video game theories and the actual scholarly practice not to mention methodology. In short, how should we handle the complex co-presences, imitations, implementations, adaptations and transformations between and among different rule systems, goals, quest structures, tasks, challenges and obstacles, player representations, resources, non-playing characters, game worlds, game engines and platforms etc.? This is the conceptual territory this paper tries to begin to chart by crafting and exploring a general game ecology and its multiple relations to other transmedial modes and entertainment ecologies that also shape and affect individual games.
