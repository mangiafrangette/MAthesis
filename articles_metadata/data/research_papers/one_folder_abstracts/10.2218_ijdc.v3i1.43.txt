The OAIS concept of Representation Information (RI) is a potential strategy for the curation and preservation of all types of information. We share insights gained from our exploration of issues concerned with the capture of crystallography and engineering RI as well as its structuring, collection and curation. In addition, we discuss the supporting technical, IPR and globally collaborative infrastructures required to make such a strategy successful.
