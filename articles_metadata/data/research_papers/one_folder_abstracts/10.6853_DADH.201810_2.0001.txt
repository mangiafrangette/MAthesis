This paper proposes an alternative take to critique in the digital humanities (DH). As it further expands, the DH needs to critically engage with digital technologies by shifting the balance between the thinking and methods of the humanities. Taking the standpoint of a humanist enterprise, the DH ought to examine materiality as the essence of the digital. In so doing it should engage with the subjective experience as a starting point of analysis about how the digital impacts the nature of who we are, and in turn the way in which it affects culture and digital practices.
