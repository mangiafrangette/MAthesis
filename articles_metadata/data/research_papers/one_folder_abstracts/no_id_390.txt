The article gives an overview about digitization activities from a German prospective. The setup of a specialized funding program for retrospective digitization of library holdings by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in 1997 played an important role for inciting and promoting digitization projects. Giving direct access to broadly used research and teaching materials or facilitating the use of rare and precious documents are some of the most frequent selection criterias. The main lines of digitization activities of the Bavarian State Library are given as an example for building a digitization profile which is reflecting the missions of the library. Further American and French initiatives are cited in order to illustrate digitization programs of much greater dimensions. The second part of the article refers to the basic technical questions (scanners, resolution, text encoding) and also mentions some copyright issues.
