E‐CITIES is a concept for a system that would bring research knowledge of the cultural heritage, in particular the history of cities, into popular use. The idea was developed as a model of multilingual cultural content management and dissemination. The system could be implemented as a fully functional and reproducible system applicable to any city, anywhere. Much of the technology is being or has been developed for use in other applications. E‐CITIES would offer important political, economic, and cultural benefits. This paper explores the technologies that would be required and identifies those that are available and developing. It puts the case that an E‐CITIES system is not just desirable but, increasingly, necessary.
