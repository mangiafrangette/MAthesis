This essay examines how Dominicans focused their late fourteenth-century struggle to redefine spirituality around the cults of St. Thomas and St. Catherine of Siena. The relics of the Angelic Doctor were translated from the Cistercian abbey of Fossanova to Toulouse in 1369 through the efforts of French Dominican Master, Elias Raymundus. However, the translation was then countered by Raymond of Capua through the active promotion of the much more affective spirituality of Catherine of Siena. The contest came to a head when Raymond overthrew Elias Raymundus as Master of the Order at the General Chapter of Pentecost in 1380, just after the death of Catherine of Siena at thirty-three. Catherineâ€™s intensely emotional style of spiritual writing is much more closely connected to her understanding of the influence of Thomas Aquinas than often realised and its promotion by Raymond of Capua marks a shift away from a purely cerebral approach to theology.
