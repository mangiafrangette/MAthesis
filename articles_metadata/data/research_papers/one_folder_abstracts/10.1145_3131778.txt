In this article, we address the problem of 3D inpainting using an exemplar-based method for point clouds. 3D inpainting is a process of filling holes or missing regions in the reconstructed 3D models. Typically, inpainting methods addressed in the literature fill missing regions due to occlusions or inaccurate scanning of 3D models. However, we focus on scenarios involving naturally existing damaged models, which are partly broken or incomplete in the artifacts at cultural heritage sites. We propose an exemplar-based inpainting technique using the region of interest (ROI)-based method to inpaint the missing regions of the damaged model. The ROI of a 3D model is represented as a set of Riemannian manifolds, and metric tensor and Christoffel symbols are used as geometric features to capture the inherent geometry. We then decompose the ROI into basic shape regions, namely, spherical, conical, and cylindrical components, and identify the best-fit match for inpainting. Instead of using a single similar exemplar for inpainting, we select the most relevant best-fit region to fill the missing region from the basic shape regions library obtained from n similar exemplars. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed inpainting method on artifacts at UNESCO World Heritage site Hampi temples, India with varying complexities and sizes for both synthetically generated holes and real missing regions in 3D objects.
