In his seminal work l'Emile Rousseau asked his female reader to educate her daughter so that she would become a 'honnête femme' and not a 'honnête homme'. Rousseau was playing on words as the collocation 'honnête homme' refers to a social and intellectual ideal reserved for the masculine gender, whereas the 'honnêteté' described in 'honnête femme' refers to the loyalty of a spouse vis-à-vis her husband. This different meaning of an adjective when it qualifies the noun femme or the noun homme is found in other collocations in French, for instance a grand homme is a "great man" but a grande femme is "a tall woman". This lexical and semantic dissymmetry is the topic of this essay. I make the hypothesis that the differential meaning can be explained by the systematic derogation of the noun femme; therefore, in the case of the syntagms with a differential meaning the noun modifies to a certain extent the adjective. Computerized databases and on-line texts provide the much-needed data to examine this assumed phenomenon of derogation of the noun femme. I also remark upon the usage of some women writers. Female writers tend to use more positive adjectives with the word woman. Also female writers such as de Navarre and Sévigné use adjectives with the 'male (and positive) meaning' when referring to women and not the 'female (and negative) meaning'.
