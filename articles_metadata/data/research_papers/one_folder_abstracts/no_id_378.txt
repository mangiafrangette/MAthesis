 This essay presents quantitative capture and predictive modeling for one of the largest and longest running mass reading programs of the past two decades: One Book One Chicago (OBOC) sponsored by the Chicago Public Library (CPL). The Reading Chicago Reading project uses data associated with OBOC as a probe into city-scale library usage and, by extension, as a window onto contemporary reading behavior. The first half of the essay explains why CPLâ€™s OBOC program is conducive for modeling purposes, and the second half documents the creation of our models, their underlying data, and the results.
