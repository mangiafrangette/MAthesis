The Virtual Library for German Studies (ViFa Germanistik) is being developed at the University Library of Frankfurt/Main in cooperation with Deutscher Germanistenverband, Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach and with a group of German specialists. Intended as a central portal for German Studies, it will offer access not only to the fully integrated OPAC, containing both conventional and electronic media, but also to links with selective qualified information/internet resources. In addition, ViFa Germanistik will integrate a communication site allowing comprehensive orientation on scholarly and organizational matters.
