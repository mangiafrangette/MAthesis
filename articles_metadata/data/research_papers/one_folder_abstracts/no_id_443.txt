Digital methods are essential for production, revision and publication of philological editions. The TEI-guidelines for XML coding are considered an approved standard for the representation of literary texts. The research group responsible for publishing Karl Ferdinand Gutzkow’s (1811–1878) dramatic works and the Institute of Computer Science – both located at the Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany – are working together on a configurable platform that simplifies and automates the work of editors. The product of this cooperation is KRONOS, a TEI-conform platform supporting drama edition[1]. The tool offers a GUI adapted to the structure of drama, XML-encoding that is as easy as formatting text even without knowledge of XML/TEI, and the extraction of publication formats (HTML, PDF) at the push of a button.
