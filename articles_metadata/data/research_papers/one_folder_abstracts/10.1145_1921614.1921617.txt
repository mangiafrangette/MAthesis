Exhibits within cultural heritage collections such as museums and art galleries are arranged by experts with intimate knowledge of the domain, but there may exist connections between individual exhibits that are not evident in this representation. For example, the visitors to such a space may have their own opinions on how exhibits relate to one another. In this article, we explore the possibility of estimating the perceived relatedness of exhibits by museum visitors through a variety of ontological and document similarity-based methods. Specifically, we combine the Wikipedia category hierarchy with lexical similarity measures, and evaluate the correlation with the relatedness judgements of visitors. We compare our measure with simple document similarity calculations, based on either Wikipedia documents or Web pages taken from the Web site for the museum of interest. We also investigate the hypothesis that physical distance in the museum space is a direct representation of the conceptual distance between exhibits. We demonstrate that ontological similarity measures are highly effective at capturing perceived relatedness and that the proposed RACO (Related Article Conceptual Overlap) method is able to achieve results closest to relatedness judgements provided by human annotators compared to existing state-of-the art measures of semantic relatedness.
