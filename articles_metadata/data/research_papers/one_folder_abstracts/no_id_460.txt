Up to now, Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival, one of the most important texts of Middle High German literature, hasn’t been accessible but in one edition, which is over 170 years old and thus follows editorial principles that are by now outdated. Hence, in 2001, the Parzival-Project, currently settled at the University of Berne, was grounded to present a new edition that would visualize the plurality of manuscript transmission by applying modern computer technology. The edition is based on digital transcriptions that are annotated according to a specifically developed markup-system. Due to the fact that the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) have become a standard for the annotation of digital editions it would be desirable to transform the Bernese project material into the TEI-code. The paper demonstrates what methods can be used to convert the data, and what problems might occur in the transformation process.
