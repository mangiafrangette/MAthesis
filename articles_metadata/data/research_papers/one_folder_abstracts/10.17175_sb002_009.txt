Using an examination of the orthography of a print by the printer Georg Stüchs from 1508, this paper demonstrates how modern digital editions can be used for historio-linguistic research. After an overview of the letters/graphemes and abbreviations used by the print shop, this analysis concentrates on the following aspects: the spelling of diphthongs and of /œ, ø:/ und /ʏ, y:/; writing variations for /ɪ, i:/, /ʊ, u:/, /f/ und /t/; the distribution of the letters &lt;S, ſ, ß, s&gt;; and the capitalization of nouns. By comparing the text [A]bschrieffte eines Sandtbriefes with a contemporary print of the same text published independently, also attributed to Georg Stüchs, this paper explores the extent to which the language of a printer’s workshop can be considered homogeneous.
