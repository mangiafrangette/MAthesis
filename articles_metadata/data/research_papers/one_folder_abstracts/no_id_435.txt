The aim of this paper is to show up ways in which the practice, or rather practices, of cheating can be integrated into the work of game researchers. Apart from the obvious ways, in which cheats can be employed, exempli grati as time-savers, it is my intention to demonstrate how cheating can actually add to our understanding of games. To this end, I study the areas of game analysis, genre, and games culture. In all these examples, I attempt to point to ways in which the practice of cheating can not only make us understand the things we already see, but also enable us to see things that have escaped our attention so far.
