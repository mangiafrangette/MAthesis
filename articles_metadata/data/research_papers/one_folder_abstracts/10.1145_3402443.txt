We investigate the overlapping of the concepts of prestige and success in art. To this end, we invited a group of art experts and a group of artists to select a small number of artworks that they deemed of high quality among those the crypto art gallery SuperRare displays. We then matched the selections with indicators of market success for the same artworks. We find that prestigious artworks selected by art experts and artists are also successful in the gallery marketplace, tracing an interesting link between prestige and success in the art context. We also observe a clear divergence between the roles of art expert and art maker (artist).
