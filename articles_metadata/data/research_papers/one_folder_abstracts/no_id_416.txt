This paper describes plans for a diachronic corpus of German, which contains texts from Old High German to Modern German. In order to serve as a resource for research questions from many different fields (linguistics, literature, lexicography et cetera) the corpus must have a flexible architecture as well as a high degree of standardization of content. This flexibility is possible through a multi-layer standoff corpus model where the texts are stored in a central database. Standardization is ensured through common tagsets on each annotation level.
