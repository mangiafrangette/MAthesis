Spatiality – the topographical distribution of text on the manuscript page – represents one of the central aspects of the epistolographical ›material text‹. In contrast to a diplomatic-mimetic text reproduction, the C.F.Meyer edition distinguishes between significant (structural) vs. meaningless (contingent) spatiality. The contribution reflects the theoretical foundations and implications of this concept in the context of the current materiality debate in textual scholarship and presents a solution for the implementation of the philological model in TEI.
