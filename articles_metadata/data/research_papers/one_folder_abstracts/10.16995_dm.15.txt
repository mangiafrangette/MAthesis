This paper considers the application of image-processing and data-mining to the analysis of scribal hands. The work of forensic document analysts on feature-extraction is considered, particularly the algorithms developed for automatic handwriting-recognition by Srihari, and by Bulacu and Schomaker. Automatic clustering is also considered using the AutoClass package. Preliminary results of the authorâ€™s own experiments with these approaches are presented, and some of the obstacles are outlined which must be overcome before a practical system can be developed for the automatic identification of medieval scribes.
