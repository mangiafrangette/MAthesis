This essay argues two points concerning the systematic use of the protagonists' dreams in the fifteenth-century romance Paris et Vienne, focusing on the single manuscript composed at the Burgundian Court during the 1450s, the base MS for the new edition of de Cr√©cy and Brown-Grant. First, it argues that these dreams form a coherent, important program in the work as a whole, directly linked to the structure of its narrative. Secondly, it argues that this program functions in part by referring to a similar oneiric program in the thirteenth-century Roman de la Rose, in terms of the (ambiguous) meaning of dreams as fictional discourse.
