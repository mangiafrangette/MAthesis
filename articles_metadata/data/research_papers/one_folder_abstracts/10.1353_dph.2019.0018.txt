This article tracks the global trajectories of a tale of a scholarly slave girl (her name in Arabic is Tawaddud) who wins a knowledge contest over the greatest scholars of her time. This essay investigates what made the tale so gripping to its medieval readers and translators: its uncoupling of knowledge from mastery. I use Deleuze's and DeLanda's discussions of assemblage theory to consider how Arabic versions of the tale link heterogeneous fields and genres of knowledge into a fantasy of feminine, enslaved omnicompetence, and also how the tales' global transmigrations create a network of multifaceted and larger-than-Eurocentric research, informed but not deliminated by colonialism and decolonization.
