In this paper, we present a system performing morphological analysis and synthesis for the Greek language. Its main features are the use of a single framework to describe and classify morphological data into well-defined classes characterized by their own set of properties and mechanisms and the structuring of the database into distinct levels corresponding to the different levels of morphological information present in the above framework. The resulting system is characterized by simple and flexible algorithms with 100% success in the recognition and generation of morphological forms of the language independently of the complexity of the data they are handling.
