This article attempts to analyze the definition of "electronic literature" as given by the Electronic Literature Organization and to understand the relationship between electronic literature and digital literature. The thesis defended here is that this change of adjective hides a change in the theoretical status of the object that it attempts to define. The definition of electronic literature once concentrated on the tools used in the production of literary works and the critical analysis concentrating on the objects produced with the aid of new technologies. The move to the adjective "digital" marks a change in perception: now, from this perspective, the challenge is no longer to study works produced thanks to computers, but to understand the new status of literature in the age of the digital. To demonstrate this thesis, the article proposes to analyze one recent literary example: the 1984 trilogy by Eric Plamondon.
