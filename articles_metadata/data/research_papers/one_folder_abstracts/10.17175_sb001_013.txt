Theory-driven research in the social sciences is confronting the Digital Humanities with new challenges. Here, text analysis can not be built directly on linguistic features, but rather the research questions require access to more complex concepts and their meaning. Our methodological contribution to DH argues that it is possible to develop hermeneutically sensitive methods for corpus analysis when the tool components remain transparent for the target discipline and allow for interactive exploration of the underlying data. We provide an overview of interactive tools for text processing and analysis that can be flexibly adjusted to specific disciplinary theories and research questions in the target disciplines, with an underlying architecture that is generic and therefore broadly applicable.
