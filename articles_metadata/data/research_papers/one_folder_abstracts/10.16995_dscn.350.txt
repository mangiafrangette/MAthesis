BretezÂ is a cooperative science project linking the humanities and the engineering sciences (digital humanities) whose prime purpose is museography. Its objective, the patrimonial valorisation through its three-dimensional digital restoration and spatial sound restoration, sets itself apart with its new approach to the restoration of the past by combining the 3D with a prominent acoustic aspect that makes the past available and tangible for a very wide audience. This presentation of my work (research focus: archeology of soundscapes) draws on the model that acts as a research template and focuses more specifically on the rendition of soundscapes, while proposing the following question: how can we interpret the past in order to delight our senses without misrepresenting History?
