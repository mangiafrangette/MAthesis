 A year-long project to investigate the use of digital technologies in prosopographical research resulted in the creation of intermediary objects (called ‘factoids’) within the database to model the multiple relationships possible among elite medieval landholders. These factoids facilitated a modular approach to database development, whereas a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) allowed flexible and speedy data entry. GIS provided a mapping function via Web Map Services.
