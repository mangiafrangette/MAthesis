The Goethezeitportal has been developed on the initiative of a team based at the Institute of German Literature at the university of Munich. It is a tool that can be used for the innovative processing and dissemination of knowledge by applying the possibilities offered by the new media to the cultural and scientific discourse on the most significant phase in the history of German intellectual history between 1770 and 1830. Further information on the concept, mission and current activities of the portal is available below.
