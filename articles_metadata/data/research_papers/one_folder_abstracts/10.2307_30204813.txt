The paper examines the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) critically and compares it with Part of Speech (POS) tagging, arguing that the ability of a writer to create new senses distinguishes the tasks and makes it more problematic to test WSD by the mark-up-and-model paradigm, because new senses cannot be marked up against dictionaries. This serves to set WSD apart and puts limits on its effectiveness as an independent NLP task. Moreover, it is argued that current WSD methods based on very small word samples are also potentially misleading because they may or may not scale up. Since all-word WSD methods are now available and are producing figures comparable to the smaller scale tasks, it is argued that we should concentrate on the former and find ways of bootstrapping test materials for such tests in the future.
