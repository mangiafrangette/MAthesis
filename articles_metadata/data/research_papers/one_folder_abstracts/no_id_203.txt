 As Matthew K. Gold acknowledges in his introduction to Debates in the Digital Humanities, there are some gaps, some preferred object orientations, if you will, in the digital humanities. Many of us and our work fall into these gaps, cracks, and in some cases, void space. This work is not intended to indict the two collections examined here, Debates in the Digital Humanities and Companion to Digital Humanities, and in fact I am represented in Debates in a piece entitled, This Digital Humanities That Is Not One. The piece at hand intends, rather, to apply a basic computational humanities method, frequency of keyword occurrence, to bring to the surface what is and what is not visible or embodied across the scope of digital humanisms.
