This chapter examines the various textual traditions that inform the design and affordances of three INKE digital tools, namely NewRadial, the Dynamic Table of Contexts, and Bubblelines. In turning to earlier textual exemplars, such as the sammelb√§nde and foldout engravings, the chapter illustrates certain commonalities between past and present textual media. Similarly, by examining the material evidence of Renaissance readers, including manuscript tables of contents and supplements to print indexes, the chapter considers the long history of customization that lies behind many of our digital applications today. In short, the chapter invites readers to situate a series of INKE tools within a much earlier and seemingly unrelated textual tradition.
