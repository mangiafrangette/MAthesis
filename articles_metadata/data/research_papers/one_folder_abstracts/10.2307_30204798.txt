We describe a simple approach to word sense disambiguation using information filtering and extraction. The method fully exploits and extends the information available in the Hector dictionary. The algorithm proceeds by the application of several filters to prune the candidate set of word senses returning the most frequent if more than one remains. The experimental methodology and its implication are also discussed.
