To qualify materials for specific applications comprehensive testing is necessary, and consequently the engineering materials community has developed an extensive collection of documentary testing standards to define test conditions, specimen configurations, and post processing and reporting procedures. Unfortunately, in the absence of corresponding data formats, test results are rarely conserved and their value diminishes as the material pedigree, test conditions, and results become disassociated. In an effort to address this issue, prenormative research has demonstrated the viability of deriving data formats from documentary testing standards and thus the possibility to realize a standards-based data infrastructure for the engineering materials community.
