 The popularity of information visualization in academia and practice brings a renewed emphasis on aesthetic values and visual applications to ensure its appeal to a wider audience. This paper focuses on visualization aesthetics and perception by making the case for using graphic design techniques and design languages to understand and create more aesthetically pleasant and functionally effective information design and visualization. It uses cross-disciplinary reviews of background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design principles and methods in the realm of visualization education. A user-centered design framework and student projects are discussed by adapting graphic design elements into the visualization process. It shows that the practice of developing a visualization should be executed with an understanding of graphic design basics in mind, and with a balanced consideration of tangible and conditional design elements, as well as how these design elements fulfill the purpose of the objective, context, content, audience, and the knowledge of the design outcomes.
