The academy-edition of Immanuel Kant’s writings is the general reference edition for philological and philosophical investigation concerning Immanuel Kant. The first three sections (works, correspondence and handwritten remains) have been digitized and serve as the basis for an electronic edition which is freely available at <http://www.ikp.uni-bonn.de/kant>. The fourth section (lectures) is still work in progress. In this paper, we describe the academy-edition, the electronic edition and the computer-assisted edition of the lectures. We explicate problems regarding the arrangement and documentation of Kant’s texts, and – in this context – we explain the importance of hyperlinking texts and other documents for the proper editing and interpretation.
