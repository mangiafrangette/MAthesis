 Using DIAS and DENDRON, computer applications designed for the study of infectious fungi and cancer cells, we forge a connection in color, composition, and theme between Paolo Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana and Paul Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux. From this connection, we bring to light a hidden compositional structure, heretofore unidentified, in Cézanne’s Bathers as a series. Using computer-assisted systems such as DIAS and DENDRON allowed us to detect relatedness in these paintings not necessarily visible to the human eye. With DIAS and DENDRON, we generated dendrograms that clustered paintings related in brightness, saturation, complexity, and color. After studying color, we applied DIAS to the study of Cézanne’s composition. Because Cézanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding paintings in his conversations and letters, we programmed DIAS to compute axial lines and golden sections according to the dimensions of the square or rectangular painting under scrutiny. Using DIAS we identified the golden rectangle for Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana, Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux and Ingres’ La Source (another likely model for Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux). From the similarities and differences between the three paintings we identified, regarding their use of axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated a new approach to seeing Cézanne’s composition in his Bather series.   Cézanne’s noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as awkward and composed with baffling imbalance, we can now see as golden.
