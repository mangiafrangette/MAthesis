Medieval and early modern account books are well suited for computer analysis, since they can be easily converted to tabullar data formats. Scholarly research and the creation of critical editions have simultaneously demonstrated that research interest on this type of textual material is so diverse that they should ideally be digitally edited. However, this paper can only point to one single digital edition that also allows the numeric analysis of account books. While previous research on digital editions has concentrated on philologic and paleographic problems, this paper proposes an edition model that also includes the contents of the accounts themselves. Based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), this model of references between the different forms of representation can be serialized with the encoding guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Finally, this paper will demonstrate that extensive collections can also be efficiently be digitally edited in this way.
