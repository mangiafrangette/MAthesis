Austria has a unique manuscript landscape in the German-speaking world, characterized both by the high number of surviving medieval manuscripts relative to its population, and by the survival of monastic libraries, which were not affected by the secularization that took place in German lands in 1806. This article surveys the range of scholarly projects in Austria that deal with medieval German texts and their online presentation, with a particular focus on the role of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and its Department of Paleography and Codicology, and the research portal manuscripta.at.
