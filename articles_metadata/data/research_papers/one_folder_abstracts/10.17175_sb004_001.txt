This paper builds a bridge between XML and graphing technologies to examine references in a historical body of text, and explores the extent to which graph queries can facilitate the analysis of referentiality, considering fuzzy information in particular. Examples are chosen form a history research project which examines music critiques of the 19th century on the Messa da Requiem by Giuseppe Verdi.
