New technologies and methodologies in the digital humanities can help alleviate some limitations inherent in the traditional methods of creating and publishing critical editions, especially how typical practices privilege major texts and create an artificial version of a text that obscures its textual history. I argue that those who work with manuscripts should place a greater emphasis on creating digital noncritical editions that will capture traditionally lost transcription work, harness community expertise, and create a vast interdisciplinary textual archive. This article describes some key benefits of a Platonic web-based transcription tool that will encourage large-scale collaborative transcription and editing in order to make manuscripts much more visible, accessible, connectable, correctable, and usable.
