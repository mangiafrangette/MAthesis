Whereas editors of printed collections of historical sources have to decide whether to create a critical edition for a scientific audience or one for a wider audience, which is easier to read, digital editions have the potential to combine high standards of textual criticism with a high degree of readability. By means of an edition of primary sources on the 1968 movement in Zurich, Switzerland, the article introduces the utilization of XML as tool for the creation of dynamic documents. The application allows the user to switch between different modes of the representation of the sources ranging from a plain to a critically edited text with facsimile. Moreover, XML can be very useful for structuring and arranging large amounts of texts and present them in different modes. XML is thus an ideal markup language for critical editions, although minor problems concerning the processing of large data sets must be dealt with. The article illustrates, how XML and XSLT are put into practice. On the one hand XSLT is used to dynamically produce different views on the sources of the edition. On the other hand XSLT extracts meta information from the data to get the various indices and tables of content. By these means the edition organizes its source documents in different ways to ease the access for the users.
