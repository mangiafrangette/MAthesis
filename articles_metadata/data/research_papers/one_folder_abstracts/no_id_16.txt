Personification in Ovid's Metamorphoses (understood grammatically, as phenomena created by discernible operations in language) provides a typical problem for the application of computational modelling techniques. An earlier systematic attempt to encode these personifications was described in A.24 as “modelling”. In this paper the result, rather more a phenomenological description than a model, properly so-called, is taken as the basis for construction of a manipulable model. Instances of the abstract entity “fortuna” (fortune, luck, chance) are used to build a relational database of examples. For each example the causative factors are specified; wherever possible these factors are weighted globally to signify their degree of influence on the result. This database is linked to spreadsheet software to generate a chart of these instances in bar-graph format from a formula that computes the total effect of the causative factors. A mathematical function is provisionally introduced to provide more realistic results. Its limitations and directions for further research are discussed.
