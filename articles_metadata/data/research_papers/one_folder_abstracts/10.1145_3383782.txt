This work illustrates the use of three different digitization techniques to study and valorize a 15th-century engraved tablet discovered during a preventive archaeological excavation in the area of a former convent. The tablet is covered with engraved inscriptions on both sides and includes a musical score. Digitization allowed for an advanced analysis of the inscriptions, and to generate a complete and precise 3D model of the artifact that was used to produce an interactive application deployed both on tactile tablets and websites. The interactive application integrates a musical interpretation of the score that gives access to a testimony of intangible heritage. This interdisciplinary work gathered archaeologists, researchers from computer science and physics, and a professional musician.
