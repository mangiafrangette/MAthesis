The multifaceted history of digital art has also entailed an evolution of understanding the complex relationships between the material and immaterial in the digital medium. This text traces the histories of digital objects and systems from the 1960s to the so-called ‘post-digital’ era, which finds its artistic expression in works shaped by digital technologies and networks, yet taking the material form of objects such as paintings, sculptures, or photographs. The term neomateriality is used here to capture an objecthood that reflects back the data of humans and the environment, or reveals the way in which digital processes perceive and shape our world. Digital materialities are considered in relation to network cultures and politics, as well as art institutions.
