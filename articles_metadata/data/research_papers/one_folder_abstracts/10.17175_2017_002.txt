Who is cleverer, man or machine? Since the 1950s, the answer to this question has been linked to Alan Turing and the Turing test he devised. This paper builds upon this foundation with its comparison of two analyses of a historical collection of correspondence: one created by humans using ›close reading‹ and the application of subject terms, and one generated by machines with the help of topic modeling. In addition to concrete evaluation of the topic modeling process, this paper investigates whether, and, if so, to what extent, it is feasible and justifiable to use methods that can hardly be understood without in-depth knowledge of probability calculations and statistics.
