 Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This loose hold on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a true distraction, and managed accordingly. In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text, image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholarâ€™s understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes tenuous, and largely undiscovered. This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of epistemic emotions as a valid research input, but also to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment might be and how to get below the level of that work.
