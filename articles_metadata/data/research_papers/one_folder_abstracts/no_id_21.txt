Building an Internet resource for the Native American language East Cree for the last four years has been full of challenges and rewards. We focus here on the technical challenges in order to discuss both the problems encountered in this particular context and the solutions we have considered and explored. We illustrate our discussion with examples from an Oral Stories Database we developed in collaboration with Cree education consultants and speakers in 2002-2004. We advocate an approach that includes fast-prototyping, open-source development, and database engine design that balances speed, availability, features and resources.
