Web archiving initiatives around the world capture ephemeral Web content to preserve our collective digital memory. However, unlocking the potential of Web archives for humanities scholars and social scientists requires a scalable analytics infrastructure to support exploration of captured content. We present Warcbase, an open-source Web archiving platform that aims to fill this need. Our platform takes advantage of modern open-source “big data” infrastructure, namely Hadoop, HBase, and Spark, that has been widely deployed in industry. Warcbase provides two main capabilities: support for temporal browsing and a domain-specific language that allows scholars to interrogate Web archives in several different ways. This work represents a collaboration between computer scientists and historians, where we have engaged in iterative codesign to build tools for scholars with no formal computer science training. To provide guidance, we propose a process model for scholarly interactions with Web archives that begins with a question and proceeds iteratively through four main steps: filter, analyze, aggregate, and visualize. We call this the FAAV cycle for short and illustrate with three prototypical case studies. This article presents the current state of the project and discusses future directions.
