 Recent developments in the storage industry have resulted in the creation of an industry standard application programmerâ€™s interface (API) known as XAM, the eXtensible Access Method. The XAM API focuses on the creation and management of reference information (otherwise known as fixed content). Storage vendors supporting the XAM API will provide new benefits to applications that are creating and managing large amounts of fixed content. The benefits described by this paper merit consideration and research by developers creating applications for Digital Curators.
