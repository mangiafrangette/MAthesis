This essay addresses the reception of the New Philology, and its more recent iteration, material philology, in German medieval studies. Whereas the New Philology elicited a largely skeptical response from practitioners of textual criticism and editorial philology, approaches informed by cultural studies have been more open to a constructive engagement with its tenets. Nevertheless, the question remains open as to whether German medieval studies have really followed the lead given by material philology and placed the manuscript as a physical object at the center of research to the extent that is often claimed.
