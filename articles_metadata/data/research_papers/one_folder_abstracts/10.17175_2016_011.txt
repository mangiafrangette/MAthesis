In the Digital Humanities, the dominant belief is that the use of generic ›tools‹ could or should serve as a bridge between the different disciplines and their methodologies. Differences in cognitive interests and in hermeneutics between literary studies and history are too easily overlooked, and therefore both disciplines require the use of adapted and specialized digital tools. This paper investigates the hermeneutic suitability of current digital methods for the humanities and demonstrates their applicability by means of three examples: digital handwriting recognition, historical network analysis, and historical semantics informed by computational linguistics.
