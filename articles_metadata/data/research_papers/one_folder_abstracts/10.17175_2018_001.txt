The Perthes collection represents the survival of one of the few completely preserved archives of a cartographic publisher. This publishing house significantly contributed to the scientific exploration, mapping, and surveying of the earth in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In addition to the maps as end products, the collection contains unique and closely interconnected archival materials that document the process of mapping and map-making at all stages. The following article presents a new prototype of a virtual map laboratory that was developed in the first project phase, which will allow these materials to be studied within the context of their different connections.
