 This paper explores a method for creating large-scale urban 3D models using Historical GIS data. The method is capable of automatically generating realistic VR models based on GIS data at a low cost. 3D models of houses are created from polygon data, fences from line data, and pedestrians and trees from point data. The method is applied to the Virtual Kyoto Project in which the landscape of the whole city of Kyoto of the early Edo era (ca 17C) is reconstructed.
