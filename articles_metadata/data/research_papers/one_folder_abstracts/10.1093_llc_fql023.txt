Ever since its initial publication four hundred years ago, thousands of editions, most often illustrated, have been published of Cervantes' masterpiece, Don Quixote. Imagery has become an integral part of the reception and interpretation of the text. To date, a comprehensive collection of these images, the textual iconography of the Quixote, has not been published. We report in this paper on overcoming two key obstacles: limitations on the availability of materials and limitations due to the technical and financial characteristics of print-based dissemination. Our digital iconography makes a rich artistic tradition accessible to readers for the first time, and reveals a wealth of information about the historical, cultural, and literary contexts into which the Quixote has been placed.
