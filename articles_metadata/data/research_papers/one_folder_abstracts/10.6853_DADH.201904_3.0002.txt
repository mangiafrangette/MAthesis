In this paper, A Yorkshire Tragedy (AYT) is used as a focus for development of an agent-based modeling application, using a Java swarm-type modeling library called Mason. This paper utilizes data generated by stylometric algorithms within the modeling application to visualize interactions and affinities, employing plays, playwrights, and theaters all as agents against a simple backdrop of Early Modern London. During whole-play analysis (WPA), though the title page of A Yorkshire Tragedy attributes authorship to Shakespeare, and first performance to the Globe, this model suggests that it certainly was not written by Shakespeare. Scene analysis (SA) of the play, employing scenes as independent agents, suggests that none of the scenes appear to be written by Shakespeare. In a StyloÂ© analysis of the plays reported to be first performed at the Globe theater, A Yorkshire Tragedy appears to be stylometrically similar to another anonymous play, The Merry Devil of Edmonton, and plays written by John Ford and John Webster. Further analysis with different stylometric dimensions may provide more clarity in answering this question.
