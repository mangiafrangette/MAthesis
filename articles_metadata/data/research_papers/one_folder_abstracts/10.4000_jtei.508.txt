This paper describes work in progress on I5, a TEI-based document grammar for the corpus holdings of the Institut f√ºr Deutsche Sprache (IDS) in Mannheim and the text model used by IDS in its work.  The paper begins with background information on the nature and purposes of the corpora collected at IDS and the motivation for the I5 project (section 1).  It continues with a description of the origin and history of the IDS text model (section 2), and a description (section 3) of the techniques used to automate, as far as possible, the preparation of the ODD file documenting the IDS text model.  It ends with some concluding remarks (section 4). A survey of the additional features of the IDS-XCES realization of the IDS text model is given in an appendix.
