 Over a decade ago, the Collaboratory for GIS and Mediterranean (CGMA) was created with two stated goals: (1) to create an on-line GIS inventory of survey projects in the greater Mediterranean and Europe and (2) to introduce advanced undergraduates to GIS concepts through Mediterranean archaeology. Through a specialized GIS course a small group of advanced undergraduate students learned how to interpret map data, create effective maps, and build map hypothesis - skills that are recognized as necessary for enhancing spatial thinking and thus spatial literacy. In the last decade GIS technologically has changed dramatically. The advent of Geospatial Semantic Web (Web 2.0) now makes it possible to integrate spatial thinking concepts at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum. This paper argues that spatial literacy must be more intentionally integrated into the Classical Studies curriculum and illustrates how we have begun to do that at DePauw University.
