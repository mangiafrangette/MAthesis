Determination of authorship, using methods such as those of Mosteller and Wallace, has been obliquely criticized by literary scholars for years. However, the most radical critique of these methods has, under the umbrella term ‘theory’, emerged since the 1960s in the writings of Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida. Thanks to their influence, authorship attribution is now distinguished from authorship ascription with only the latter applying to literary and linguistic computing. Various criticisms are examined in detail. Useful as these criticisms are, the philosophical roots of the postmodernist critiques are destructive of any attempt to discover who wrote what.
