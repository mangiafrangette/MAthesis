In 2016, a software developer named David and I met to discuss creating a quan titative demographic survey of the open source software community to which we were both long-time contributors. David and I did not know each other well, but shared a belief that our open source community (OSC, hereafter) was an un safe place for anyone who did not identify as white, cisgendered, heterosexual and male. That lack of safety was further complicated by any one individualâ€™s distance from privileged modes of contribution.
