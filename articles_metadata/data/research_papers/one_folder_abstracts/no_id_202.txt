 As the diversity of digital humanities practitioners grows, the need to construct a framework allowing for equal acknowledgement to all involved has become more evident. In this article, I argue that the perceived immateriality of scholarship privileges conventional academic labor over similar pursuits, such as data curation, resulting in them being glanced over and ignored in tenure reviews and job evaluations. To counter this, I create a theoretical framework that places materiality at the forefront. More specifically, I draw on and expand Gilles Deleuze's notion of assemblages, as outlined by new materialist philosopher Manuel DeLanda, to posit the idea of data assemblages, which are the result of digital humanities labor and consist of material parts contingent on their contextual relations and always in flux. I use the Digital Public Library as a case study and highlight how the reconceptualization of digital humanities labor moves beyond the merely theoretical to allow us to better understand the interdependency of individuals in the academic ecosystem and has broader implications for the nature of materiality in the digital age.
