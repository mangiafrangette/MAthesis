 This case study outlines how writing for Wikipedia can benefit students in an undergraduate literature class by having them undertake scholarly research, read unmediated texts, and write for a real-life audience. In keeping with the collaborative spirit of Wikipedia, the rubrics provided here were primarily created by the class as a whole. Estill demonstrates how this assignment encouraged students to question received notions of literary canon and to engage critically with Wikipedia itself. Perhaps paradoxically, writing for Wikipedia gave students ownership of their writing and research. Ultimately, this assignment facilitated students to become experts on understudied topics and helped them learn about how to do literary research.
