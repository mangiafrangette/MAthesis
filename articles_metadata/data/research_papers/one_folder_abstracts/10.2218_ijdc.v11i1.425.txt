The  ability  to  measure  the  use  and  impact  of  published  data  sets  is  key  to  the  success  of the  open  data/open  science  paradigm.  A  direct  measure  of  impact  would  require  tracking data  (re)use  in  the  wild,  which  is  difficult  to  achieve.  This  is  therefore  commonly  replaced by  simpler  metrics  based  on  data  download  and  citation  counts.  In  this  paper  we  describe a  scenario  where  it  is  possible  to  track  the trajectory  of  a  dataset after  its  publication, and  show  how  this  enables  the  design  of  accurate  models  for  ascribing  credit  to  data originators.  A  Data  Trajectory  (DT)  is  a  graph  that  encodes  knowledge  of  how,  by  whom, and  in  which  context  data  has  been  re-used,  possibly  after  several  generations.  We  provide a  theoretical  model  of  DTs  that  is  grounded  in  the  W3C  PROV  data  model  for  provenance, and  we  show  how  DTs  can  be  used  to  automatically  propagate  a  fraction  of  the  credit associated  with  transitively  derived  datasets,  back  to  original  data  contributors.  We  also show  this  model  of transitive credit  in  action  by  means  of  a  Data  Reuse  Simulator.  In  the longer  term,  our  ultimate  hope  is  that  credit  models  based  on  direct  measures  of  data  reuse will  provide  further  incentives  to  data  publication.  We  conclude  by  outlining  a  research agenda  to  address  the  hard  questions  of  creating,  collecting,  and  using  DTs  systematically across  a  large  number  of  data  reuse  instances  in  the  wild.
