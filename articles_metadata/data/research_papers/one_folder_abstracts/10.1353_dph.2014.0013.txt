This essay examines the annotations of three readers of the Dartmouth Brut. Each engaged the manuscript in different ways: the first had prior knowledge of its contents, the second used the text to teach himself English history, and the third mined the chronicle as a primary source for facts. Together, these readers provide insight into why a medieval chronicle—outdated in content and manuscript form—would continue to attract the attention of early modern readers.
