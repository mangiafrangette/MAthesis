Scattered throughout the International Tracing Service (ITS) digital archive, one of the largest and most heterogeneous collections of Holocaust-related material, are hundreds of thousands of reference cards to official death certificates recording a fraction of individuals who perished within concentration camps. These cards represent the most comprehensive collection of digital material pertaining to these death certificates issued by Sonderstandesamt Arolsen, a German civil registry office. However, the reference cards can only be found dispersed throughout the Central Name Index (CNI), ITSâ€™s 46+ million-card finding aid that is indexed only by name. Consequently, aggregating the death certificate reference cards for research requires an intractable manual search. I adopt template matching and machine learning to automate the retrieval of these cards from the ITS digital archive. I demonstrate the efficacy of my method on a test set of 22,117 hand-classified cards, reporting 100% precision and 100% recall. Running this algorithm on 39,967,358 scans of cards from the CNI, I identify 312,183 death certificate reference cards in 13.75 days of elapsed real runtime on a personal computer with only a single, $600 Intel processor. Finally, I demonstrate that this approach can be generalized to many different card types within the CNI, showing great promise for application to other archives.
