Is “literary fiction” a useful genre label in the post-World War II United States? In some sense, the answer is obviously yes; there are sections marked “literary fiction” on Amazon, in bookstores, and on Goodreads, all of which contain many postwar and contemporary titles. Much of what is taught in contemporary fiction classes also falls under the heading of literary fiction, even if that label isn’t alwaysused explicitly.
