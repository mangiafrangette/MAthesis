The medieval Catalan translation of Livy's Decades, which is extant in London, British Library, MS Harley 4893, translates the fourteenth-century French version of Livy by Pierre Bersuire. The textual study of the Catalan translation and the French version suggests that the French manuscript used to produce the Catalan translation came from the court of the Duke of Berry soon after 1383, when John of Aragon (future King John I) had asked the Duke to send him a copy of the French Decades.
