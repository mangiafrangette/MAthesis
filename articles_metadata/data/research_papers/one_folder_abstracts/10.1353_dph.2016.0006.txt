The ordering of polyphonic musical works in the Machaut manuscripts relates directly to issues of layout and readability. Considering the size of the manuscripts, calculated according to surface area, the paper compares musical layout across the six Machaut manuscripts including his musical works (Paris, BnF, fr. 1584, 1585, 1586, 9221, 22545â€“6, and the Ferrell manuscript). Focusing on BnF fr. 9221, which is the largest and latest of these manuscripts, and is often criticized for its musical readings, the paper examines the idea of authority and considers the value of the manuscript to its original owner, the Duke of Berry.
