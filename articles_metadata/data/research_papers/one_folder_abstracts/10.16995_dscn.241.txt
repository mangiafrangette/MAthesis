When one needs to apply computer-assisted conceptual analyses of philosophical texts beyond their linguistic dimension, statistic macro-textual approaches have given appealing results but remain limited. In this article, we present a computer-assisted conceptual analysis methodology applied to a philosophical text. This methodology attempts to be as close as possible to the criteria of the philosophical approach. The method allows a systematic exploration through the multifaceted contexts of a specific philosophical concept. Our methodology is based on the use of a) a concordancer b) a clustering method and c) an interpretative annotation strategy. This method is applied to the concept of evolution in Bergson's corpus.
