The text represented by the Dartmouth Brut, written before 1430, was probably influenced by the political turmoil following the death of Henry V. Its omission of the stories of Constantine and Havelok—but inclusion of the story of Cadwallader—appears to represent a stage in the government’s revision of history. The stories of Constantine and Havelok would have been offensive to some since the first suggests a continuation of heroic kingship among the Welsh and the second an unflattering parallel to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who was attempting to control the government of the child-king Henry VI.
