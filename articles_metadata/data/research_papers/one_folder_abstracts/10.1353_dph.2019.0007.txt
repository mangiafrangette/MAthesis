In fourteenth-century France, Charles V's official programs of translations into French have typically been considered the instrument of a royal political agenda and concepts of translatio as a transfer of power from the clerical milieu to the lay court. However, this essay focuses on the works of one of the king's preeminent translators Nicole Oresme, more from the cultural standpoint of the translator than the king's political one. Oresme's scholastic and cultural background helps understanding how translating was an all-encompassing complex intellectual process for him and that any of the political stands that arose from his process reflected personal philosophical beliefs and worldview.
