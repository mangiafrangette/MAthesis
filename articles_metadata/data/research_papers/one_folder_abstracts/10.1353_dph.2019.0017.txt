The inclusion of the medieval Portuguese chivalric romance "The Twelve of England" into Luís Vaz de Camões's Os Lusíadas (1572) links Vasco da Gama's voyage to India and subsequent Portuguese expansionism to specific historical moments of national foundation narrated in the epic. This essay argues that Magriço (Álvaro Gonçalves Coutinho), the protagonist of "The Twelve of England," embodies a larger theme in the epic of national belatedness that is integral to the poem's engagement with the temporalities of empire and cultural inheritance. But the Lusiads's utility as a cultural artifact celebrating the rise of new forms of knowledge and power also provides the conceptual basis for its symbolic appropriation by Portugal's imperial rivals, Spain and England. The essay concludes by examining representations of Camões in twentieth-century Brazilian folhetos ("leaflets"), or literatura de cordel, to show how the Lusiads's anxieties about textual survival and generativeness provide a discursive frame for Camões's later textual incarnations.
