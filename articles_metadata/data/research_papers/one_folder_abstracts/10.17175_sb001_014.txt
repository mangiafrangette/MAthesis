›Mixed Reality‹ describes the combination of virtual environments and natural user interfaces. Here, the user's field of vision is controlled by natural head movements via a head mounted display. Data gloves allow direct interaction with virtual objects and omnidirectional floors enable unrestricted navigation through virtual worlds with natural walking movements. A quasi-experimental study showed that ›mixed reality‹ had a positive effect, particularly on affective and motivational levels. The results are interpreted in the context of the new possibilities for pedagogy offered by such innovative technologies.
