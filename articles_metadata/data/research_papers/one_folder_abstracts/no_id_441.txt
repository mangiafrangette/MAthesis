This article explores the potential of computer games to expand their emotional range and to provide their players with thought provoking and deeply moving experiences. While traditional narrative is well equipped to offer an inside view on characters and events, the fictional components in computer games tend to recede into the background during game-play. We will argue that a systematic approach on coupling rules and fiction may offer a solution to this problem. By drawing on Roland Barthesâ€™ research on the functional units of literary texts, adapting it for the interactive medium, we will identify particular aspects of fiction that are most apt to heighten emotional game-play, if strategically integrated into the rule-system.
