 This paper argues that digital humanities pedagogy can provide unique forms of attention and engagement for students at the outset of their college and university careers. It reports on courses taught at NC State University and elsewhere which use digital humanities pedagogy under the aegis of studying transformations in reading. With attention to the mediation of attention itself, these courses can cultivate habits of self-reflection to aid students in any disciplinary pathway. Furthermore, digital humanities pedagogy can offer a transferable project-based model of instruction, helping students to develop metacognitive skills as well as to acculturate to different environments across campus. Ultimately, this essay underscores the need to articulate strategies of educational transfer in digital pedagogy.
