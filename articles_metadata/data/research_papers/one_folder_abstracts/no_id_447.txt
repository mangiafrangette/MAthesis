The purpose of this article is two-fold: firstly, to illustrate the collaborative work of the TEXTE programme at NUI, Galway, in order to facilitate the move that an »old-style editor« had to undertake to electronically edit the correspondence of Irish painter James Barry, and secondly to discuss certain aspects that arose from this work in reflection to editor Tim McLoughlin’s observations which he describes by himself elsewhere in this volume. This article focuses mainly on what ›using‹ a scholarly edition means and problematizes what impact this has on the shift from hard-copy to electronic editing. It is argued that there is not so much a gap between print and electronic medium but much more a transition in a thinking process: from the output orientation of the classical style of editing towards a data- and user-driven new approach.
