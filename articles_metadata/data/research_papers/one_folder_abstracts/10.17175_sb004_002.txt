The unique characteristics of Maya writing pose special challenges for research, from which contradictory and doubtful deciphering hypotheses emerge. The project  ›Text Database and Dictionary    of Classic Mayan‹ aims at creating a machine-readable corpus of all Maya texts and compiling a dictionary on this basis. An inventory of all hieroglyphs is an indispensable instrument for further decipherment. This paper describes the development of the digital Sign Catalogue with special consideration of the modelling of decipherment hypotheses and their qualitative evaluation. Furthermore, the article emphasises the role of knowledge representation in Digital Humanities projects.
