The main tasks of contemporary digital philology are the digitization of texts, the development of complex digital editions, and the creation of text corpora that can be analyzed by machines. These activities build on methods and findings that have been explored in computer linguistics for decades. There is, however, a need to adapt those procedures to the requirements of literary analysis, such as in their granularity. This paper outlines possible approaches for the digital processing of large volumes of text and for the development of complex annotation processes. These methods change the very basis of literary analysis, especially if the texts are available on the internet. The next step, therefore, is to discuss the new possibilities for the analysis of literary text that arise from this situation. These possibilities go beyond the mere development of procedures for systematic and verifiable literary analysis of large text corpora. One new step, for example, would be the representation of multi-dimensional qualities of literary texts by data linkage in the Semantic Web, which could make literary texts available for other disciplines as well.
