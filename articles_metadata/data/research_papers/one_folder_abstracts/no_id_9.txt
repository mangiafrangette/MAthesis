One problem in humanities computing is the automatic interpretation of electronic texts. Can computers interpret texts or do they aide in the interpretation? In this paper we propose variants on the Turing Test to imagine if computer-assisted interpretation is possible. We argue that a way forward for developing models for successful machine interpreters is to work with regular expression recognition and manipulation, which is built into most programming languages in a common fashion.
