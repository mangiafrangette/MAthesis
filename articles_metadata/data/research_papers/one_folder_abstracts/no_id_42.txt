 Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer technology, one of earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the text adventure or adventure game), which first came into being in the 1970s. Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature. Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, All Hope Abandon, explores aspects of Biblical Studies through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several examples from All Hope Abandon will be given, and instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end.
