This article describes the challenges posed by optical music recognition - a topic in computer science that aims to convert scanned pages of music into an on-line format. First, the problem is described; then a generalised framework for software is presented that emphasises key stages that must be solved: staff line identification, musical object location, musical feature classification, and musical semantics. Next, significant research projects in the area are reviewed, showing how each fits the generalised framework. The article concludes by discussing perhaps the most open question in the field: how to compare the accuracy and success of rival systems, highlighting certain steps that help ease the task.
