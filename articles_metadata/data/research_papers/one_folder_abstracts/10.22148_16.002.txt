Applause is a significant cultural marker in recorded performances. In poetry performances, applause can be a means by which an audience can indicate its response to a speakerâ€™s performance or to the audience in general; a means for expressing elation and appreciation or, perhaps, dismay; and a way to engage indialog with a poem itself and affect its mode of meaning making.
