For three hundred years Shakespeare scholarship has almost unanimously agreed on rejecting a number of plays that were published under William Shakespeare's name during his lifetime, but excluded from the First Folio of 1623. Since the eighteenth century the main argument against their inclusion in the canon has been based on critical taste rather than exhaustive textual examination. However, the use of a computer KWIC program coupled with a search engine like Google shows a significant amount of verbal parallels and very rare word strings shared exclusively between the Shakespeare canonical plays and The Yorkshire Tragedy, The London Prodigal, Lord Cromwell, and The Puritan, which is consistent with tests carried out on texts from the canon.
