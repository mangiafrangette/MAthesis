This article examines the impacts of capturing correspondence metadata through an exhaustive discussion of how details such as the sender and recipient of a letter, their respective addresses, and the date of writing can be entered in an intuitive and accurate fashion. The focus is on the development of fundamental input mechanisms, which can be reused for specific metadata items. Our discussion results in the implementation of a proof-of-concept application, which shows that only a single text box is needed for each metadata item, without violating any of the self-imposed goals and requirements.
