The Digital Wenker Atlas (DiWA <http://www.diwa.info>) is primarily dedicated to the internet publication of 19th century language maps. Using satellite imaging technology, graphic files of about 1.6 GB each are linked to databases and placed at users' disposal via decompression on the fly. DiWA has grown to become a powerful information system that opens up hitherto unknown linguistic research possibilities. After an introduction to the technical aspects of the system and the range of contents, some of DiWA's capabilities are demonstrated in a case study.
