This article reports on a successful project for 3D imaging research, digital applications, and use of new technologies in the museum. The article will focus on the development and implementation of a viable workflow for the production of high-quality 3D models of museum objects, based on the 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry of selected ancient Egyptian artefacts. The development of a robust protocol for the complete process chain for imaging cultural heritage artefacts, from the acquisition of 2D and/or 3D images to the development of interactive applications for the public audience, was a specific objective of the project. The workflow devised by the university museum team combines reference photography and 3D imaging with a curatorial review of the actual object to its digital counterpart. It also integrates methodologies for managing the accompanying metadatasets to record these activities. As final stage deliverables from the process, the museum is making high-quality 3D images of artefacts from its collection available through creation and dissemination of digital 3D multiplatform interactive applications in order to allow remote access and to enhance the museum's public engagement. This short article concludes with practical considerations for a 3D imaging workflow such as time and skills needed, 3D model quality, and expectation management.
