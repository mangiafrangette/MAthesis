 In this paper, I offer an overview of an idea for a metadata archive, called the Sentences Commentary Text Archive, that attempts to collect and make accessible metadata about the five century-long medieval tradition of commenting on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. If scaled for production, this kind of archive would enhance collaboration among editors, promote previously impossible analyses of large sections of the Sentences commentary tradition, and generally become the backbone of future applications making use of this data.
