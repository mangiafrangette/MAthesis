The database Annotierte Bibliographie zur Literaturtheorie has been online since July 2007. It contains entries of recent contributions to the field of literary theory and it aims to facilitate a survey of fundamental theories, theories of interpretation and methodological approaches that are relevant to literary theory. Each entry comprises of bibliographical data as well as annotations of several types. In the next few years the database will continue to expand and improve. Our aim is to compile a comprehensive bibliography of literary theory applying the »Creative Commons License« and being globally accessible for users to search for titles within a particular theoretical field and to contribute to the database. This article introduces the idea, implementation, and the utilization of the database and outlines its further development.
