This paper proposes an ontological integration model for credit risk management. It is based on three ontologies; one is global describing credit risk management process and two other locals, the first, describes the credit granting process, and the second presents the concepts necessary for the monitoring of credit system. This paper also presents the technique used for matching between global ontology and local ontologies.
