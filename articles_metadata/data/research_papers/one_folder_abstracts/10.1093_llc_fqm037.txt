The First International Conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) was special in many ways, not least because it was the first time that the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) convened their joint conference under this new name. Held at the Université Paris-Sorbonne, Digital Humanities 2006 (to give it its shorter title) was organized by Liliane Gallet-Blanchard, Marie-Madeleine Martinet and other members of Cultures Anglophones et Technologies de l’Information (CATI). There were 214 participants from twenty-four countries. One hundred and twenty papers and sessions and thirty-one posters were presented.
