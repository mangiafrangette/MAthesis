 This contribution aims to demonstrate the importance of traceable provenance information within knowledge bases in the Digital Humanities. Besides presenting rather general aspects of how to model statements in an abstract and in an exemplary manner, the concept of fact provenance is introduced and integrated with statement expression models. Using so-called provenance chains, it is shown how provenance information that is captured within an information system can be utilized to handle contradictions and reduce the overall uncertainty of the knowledge base.
