Beginning with the assumption that text analysis and ‘algorithmic’ approaches to textual navigation provide a foundation for the dynamic scholarly edition, in 2002 I began a number of conversations of varying degrees of formality chiefly, but not exclusively, with researchers associated with the Text Analysis Portal for Research (TAPoR) initiative. My working paper is intended to recount, generically, the salient points of these discussions, as they document an important stage in our thinking about the future of the scholarly edition.
