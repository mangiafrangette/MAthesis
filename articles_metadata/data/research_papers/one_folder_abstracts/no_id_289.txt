 Collaboration is an ethically charged relationship that challenges traditional modes of authorship attribution, institutional norms, and expectations of teaching and learning. A careful reflection on the needs and expectations of project participants demands an exposure of the seams and social dynamics inherent in research-driven relationships. In this paper, we ask: How does integrating digital scholarship into undergraduate pedagogy challenge systems of evaluation and credit and affect collaboration in research environments tuned to promotion and tenure? Emerging from our participation in the Scholarly Communication Institute (2015) in the Research Triangle of North Carolina, this article presents the findings of a team tasked with evaluating best practices and better understanding how authorship and contributorship models emerge in heterogeneous teams of students, faculty, staff, #alt-ac roles, librarians, programmers, and community partners.We have used the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) to describe our contributions to this article. Please find the full reference of activities here: https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/blob/master/reference/activities.md This taxonomy was brought to our collective attention at the 2015 Scholarly Communication Institute by the Modeling contributorship with TaDiRAH team, comprised of Cassidy Sugimoto, J. Britt Holbrook, Korey Jackson, Zach Coble, April Hathcock, and Micah Vandegrift.
