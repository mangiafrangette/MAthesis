This essay considers the literary influence of the Ramon Llull's Llibre de l'orde de cavalleria at the end of the Middle Ages, both in its relatively few surviving Catalan manuscripts, and in its much more frequently found middle French translation, as the Livre de l'ordre de chevalerie. After an introductory survey of the known manuscripts, the essay examines in detail the work's diffusion and its translations, as well as its later adaptations. Finally, there is a detailed consideration of tradition, influence, and imitations. In each of these cases, the middle French translation is shown to be particularly important and influential.
