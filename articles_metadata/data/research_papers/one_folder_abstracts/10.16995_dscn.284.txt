This study identifies how the flagship Digital Humanities conference has evolved since 2004 and continues to evolve by analyzing the topical, regional, and authorial trends in its presentations. Additionally, we explore the extent to which Digital Humanists live up to the characterization of being diverse, collaborative, and global using the conference as a proxy. Given the increased popularization of “digital humanities” within the last decade, and especially recent successes in popular press and grant initiatives, this study tempers the sometimes utopic rhetoric that appears alongside mentions of the term.
