 This article investigates the topic labeling system of a widely used full-text academic publication database, JSTOR, particularly in reference to colonial North American history scholarship. Using insights developed by critical algorithm and critical archival studies, it analyzes how JSTOR’s topics repeatedly misrepresent and erase work in women’s, African diasporic/African American, and Native American and settler colonial histories. The article discusses concerns over the power of metadata, the need for transparent and domain-expert-involved indexing processes, and digital providers’ responsibilities to accurately categorize scholars’ work. It particularly focuses on the potentially disproportionate harm done to traditionally marginalized fields of study through seemingly racist or sexist topical labeling that impedes knowledge discovery.
