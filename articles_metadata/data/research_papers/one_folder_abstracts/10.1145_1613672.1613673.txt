This article presents a digital simulation of the intonarumori, musical instruments invented by the Italian Futurist composer and painter Luigi Russolo. By building the physical models of different members of the intonarumori family and a physical interface, a preservation of an important contribution to the musical heritage of the beginning of the 20th century is achieved.
