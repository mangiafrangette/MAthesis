The paper presents a method of automatic analysis of sound devices by using Attila József’s poems as a case study. The first half of the paper discusses the functions of the program hunpoem_analyzer-TEI, which was developed for the automatic annotation of sound devices and addresses the main steps of the annotation process. The second half of the paper presents different frequency lists of lexical features and sound devices extracted from the annotated corpus.
