Non-traditional authorship attribution studies are those attribution studies that make use of the computer, statistics, and stylistics. The hypothesis behind these studies is that an author has a unique and identifiable style. The computer has now become ubiquitous in eighteenth century literary studies and is the main reason why non-traditional authorship studies have advanced to where they are. David Holmes gives a good overview of the field in, The Analysis of Literary Style â€“ A Review.[1] This article surveys a representative sample of authorship studies of eighteenth century literature and gives an exemplum of an ongoing study.
