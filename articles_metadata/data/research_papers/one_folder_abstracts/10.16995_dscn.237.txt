Focusing specifically on how digital content is duplicated across the web (often with and without attribution), this essay argues that humanities practitioners currently need platforms to help them: (1) facilitate the aggregation of web-based content, (2) responsibly embed and share that content, (3) interpret the content in a flexible and open way, (4) identify and create relationships between the content, and (5) express those relationships through a variety of formats, genres, views, and arrangements. To justify these claims, the authors examine two platforms, ThoughtMesh and Scalar, using methods across digital rhetoric, interaction design, data structuring, and software studies. While the essay is largely intended for audiences interested in digital scholarly communications and platform development, it should also appeal to those invested in linked open data, media studies, and computers and writing.
