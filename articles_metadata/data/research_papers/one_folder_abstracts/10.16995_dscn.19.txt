Reading a work of digital fiction can be a challenging experience for anyone who is approaching it from a print-oriented stance. Paying particular attention to the materiality of the medium in which the work is presented can be a useful tool and this is what N. Katherine Hayles has emphasized upon by coining the phrase Media-Specific Analysis. This approach to texts, as its name states, is based on exploring the materiality of the medium in which the work is instantiated as an active component in the signifying process. The case study chosen for this paper, Chemical landscapes digital tales (2006) by Edward Falco, brings its materiality into the foreground and makes it an essential part of the reading process. In order to devise a working method for the media-specific analysis of this work (and other works of web-fiction) three different but interrelated dimensions of the text—physical organization and design, narrative strategy, and reading process—will be analyzed in this paper.
