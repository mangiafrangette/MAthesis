The first women's movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries was one of the major social movements which produced an immense body of texts. In this paper, we explore the ways in which research into the history of language use, topic development, and forms of communication in the first women's movement can be supported by Digital Humanities methods. We present an integrated documentation system that combines lexical documentation, a full-text corpus and linguistic investigations (such as on argumentation, word usage, etc.), and we show how this type of research activity can be integrated into a large infrastructure project (CLARIN-D).
