Linguistics is a challenging subject to teach online; however, some instructors are doing it with success. In order to investigate the factors involved in teaching successful online courses, the authors investigated literature related to student characteristics, instructor characteristics, and course design and implementation. The investigators then conducted a qualitative case study of actual online linguistics courses. Through observation of courses and rubrics and interviews with teachers and students, the authors analyze the factors involved with teaching a successful online linguistics course.
