 This article identifies some of the popular and historical contradictions inherent to the very notion of close reading digital literature, and puts forth an updated conception of what the author argues continues to be a vital practice of literary study.

The author applies the updated conception of close reading digital literature to Steve Tomasula's TOC , a self-described new media novel.
