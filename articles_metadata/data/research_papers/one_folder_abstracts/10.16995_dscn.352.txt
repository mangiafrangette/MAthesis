It appears that the virtual – in the sense attributed by cybernetics, namely modelling or simulation –, is entering into certain research practices in the human and social sciences, and notably those of certain historians using GIS (or Geographic Information Systems). In that respect, research involving GIS will be examined in order to evaluate, in particular, what the results are for the history discipline in terms of its methods, its concepts, and its renewal, or nonrenewal, of knowledge. Before presenting its initial findings, we will retouch on questions underlying this study and indicate some essential methodological elements.
