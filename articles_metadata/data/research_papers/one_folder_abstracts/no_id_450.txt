This article reports on a project in progress at the University of Oxford that is editing the forty-eight years of detailed diaries written by William Godwin from 1788 to 1836. Support has been provided in the form of TEI training, schema customisation, website development, and general technical support. This work so far has included tutorials on TEI (and related technologies), the creation of a Godwin-specific TEI ODD in order to customise the TEI to their needs, and numerous XSLT stylesheets for producing various lists and statistics to help them proofread and understand the markup that they’ve already applied and prepare for the next phases of encoding they are undertaking. This article is concerned with some of the the new features of TEI P5 they have used, how these have been transformed (with XSLT2), and the benefits this has accrued to their project methodology. The project, while it is an inter-departmental one, is not located in the History or English faculties as one might expect, but the Department of Politics and International Relations. Hence, the central concerns of those working on the project are the networked relationships between people, the meetings they attended, and prosopographical networks. For example, in addition to just marking up the very regular diary entries, they are also pointing from each of the over 64,000 instances of a person’s name to a TEI <person> element in a separate file where metadata is stored about that person. This form of URI-based pointing combined with prosopographical data is one of the new areas in TEI P5. The article uses this as an example to look at how the particular needs of a scholarly editing project were reflected in the TEI P5 markup chosen and how that has been chosen to be processed for a variety of different purposes, before discussing the directions the project will be going in the future.
