3D (re)constructions of heritage sites and Digital Scholarly Editions face similar needs and challenges and have many concepts in common, although they are expressed differently. 3D (re)constructions, however, lack a framework for addressing them. The goal of this article is not to create a single or the lowest common denominator to which both DSEs and 3D models subscribe, nor is it to reduce 3D to one scholarly editing tradition. It is rather to problematise the development of a model by borrowing concepts and values from editorial scholarship in order to enable public-facing 3D scholarship to be read in the same way that scholarly editions are by providing context, transmission history, and transparency of the editorial method/decision-making process.
