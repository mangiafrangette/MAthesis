With the help of specialists in the relevant fields the Herzog August Bibliothek is engaged in a pilot project concentrating on five genres characteristic of the 17th century – pamphlets, emblem books, almanacs, prayer books and books on the plague and other contagions – in order to develop document type definitions accessible via the internet. These DTDs can be employed in the future as worldwide standardisation tools for the publication and retrieval of the genres concerned. They will be developed on an empirical basis and demonstrated by using a large and representative sample of titles from each genre. We use the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and XML to encode text and metadata. The source XML-data is transformed into static HTML by an XSLT-script and thus offered to the public via the internet. The project is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)
