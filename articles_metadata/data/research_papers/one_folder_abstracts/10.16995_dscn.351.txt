In 1970, Gabrielle Roy published Windflower (La Rivière sans repos), a short novel preceded by three short stories “Nouvelles Esquimaudes.” Conserved in the Gabrielle Roy collection of Library and Archives Canada, the archives contain a myriad of manuscripts, dactylograms and sets of proofs, genuine evidence of word done by this author. In this article, the researchers put forward a meticulous genetic study of the three “Nouvelles Esquimaudes,” which takes the “Voyage en Ungava,” a travel journal written by Gabrielle Roy in 1961 in Fort Chimo, as its starting point. The authors highlight the novelist’s work methods, notably her horizontal and vertical rewriting. The digital publishing of the Windflower archives allows in itself the usage of an enlarged critical apparatus, but it also contains several specific concerns, thus raising several challenges.
