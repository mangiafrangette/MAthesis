To represent research data from the realm of the humanities in a digital knowledge graph presents a double challenge: How is uncertain data to be stored, and what does that imply for retrieval and presentation? Which notions are conveyed through uncertain data, and how do they influence our concept of knowledge? The cultural history information system ZUCCARO created by the Bibliotheca Hertziana is a good example for a complex knowledge graph. Three cases of uncertainty or vagueness are to be distinguished: Precision, plausibility and positively negative assertions. Our contribution studies the three aspects with regard to the historic reality, the state of scientific research and the usability of the content data for scholars.
