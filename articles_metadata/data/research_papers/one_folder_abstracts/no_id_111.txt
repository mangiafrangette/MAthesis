 This paper focuses on the use of the trope x is like a node in a network in works of critical theory, and shows it to be an indicator of a larger discourse, nodalism, that has its origins in 19th century neuroscience and Associationist models of mind. This discourse provides a relationship between structure and function that is used in attempts to model thought in technological devices, as in the work of Vannevar Bush and JCR Licklider. These technological instantiations of nodalism in turn provide the material basis for the expansion of the discourse into other domains, such as politics and economics. The paper concludes by considering the potential positive and negative consequence of nodalism, and the role of the digitial humanities in the reproduction of this discourse.
