We have created a tool called ImaNote (Image Map Annotation Notebook) for viewing, zooming, and annotating arbitrary-sized images using a Web browser. Multiple users can work with the tool simultaneously, being able to almost instantly see and edit each other's modifications. In this article we describe the design, implementation, and user interface of ImaNote focusing on issues arising from the Web-based nature of the software, as well as from its intended use as a tool for visualization and interaction with digital surrogates, facsimiles, and replicas of cultural heritage objects.
