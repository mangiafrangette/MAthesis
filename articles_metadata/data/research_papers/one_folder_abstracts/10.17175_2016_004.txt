The concept of the metaphor is handled critically in poetics on a theoretical level and by means of literary examples. In the process of developing an annotation schema, the ePoetics project differentiates between the significant components of the explication of the metaphor concept, and, in addition, reveals the discourse and reference structures linked to them. Thus, it becomes clear which recognition possibilities and boundaries appear in the collaborative-discursive markup process before the data evaluation – with the digital algorithmic paradigm as foil – and how hermeneutics and algorithms interact – in the tradition of Stephen Ramsay’s ›algorithmic criticism‹.
