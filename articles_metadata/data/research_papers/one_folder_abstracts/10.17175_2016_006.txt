The paper deals with linguistic transformation processes from ancient Greek sources which were translated into classical Arabic from the 9th to 11th century AD. The database Glossarium    Graeco-Arabicum concentrates on this topic and utilizes visualizations to develop an understanding of the still growing corpus of about 100,000 word records. Various examples demonstrate possible visualization methods for corpus structures, lexical differentiation, grammatical transformation and translation processes for single lexemes.
