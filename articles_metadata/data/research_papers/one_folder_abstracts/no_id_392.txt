A look from the viewpoint of the linguistic theory of text, as in this article, may result in reconsideration of some key-ideas common to many non-linguistic publications about hypertext. Since hypertext is frequently thought of as a primarily textual phenomenon (single text or system of texts), the authors of this article search for its linguistic definition based upon the knowledge about text production and reception that was gathered by many researchers in text linguistics during past four decades. A genuine concept of hypertext developed by computer science in 1960s-1980s serves in this case as a framework for the discussion. The article shows that verbal components of hypertext have to satisfy the general textuality criteria to become texts. Those criteria, however, clash with the notion of hypertext as a kind of non-constrained text and make the philosophical vision of an unlimited, universal hypertext unrealistic.
