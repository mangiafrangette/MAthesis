This article has two aims. First I argue that the old habits of the printed book often have influence on our way of thinking in our work with electronic texts. I stress here the importance of evaluating the new possibilities that the new technological tools provide for philological work. In the second part I present a project that is currently working with the Old Swedish material from the Vadstena monastery in Sweden. Central to this project is to provide electronically encoded transcriptions of the primary sources from Vadstena.
