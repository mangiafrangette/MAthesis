In this article, we introduce a methodological proposal for modelling vagueness in graphs. In addition to the modelling, we also deal with the automatic generation of implicitly stored knowledge when considering vagueness. We use the ideas of algorithms designed for description logics and apply them on graph data. We also present our software development that implements the proposed methodology. We will demonstrate the use of our applications based on three use cases in humanities and cultural studies.
