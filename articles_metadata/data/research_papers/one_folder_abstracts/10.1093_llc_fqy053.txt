A language-independent stemmer has always been looked for. Single N-gram tokenization technique works well; however, it often generates stems that start with intermediate characters, rather than initial ones. We present a novel technique that takes the concept of N-gram stemming one step ahead and compare our method with an established algorithm in the field, say, Porter’s stemmer for English, Spanish, and Portuguese languages. Results indicate that our N-gram stemmer is comparable with the Porter’s linguistic stemmer.
