This article presents the process of reconstructing three facade designs for the east wing of the Louvre using procedural modeling. The first proposal reconstructed is Louis Le Vau's 1662 scheme, the second is Gian Lorenzo Bernini's first design, and the third is the 1668 petit conseil design that still stands today. The results show how such reconstructions may aid both a general and an expert understanding of the three designs. It is proposed that by formalizing the facade description into a shape grammar with procedural modeling, a systematized approach to a stylistic analysis is possible. It is also asserted that such an analysis is still best understood within the historical context of what is known about the contemporary design intentions of the building creators and commissioners.
