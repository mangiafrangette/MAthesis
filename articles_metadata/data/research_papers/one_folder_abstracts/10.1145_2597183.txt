Intangible cultural heritage represents the cultural identities and diversity of mankind, and should be preserved and passed on to the current and future generations. However, in digital cultural heritage research, intangible cultural heritage has been relatively less studied, and the focus has been placed on creating tools and applications for professionals rather than for the general public. In this paper, we present our research effort on creating an interactive system for conveying traditional Chinese culture through natural language conversation. We propose a systematic method for the domain experts to construct, with minimal effort, the knowledge base from a set of unstructured philosophy texts, and we design an algorithm to build a conversational agent emulating the conversation ability of a famous Chinese philosopher. We also report two evaluation studies on the prototype we developed, showing encouraging results on the feasibility and benefits of our approach. By automating part of the answer-finding task using natural language processing and information retrieval technology, the system is able to find answers dynamically, without the need to manually author large amounts of question and answer pairs. Our proposed method could potentially be used to create other conversational agents for educating and promoting cultural values to the general public in a natural and appealing way.
