 Electronic literature is an important evolving field of artistic practice and literary study. It is a sector of digital humanities focused specifically on born-digital literary artifacts, rather than on using the computer and the network to redistribute, analyze, or recontextualize artifacts of print culture. Works of electronic literature appeal to configurative reading practices.

This article situates the development of the field of electronic literature within academe, some of the institutional challenges currently confronting the field, and its potential for further development.
