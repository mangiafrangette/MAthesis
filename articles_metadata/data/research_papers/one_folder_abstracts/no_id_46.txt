 With Humanities Computing and New Media identified as emerging fields of significant strength, it is time for well-funded and fully supported programs in Digital Humanities to be described, developed, and implemented in the university. This article is a description of an attempt to build such a program from the ground up, rather than from the top down. That is, the authors and others created a series of courses, both multi-disciplinary and disciplinary, a database, and a core course designed to make digital humanities a reality, even without having it certified as a program by the governing bodies of their faculty and university. In this article, the database and core course are described in some detail in order to offer what the authors believe to be worthwhile ideas to others who would advance the cause of digital humanities. The article concludes with some concrete suggestions on how to ensure support, to make faculty participation possible, to measure success, and to motivate students.
