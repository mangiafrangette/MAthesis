 This paper examines the potentialities of networked browsing, a form of faceted searching that visualizes digital archives in the form of a force-directed network graph. Using BigDIVA.org as an example of networked browsing, this paper presents the results of a small usability study that compared how participants (N = 8) engaged with BigDIVA’s networked browsing in comparison to use of a search engine such as Google. In doing so, we situate our study within performative conceptualizations of human-computer interfaces in order to explore the potential becomings when human and nonhuman machinic component are entangled together. Based on the observations from our usability study, we argue that networked browsing is suggestive of Whitelaw’s (2015) generous interfacing that emphasizes browsing as a tool for exploring relationships between nodes in archives, as well as Shneiderman’s (1996) joyous experience for interfacing with the web.
