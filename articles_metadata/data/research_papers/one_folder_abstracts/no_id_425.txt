The present paper introduces central paradigms, selection criteria and special topics for a introductory lecture on Computing in Text-oriented Humanities (CP). The term ›Computing in Text-oriented Humanities‹ (German ›Computerphilologie‹) should be understood as follows: ›Computer-‹ means some basic knowledge of non-technical user-applications while ›text oriented humanities‹ (germ. ›Philologie‹) is addressing those students and scientists dealing with language research themes or texts in any form. The paper is referring to a severalfold held course at the Language Department of the University of Hamburg.
