The following article takes the interventions originating from the Digital Humanities as a starting point to analyse research practices in the humanities in general, and literary studies in particular, and to highlight their epistemic implications. Therefore, it sketches out the basic characteristics of praxeological ›science studies‹. On this basis, the dualism ›distant‹ versus ›close reading‹ often labelled as an analytical method is problematized and reconceptualised as the metaphorical description of various hierarchies of scholarly norms.
