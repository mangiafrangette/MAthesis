The World Wide Web offers a lot of information on poets and literary texts, which may motivate people in continuing and intensifying their reading. The web-catalogue Erlanger Liste â€“ Germanistik im Internet <http://www.erlangerliste.uni-erlangen.de> (4.11.2001), where internet resources on german literature are listed and commented, could help to find such places in the web. In doing so, the list also takes part in the renewal of a cultural memory under the sign of the new media. Literary science should observe both: the way, how readers present their reading in the net, but also the consequences for the literary tradition.
