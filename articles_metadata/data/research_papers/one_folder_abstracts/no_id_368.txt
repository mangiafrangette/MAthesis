 This article describes a collaboration between two tenured faculty members (one in the library and one in a department of modern languages) at a large, land-grant institution who sought to introduce a mixed undergraduate and graduate seminar in French literature to DH methods in the second-language classroom culminating in a digital mapping project. Lacking explicit previous training in DH, faculty drew on second language (L2) pedagogy, new literacies, and DH pedagogy to develop an inclusive approach to course design and implementation. The approach focused on studentsâ€™ development of agency and authority as rising scholars while underscoring conceptions of labor and professional development in the humanities. There is limited scholarship addressing implementing DH in a L2 classroom. However, implementing a combined approach where one pedagogy influenced the other afforded the opportunity to critically consider the role of multilingualism and multiculturalism in a global, open DH context. We adopted this approach in concert with lessons drawn from theories of information literacy and new literacies. This transdisciplinary method encouraged careful consideration of design and implementation given that how information is processed, acquired, and communicated are key concerns in both L2 classrooms and new literacies.
