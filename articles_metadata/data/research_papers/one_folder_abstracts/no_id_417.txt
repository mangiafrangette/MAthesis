In the German copyright law so far the legislator has basically considered the interests of the industry rightholders for a commercial use of digital media during the implementation of the EC Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC. But the public in science and education is not allowed to use the new potentials of the information society as they need them. Six main German science organisations, more than 230 scientific societies and institutions and more than 3100 distinguished scientists and educa-tors have established the Alliance for Copyright in Education and Science to change this unbalanced situation. The aims of this movement for a better copyright law will be explained in this paper: In a digital and networked information society everyone should have access to world-wide information at any time and from everywhere for educational and scientific purposes.
