 This paper provides an overview of spatially oriented epigraphic research in medieval and early modern churches as part of the Spatial Humanities research project Inschriften im Bezugssystem des Raumes (IBR). With the help of a custom made capturing software, this field uses geometric point cloud data from terrestrial laser scans as a primary source for spatial analysis. This data, in combination with epigraphic text sources and annotations, forms the basis for research on various symbolic and functional relations between objects in church interiors.
