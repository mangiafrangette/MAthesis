Wisdom is a system for performing word sense disambiguation (WSD) using a limited number of linguistic features and a simple supervised learning algorithm. The most likely sense tag for a word is determined by calculating co-occurrence statistics for words appearing within a small window. This paper gives a brief description of the components in the Wisdom system and the algorithm used to predict the correct sense tag. Some results for Wisdom from the Senseval competition are presented, and directions for future work are also explored.
