What should a scholarly edition look like? A methodology of scholarly editing has, on the one hand, to be developed under conditions of ongoing change in text theory – as has taken place in a Material Philology – and concomitant changes of perspective on the extant documents. On the other hand, the shift to digital media is augmenting the options for representing and publishing texts and documents, and thus is a decisive factor in methodological enhancement. Stimulated by the fertile interaction of both theoretical and technical options, the digital edition of William of Auxerre’s treatise on liturgy is intended to be a contribution, drawn from practical experience, to the discussion of objectives and methodological standards in scholarly editing. The present article (1) gives some basic information on the life and work of William of Auxerre and (2) presents the features of the digital edition of his treatise on liturgy. This edition then (3) is placed in a theoretical framework; finally (4) some technical issues and problems that appeared during encoding are pointed out.
