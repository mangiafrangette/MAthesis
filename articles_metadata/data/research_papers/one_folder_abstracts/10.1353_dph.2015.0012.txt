Two manuscripts in the Parker Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, are copied in a hand which resembles that of Richard Frampton, a known clerk of the House of Lancaster in the early fourteenth century. Frampton copied literary manuscripts as well as working for the civic bureaucracy at the London Guildhall. His connections with royalty, the nobility and with Guildhall colleagues engaged in similar activities prompted an exploration of his social networks by means of software created at the University of Sheffield. The research was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and coordinated by the University of Toronto.
