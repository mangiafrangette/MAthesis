 At the meeting of the Digital Classics Association in April of 2013, I described my work-in-progress on a digital tutorial for Ancient Greek. My goal is to create a self-guided computer tutorial that people can use to learn Ancient Greek on their own in the the same way that those studying a modern language can use programs such as Rosetta Stone, Duolingo, Babbel.com, Mango Languages, etc. This article briefly details the work that has been completed since 2013, describes some of the ways that the tutorial has been successful, and explores challenges that remain to be addressed for the tutorial.
