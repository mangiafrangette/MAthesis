This essay explores the early fifteenth-century “Cour amoureuse,” or Love Court, associated with the French royal court, in the context of modern psychological work on aggression and flyting, setting up a dialogue between medieval and modern psychological theories of anger. A professor in Pediatric Clinical Neuroscience specializing in the study of anger and aggression comments on an analysis of the “Cour amoureuse” offered by a scholar of medieval studies. The exchange reveals that a distinction present in medieval theories of anger seems to have a basis in neurological reality.
