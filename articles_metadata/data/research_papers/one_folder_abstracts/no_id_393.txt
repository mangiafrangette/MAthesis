Advanced Computing in the Humanities (ACO*HUM) was a SOCRATES/ ERASMUS thematic network designed to analyse the state of humanities computing in Europe. Experts from different countries and with different fields of expertise compiled a survey on the influence of humanities computing at European universities. The methodological implications of formal methods in the humanities and the different approaches to teaching advanced computational skills provide valuable insights into the different attitudes towards education and in particular humanities education at universities in Europe. The revision of curricula and the implementation of humanities computing centres seems a necessary development in the information society of the twenty-first century; here ACO*HUM provides a knowledge base for students, teachers, and administrators.
