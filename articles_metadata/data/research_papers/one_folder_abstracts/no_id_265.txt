 This paper presents and describes a bottom-up methodology for the detection of stylistic traits in the syntax of literary texts. The extraction of syntactic patterns is performed blindly by a sequential pattern mining algorithm, while the identification of significant and interesting features is performed at a later stage by using correspondence analysis and by ranking patterns by contribution.
