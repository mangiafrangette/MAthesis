The integration of the medium Internet into the traditional system of scientific communication is still in a transitional process. New ways of knowledge transfer, different forms of communication as well as information retrieval are yet to be tested. Depending on the different communication cultures among academic disciplines, the focus of interest might vary and should be adjusted to a variety of needs and individual preferences. For the field of historical science, the example of the internet-project historicum.net and its predecessor Server Fr√ºhe Neuzeit may illustrate the search for appropriate concepts as well as the problems that arise.
