This paper focuses on the development of the e-journal IASLonline with special emphasis on the technical development of the publication of reviews. The technical editing process up to the publication of the reviews is presented in detail. As electronic publications can greatly increase the efficiency and pace of academic communication, the article argues for an equal treatment of non-profit electronic publications and print publications with regard to printing cost subsidies for publishing houses.
