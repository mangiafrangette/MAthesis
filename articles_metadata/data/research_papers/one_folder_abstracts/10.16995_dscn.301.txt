The Game of Writing (GWrit) is an online writing environment where students can comment on each otherâ€™s writing and where they get rewards for on task activity (gamification). This paper brings together research on GWrit from the following perspectives: gamification, analytic tools, user habits, evaluation and task completion structures. First we introduce the way the system was designed to support experimenting with gamification and show the gamification rule editing environment we are developing. Second, we discuss the ways we are evaluating the interface of GWrit using Cognitive Walkthrough and Heuristic evaluation approaches. Third, we look at user behavior based on Google Analytics and compare this to the behavior expected and desired. Finally, we discuss the role task completion structures play in motivating learning.
