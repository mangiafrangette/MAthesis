The study has two main parts: the first one reviews the current scholarship and theories about the materiality of text in print and digital form exemplified in the works of Johanna Drucker, Jerome McGann, Matthew Kirschenbaum, G. Thomas Tanselle and D. F. McKenzie and then presents a hybrid model of materiality that is comprehensive and practical. This model is designed to make the most use of the capacities of the digital medium and it stems from an understanding of the material repercussions of the migration from print to digital. The second part elaborates on the elements of the codex book and overviews the history of the novel genre. This is to prepare a basis for a prototype for digitizing novels, called iNovel. The last part of the study presents a detailed description of the prototype and its different tools. This prototype serves as a realization of the theoretical model described earlier.
