In this paper I will provide some background to the history of books with moving parts before using examples of such books to show that even in the first century of printing with moveable type the need for moving pictures was perceived. Next, I will describe the editorial principles I am using to guide creation of an incunabular electronic edition of one of the examples discussed in this paper, Richard Eden's The Arte of Navigation. The paper concludes with an invitation to follow a link to that electronic edition, with the caveat that it is a work in progress.
