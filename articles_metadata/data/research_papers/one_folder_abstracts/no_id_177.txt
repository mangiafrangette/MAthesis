 For Vil√©m Flusser, philosopher of technology, the advent of photography heralded the return of the image from its subjection to the linearity of written language. Here we extend his concept of the techno-image (successor of the pre-historical hand-drawn image and the historical printed word), to consider the digital image-text that today dominates reading and writing. Our question: Can we reader-writers think the digitas, or are we doomed to perform its functions in an automati[c] or robotiz[ed] fashion, as Flusser put it, so that, if anything, the digitas now thinks us? The short answer to our question is as follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of writing (digital orthography) and, secondly, as a caricature of thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, funny (digital caricature).
