Digital editions in the semantic web? This paper explores the question of the relevance and further development of semantic technologies in digital editions in the arts and humanities. The XML TEI-based editions of texts can be set on top of established publication structures. However, the widespread use of the TEI standard has led not to the interoperability of editions – despite the intentions of its creator—but rather to the increasingly strong specialization of the markup by discipline. This situation has led to the need for solutions for aggregation, re-usability, and the networking of editions as well as for encoding using a machine-readable semantic – one that is capable of generating other forms of connections using Linked Open Data (LOD), authority files, and other metadata.
