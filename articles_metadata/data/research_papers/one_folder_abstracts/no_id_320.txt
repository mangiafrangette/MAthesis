 This paper explores the art history, the digital aesthetics, the technical anatomy, and the restoration of Shu Lea Cheang’s early web artwork Brandon (1998-1999). Commissioned two decades ago by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the work is just back on view to the public after a major restoration. It seems timely to consider Cheang’s artwork: a collaboration between the artist and a network of programmers, designers, authors and other contributors that offers a creative platform for remembering and engaging with histories and issues of identity from the LGBTQ+ community. In the spirit of the piece, this article is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between a curator, a media art conservator, a computer scientist, and a scholar of the digital liberal arts, which brings together these different areas of expertise to offer an innovative and multi-faceted consideration of one artwork from a digital humanities perspective.
