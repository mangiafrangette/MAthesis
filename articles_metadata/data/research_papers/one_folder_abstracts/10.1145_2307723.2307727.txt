In this article we evaluate three modeling techniques coming from information system engineering to represent cultural heritage domain concepts. Evaluations of the modeling techniques were performed by carrying out experiments with cultural heritage specialists. The first experiment consisted in evaluating UML class diagrams and a conceptual graph. The second experiment evaluated a value cluster modeling approach. These qualitative evaluations were conducted using focus groups composed of cultural heritage specialists. We evaluated the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, and the intention to use of the three techniques (UML class diagrams, conceptual graphs, and the value cluster approach). Thanks to these evaluations, we will be able to propose a combined approach using value cluster modeling and UML class diagraming techniques to describe cultural heritage information.
