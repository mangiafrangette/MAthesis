This paper discusses the value of the electronic medium of publication for one project in particular, Inscriptions of Aphrodisias (2007), and uses this one example to extrapolate and illustrate a use-case paradigm of electronic publication and its advantages for research, pedagogy, and dissemination. The categories used in this study are: accessibility, scale, media, hypertext, updates, and iterative research and transparency. Not all of these categories apply equally to any given publication, and the discussion focuses on those that are the most appropriate to a digital publication of tagged epigraphic texts and images.
