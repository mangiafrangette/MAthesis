The article discusses possibilities of data-orientated research with digital data environments in the humanities. Starting with problems of representing meaning in data form in the context of person data, the perspectives of the Person Data Repositoryby the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften are presented. These problems are related to well known issues concerning the standardization and formalization of content when storing it in the database. This is seen as a loss of value in many humanities projects. The PDR developed an approach in which this loss is compensated by bringing together data and context of the data into the database. The main idea of the PDR is then worked out to the concept of a polysemic database.
