 This paper presents a joint project of the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig, the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University, and the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies to produce a new open series of Greek and Latin fragmentary authors. Such authors are lost and their works are preserved only thorugh quotations and text reuses by later texts. The project is undertaking two tasks: 1) the digitization of paper editions of fragmentary works linking them to the source texts from which the fragments have been excerpted; 2) the production of born-digital editions of fragmentary works. The ultimate goals are the creation of open, linked, machine-actionable texts for the study and advancement of the Classical textual fragmentary heritage and the development of a collaborative environment for crowdsourced annotations.
