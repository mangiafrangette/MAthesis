Written in the wake of the devastating Christian defeat at Nicopolis, the Epistre lamentable consistently draws on individual examples to target universal reform. Mézières establishes an intimate connection to Duke Philip of Burgundy as a fellow sufferer in Christ, attentuating the distance of hierarchical position. Once the duke is consoled by means of proven analogies—Mézières, Burgundy, and indeed all Christians are bound by wounds that replicate those of the Crucifixion—the author can go further. He becomes the duke’s counselor, or physician, and seeks to address how the Christians were routed at Nicopolis despite the justice of their crusade. Mézières dismantles the standard, self-interested bases of authorpatron address by targeting a larger and higher purpose to which to recruit Philip. He points the way to Christian recovery through his long-cherished project of a perfect knighthood, the Order of the Passion of Jesus Christ.
