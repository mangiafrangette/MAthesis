This article discusses the medieval Icelandic Nítíða saga (“The Saga of Nítíða”) as it is preserved in one of many postmedieval paper manuscripts, and takes into account not only the manuscript’s content and physical aspects, but also its social context, including its scribe, Þórður Jónsson (fl. 1667–93). The article foregrounds the existence of different versions of Nítíða saga by considering the differences between this version of the text and the better-known version from earlier manuscripts. In addition, this article offers an explanation for two scribal errors in one version of the saga through comparison with the other, and shows the importance of further manuscript-based research of this sort in Icelandic literary studies and other fields.
