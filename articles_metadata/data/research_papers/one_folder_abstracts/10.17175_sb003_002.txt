This paper presents the relationship between the disciplines involved in the digital humanities, focusing in particular on the role of computer science. Subsequently, requirements for a successful cooperation between scientists of different disciplinary backgrounds are presented, and finally, potentials arising from the digital context for the humanities are formulated. We understand digital humanities as a challenge and at the same time as an opportunity to bridge the separation of the sciences and humanities, which has been cultivated for too long.
