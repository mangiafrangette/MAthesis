 For the past fifteen year, scholarly communication networks such as H-Soz-Kult – the German Information Service for Historians – and H-ArtHist – a specialized discussion and information network for art history based in Germany with an international reach – have been steadily publishing conference announcements and reports. Since both services were born digitally, starting with the listserv infrastructure of the Michigan based H-Net and later supplemented by database-driven web sites, the archives are easily accessible by electronic means. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the archives of scholarly communication provide a suitable basis for conducting an assessment of broad fields such as German historians or German art history, with relatively low technical effort. For the initial analysis of H-Soz-KultFirst presented at the Historical Network Research Conference 2014 in Ghent., editorial practices facilitated the automated extraction of the speakers’ names as a key feature. But even in cases where no such special markup has been applied, freely available Web services such as AlchemyAPIAlchemyAPI Entity Extraction, http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/alchemylanguage/entity-extraction. provide methods that can be used to achieve comparable results.Thanks to Victoria H. Scott for suggesting analyzing H-ArtHist’s conference announcements in similar ways.
