This methodological article researches all available documentary sources regarding the ownership, making, and circulation of books within the royal House of Aragon (ca. 1300â€“1460) in order to study the creation of personal libraries linked to the royal house and investigate how individual books were transmitted from one personal library to another. The goal is to better define the intellectual profile of some of the kings, queens, and princes of the House of Aragon, such as James II, Peter III, Martin I, the young Alfonso the Magnanimous, Maria of Castile, and Charles Prince of Viana.
