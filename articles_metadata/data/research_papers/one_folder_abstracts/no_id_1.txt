The largest electronic text database in existence, the World Wide Web, makes possible, for the first time and without any outlay of costly set-up or the expensive development of project-specific tools, the observation of current usage in a number of different languages. The Web asdatabase has also the enormous advantage over other language corpora of behaving like natural language: it is dynamic, unceasingly renewing itself and thus offering snapshots of the present state of the language, with its proportion of new, established and aging usage. The paper discusses the observation, since 1998, of French, including derivation, polysemy, homophony, syntagmatic variation and the genesis of new concepts and their linguistic naming. The language corpora observed are those of micro-systems — particular words, word families and lexical constructions — and not the macro-system of the language as a whole. The tools used in the observation are keywords and search engines, in particular Google.
