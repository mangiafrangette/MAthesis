Early 20th century book collector Otto Ege removed pages from medieval texts and regrouped them into forty boxes now scattered around the United States, Canada and Europe. The University of Saskatchewan, in partnership with other institutions holding the boxes, is in the process of locating as many as possible with the goal of digitally reassembling at least one of the original texts. The project has had the unanticipated effect of focusing scholarly and public attention on the unit of the individual page as opposed to the more familiar object of scrutiny, the book.
