This paper provides an introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), focused at bringing in newcomers who have to deal with a digital document project and are investigating the capacity that the TEI environment may have to fulfil their needs. To this end, we avoid a strictly technical presentation of the TEI and concentrate on the actual issues that such projects face, with a parallel investigation of the situation within two institutions. While a quick walkthrough the TEI technical framework is provided, the paper concludes by showing the essential role played by the TEI community in providing technical and practical advice.
