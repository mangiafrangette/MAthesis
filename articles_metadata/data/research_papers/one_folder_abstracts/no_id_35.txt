The principal aim of the Internet Shakespeare Editions is to "create and publish works for the student, scholar, actor, and general reader in a form native to the medium of the Internet." Our focus to date, as texts are being edited, has been to create hypertext editions, capable of being annotated both by text and by multimedia objects. The infrastructure created by TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research), however, provides an opportunity to go further than the hypertext edition, by integrating into it the capabilities offered by textual analysis software. The aim will be to develop an interface that permits a user to go beyond the hard links provided by the editor in the basic hypertext structure to explore in a more fluid way the text of a given play, and to extend the exploration to related texts by Shakespeare and other relevant writers in the period.
