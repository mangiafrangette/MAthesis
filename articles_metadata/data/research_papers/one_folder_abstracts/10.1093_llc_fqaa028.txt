Building upon Walshâ€™s Comic Book Markup Language (CMBL) used for encoding text features of comics documents, this essay explores how CBML can be modified and expanded using additional Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) features to reflect alternative theoretical and critical approaches to comics. In doing so, this essay argues that markup languages offer not only a means for analyzing encoded documents but also a means for analyzing critical approaches to documents. Because markup language reflects the critical stance of whoever produces the encoding, any revision to the markup potentially reflects a revision to the critical theoretical framework from which the encoder operates. As such, implementation of markup language in comics studies can function not only as a metalanguage for describing comics but also as a form of meta-criticism. To this end, this essay explores methods for incorporating CBML and TEI to reflect commonly opposed approaches to analyzing comics documents.
