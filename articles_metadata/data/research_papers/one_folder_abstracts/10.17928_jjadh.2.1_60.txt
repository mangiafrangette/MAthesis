The present paper aims at designing a monitoring framework for a yet new interdisciplinary research and education program in Japan, “Cultural Resources Studies.”, "Bunkashigengaku" in Japanese. We analyze the linkage between a university, an academic association, and the practitioners’ institutions closely related with cultural resources through the mining of the principal texts produced by them. Our findings reveal the complicated relations among these stakeholder institutions, and attest to the importance of the revision cycle for the advance of interdisciplinary studies.
