Book history's disciplinary focus on the materiality and circulation of texts and textual objects has much to contribute to the domain of digital humanities. This chapter probes the legacy of D.F. McKenzie's notion of 'broken phials' and 'indeterminate texts' using the example of a flagship digital project The Printers' Web undertaken at Wai-te-ata Press, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. It offers an enhanced metacritical understanding of nineteenth century knowledge networks and points to new directions in textual scholarship in the twenty-first century.
