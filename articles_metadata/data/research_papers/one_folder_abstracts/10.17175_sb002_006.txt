The first recommendations for the classification and evaluation of digital editions were already published in the process of establishing the WWW as the primary medium of publication for digital content in the late 1990s. However, owing in part to methodological and technical developments, basic questions about the evaluation of digital editions are still being discussed. This article explores the review process as a means of evaluating scholarly digital editions, building on the background of the evaluation criteria that provide the basis for reviewing and the broader context of evaluating digital research results as a whole. In this way, many aspects can be worked out for the evaluation of digital editions: the appropriate representation of the edited object in digital data, for example, through text encoding; the innovative interaction with the digital medium; a meaningful consensus between content and form in the presentation of the edited material, etc. Despite the future changes in scholarly communication, the review as an ›evaluative genre with tradition‹ remains an ideal tool for discussing the quality of digital editions.
