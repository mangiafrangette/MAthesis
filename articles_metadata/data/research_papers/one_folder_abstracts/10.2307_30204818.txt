The article describes how the British Government sees the electronic campus as a "quick fix" for delivering its idea of the learning society and mass higher (and further) education. It suggests that this solution poses a number of major difficulties, especially for the humanities. The issues are located in a global context in which it is argued that so-called "mega-universities" will come to dominate course production and distribution. This development will have profound implications for notions of institutional autonomy and the autonomy of individual teachers, and may undermine academic pluralism. The article concludes by arguing that, in the humanities, interventions are needed to secure an appropriate meld between the existing "face-to-face" methods of teaching and learning, and the new technology.
