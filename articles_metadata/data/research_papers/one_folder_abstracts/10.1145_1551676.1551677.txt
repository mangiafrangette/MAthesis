Anastylosis is the archaeological and architectural reconstruction of a ruined monument at the historic site after careful study of the remaining original elements. We present research results concerning 3D technologies that are used in the digital anastylosis of cultural heritage monuments. Based on current state-of-the-art research, we present 3D data collection, digital artifacts reconstruction, and digital reassembly of existing fragments illustrated by means of the Octagon monument in Ephesos, Turkey. Our focus is on methods that belong to geometry processing.
