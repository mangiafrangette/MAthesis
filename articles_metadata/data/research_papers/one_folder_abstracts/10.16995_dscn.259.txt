This paper explores the role of both digital and in-person collaboration tools and considers the need for a balance between these within the context of Digital Humanities (DH) research teams. First, the uses, benefits and trade-offs of various communication channels are outlined. From there, the application of these various channels within DH research teams and their impact on collaboration will be explored by drawing upon interviews with members of DH teams. Best practices and recommendations for DH research teams and funding agencies will conclude the paper.
