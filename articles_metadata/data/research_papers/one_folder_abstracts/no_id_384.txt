This essay suggests a website edition of Bettine von Arnims complete works, including all her correspondances, concepts and other manuscript material. Crucial arguments in favor of such an edition are first von Arnim's constant interweaving of published books and private correspondances which lent her writings their specific network structure; second the problem of handling the sources, von Arnim's papers partly having disappeared after an auction in 1929 and the rest being scattered wide. To give plausibility to these argu-ments the essay sketches the works' net structure as well as the state of the manuscript sources.
