 This paper examines the internet journal Southern Spaces, launched in February 2004 and the online learning community SouthComb, started in 2006. We examine the development of these online tools, exploring pedagogical implications as well as the tools and avenues they bring to the field of Southern Studies, American Studies and scholarly communication online. We also explore the potential uses for these resources as well as their efforts to elucidate a broader understanding of the U.S. South in regional, national and global contexts.
