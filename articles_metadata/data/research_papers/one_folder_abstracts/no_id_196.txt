Intersectionality offers a critical approach to debates between theory and method in the field, transcending simplistic hack vs. yack binaries.

It surveys digital humanities projects, outlining the need for alternate histories of the digital humanities told through intersectional lenses. Finally, the article proposes ways of looking forward towards the deeper intersectional analysis needed to expand intellectual diversity in the field and move difference beyond the margins of the digital humanities.
