This essay aims to sketching out the task of a future hypernarratology by exploring the narrative function of hyperlinks and other hypertext specific ways of building a hyperstructure within the frame of digital literature. The most important assumption for any hypernarratological analysis is that the interference between the propositional content of the textual elements and the meaning, ascribed to the hypertext specific ways of connecting textual elements, is relevant for the mise en sc√®nce, and hence, for the understanding of any hypernarrative. The performative aspect of these hypertext specific ways of connecting textual elements are examined by a close reading of Susanne Berkenheger's Hypertext Hilfe!. In the focus of interest is herebey the narrative function of performative dynamical connections.
