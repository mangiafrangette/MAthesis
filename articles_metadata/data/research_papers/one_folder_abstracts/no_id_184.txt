 The recent proliferation of experimental literature has produced a critical and creative exchange between the possibilities of print and digital distribution platforms. Through a focused study of Jonathan Safran Foerâ€™s Tree of Codes, this article confronts the difficulty of citation as an occasion to develop a web based prototype or model of this decidedly paper bound text. The result of this experiment produced a digitized version of Tree of Codes that allows for a further discussion of issues of loss, deformation, and versioning alongside a wider conversation on presentation semantics on the web and browser capabilities. This article argues that experimental features on the web have a great deal to gain in a reciprocal exchange between experimental print media.
