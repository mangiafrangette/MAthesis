        "abstract": " In the present investigation, the intelligibility of 17 Scandinavian language varieties and standard Danish was assessed among young Danes from Copenhagen. In addition, distances between standard Danish and each of the 17 varieties were measured at the lexical level and at different phonetic levels. In order to determine how well these linguistic levels can predict intelligibility, we correlated the intelligibility scores with the linguistic distances and we carried out a number of regression analyses. The results show that for this particular set of closely related language varieties phonetic distance is a better predictor of intelligibility than lexical distance. Consonant substitutions, vowel insertions and vowel shortenings contribute significantly to the prediction of intelligibility. ",

        "abstract": " In the present investigation we aim to determine to which degree various linguistic factors contribute to the intelligibility of Swedish words among Danes. We correlated the results of an experiment on word intelligibility with eleven linguistic factors and carried out logistic regression analyses. In the experiment, the intelligibility of 384 frequent Swedish words was tested among Danish listeners via the Internet. The choice of eleven linguistic factors was motivated by their contribution to intelligibility in earlier studies. The highest correlation was found in the negative correlation between word intelligibility and phonetic distances. Also word length, different syllable numbers, foreign sounds, neighbourhood density, word frequency, orthography, and the absence of the prosodic phenomenon of ‘stød’ in Swedish contribute significantly to intelligibility. Although the results thus show that linguistic factors contribute to the intelligibility of single words, the amount of explained variance was not very large (R2 (Cox and Snell)=.16, R2 (Nagelkerke)=.21) when compared with earlier studies which were based on aggregate intelligibility. Partly, the lower scores result from the logistic regression model used. It was necessary to use logistic regression in our study because the intelligibility scores were coded in a binary variable. Additionally, we attribute the lower correlation to the higher number of idiosyncrasies of single words compared with the aggregate intelligibility and linguistic distance used in earlier studies. Based on observations in the actual data from the intelligibility experiment, we suggest further steps to be taken to improve the predictability of word intelligibility. ",

This area used to be a perfect dialect continuum. We test three models for explaining today's pattern of linguistic variation in the area. In each model another variable is used as the determinant of linguistic variation: geographic distance (continuum model), the state border (gap model) and social distance (social model). For the social model we use perceptual data for friends, relatives and shopping locations. Testing the three models reveals that nowadays the dialect variation in the research area is closely related to the existence of the state border and to the social structure of the area. The geographic spatial configuration hardly plays a role anymore. ",

By exploiting a multi-level representation scheme of dialectal data, the study analyses attested patterns of phonetic and morpho-lexical variation with the aim of testing the degree of correlation between a) phonetic and morpho-lexical variation, and b) linguistic variation and geographic distance. The correlation analysis was performed by combining two complementary approaches proposed in dialectometric literature, namely by computing both global and place-specific correlation measures and by inspecting their spatial distribution. Achieved results demonstrate that phonetic and morpho-lexical variations in Tuscany seem to follow a different pattern than encountered in previous studies. ",

At the same time we propose several evaluation techniques that should be used in order to deal with the instability of the clustering techniques. The results have shown that three hierarchical clustering algorithms are not suitable for the data we are working with. The rest of the tested algorithms have successfully detected two-way split of the data into the Eastern and Western dialects. At the aggregate level that we used in this research, no further division of sites can be asserted with high confidence. ",

We attempt to tackle this question by comparing five such methods using two different dialectological data sets. There are some fundamental differences between these methods, and some of these have implications that affect the dialectological interpretation of the results. ",

        "abstract": "In this study 91 local Swedish dialects were analysed based on vowel pronunciation. Acoustic measurements of vowel quality were made for 18 vowels of 1,014 speakers by means of principal component analysis of vowel spectra. Two principal components were extracted explaining more than of the total variance in the vowel spectra. Plotting vowels in the PC1-PC2 plane showed a solution with strong resemblance to vowels in a formant plane. Per location averages of all speakers were calculated and factor analysis was run with the 91 locations as data cases and the two acoustic component of the 18 words as variables. Nine factors were extracted corresponding to distinct geographic distribution patterns. The factor scores of the analysis revealed co-occurrence of a number of linguistic features.",

        "abstract": " Levenshtein distance, also known as string edit distance, has been shown to correlate strongly with both perceived distance and intelligibility in various Indo-European languages (Gooskens and Heeringa, 2004; Gooskens, 2006). We apply Levenshtein distance to dialect data from Bai (Allen, 2004), a Sino-Tibetan language, and Hongshuihe (HSH) Zhuang (Castro and Hansen, accepted), a Tai language. In applying Levenshtein distance to languages with contour tone systems, we ask the following questions: 1) How much variation in intelligibility can tone alone explain? and 2) Which representation of tone results in the Levenshtein distance that shows the strongest correlation with intelligibility test results? This research evaluates six representations of tone: onset, contour and offset; onset and contour only; contour and offset only; target approximation (Xu & Wang, 2001), autosegments of H and L, and Chao's (1930) pitch numbers. For both languages, the more fully explicit onset-contour-offset and onset-contour representations showed significantly stronger inverse correlations with intelligibility. This suggests that, for cross-dialectal listeners, the optimal representation of tone in Levenshtein distance should be at a phonetically explicit level and include information on both onset and contour.

        "abstract": " In this paper the role of concept characteristics in lexical dialectometric research is examined in three consecutive logical steps. First, a regression analysis of data taken from a large lexical database of Limburgish dialects in Belgium and The Netherlands is conducted to illustrate that concept characteristics such as concept salience, concept vagueness and negative affect contribute to the lexical heterogeneity in the dialect data. Next, it is shown that the relationship between concept characteristics and lexical heterogeneity influences the results of conventional lexical dialectometric measurements. Finally, a dialectometric procedure is proposed which downplays this undesired influence, thus making it possible to obtain a clearer picture of the ‘truly’ regional variation. More specifically, a lexical dialectometric method is proposed in which concept characteristics form the basis of a weighting schema that determines to which extent concept specific dissimilarities can contribute to the aggregate dissimilarities between locations.

        "abstract": " The present paper investigates to what extent subjects base their judgments of linguistic distances on actual dialect data presented in a listening experiment and to what extent they make use of previous knowledge of the dialects when making their judgments. The point of departure for our investigation were distances between 15 Norwegian dialects as perceived by Norwegian listeners. We correlated these perceptual distances with objective phonetic distances measured on the basis of the transcriptions of the recordings used in the perception experiment. In addition, we correlated the perceptual distances with objective distances based on other datasets. On the basis of the correlation results and multiple regression analyses we conclude that the listeners did not base their judgments solely on information that they heard during the experiments but also on their general knowledge of the dialects. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the effect is stronger for the group of listeners who recognised the dialects than for listeners who did not recognise the dialects on the tape. ",

In addition to introducing the method, it discusses phonological problems which must be addressed if any comparison of this sort is to be attempted, and applies the method to a limited data set of varieties of English. Since the method assesses their structural similarity, it will be useful for analysing the historical development of varieties of English and the relationships (either as a result of common origin or of contact) that hold between them.

        "abstract": " The research reported in this paper departs from most previous work in dialectometry in several ways. Empirically, it draws on frequency vectors derived from naturalistic corpus data and not on discrete atlas classifications. Linguistically, it is concerned with morphosyntactic (as opposed to lexical or pronunciational) variability. Methodologically, it marries the careful analysis of dialect phenomena in authentic, naturalistic texts to aggregational-dialectometrical techniques. Two research questions guide the investigation: First, on methodological grounds, is corpus-based dialectometry viable at all? Second, to what extent is morphosyntactic variation in non-standard British dialects patterned geographically? By way of validation, findings will be matched against previous work on the dialect geography of Great Britain. ",

The subject of my analysis is the genre of Japanese screen paintings known as rakuchū rakugai zu, created between the 16th and 18th centuries. Rakuchū rakugai zu provide bird's-eye views of the then-capital city of Kyoto, including buildings, natural features, and human activities. The methodology introduced here uses GIS spatial analysis functions to scan the painting surface onto a survey coordinate grid based on the relative positions of landmarks in the painting. The analytic sequence is as follows: (1) derive coordinate values for landmarks both on the painting and on a survey coordinate grid; (2) generate a link table from these two point-data sets; (3) use the projective transformation and rubber sheeting techniques to project the painting surface onto the survey coordinate grid; and (4) project the areas of the rubber sheet-derived polygons onto the painting. This process gives visual representation to differences between real space and the depicted space. Results show that rakuchū rakugai zu painted in the seventeenth century and later distorted real space more than those painted in the sixteenth century, indicating a decrease in adherence to conventional perspective-based painting.

        "abstract": " There have been growing calls to develop the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) across the humanities. For this shift to take place, two things must be demonstrated: first, that it is technically possible to create a useful GIS of textual material, the main medium through which humanities research is conducted; and, secondly that such a database can be used to enhance our understanding of disciplines within the humanities. This paper reports on a pilot project that created a GIS of two textual accounts of tours of the Lake District: Thomas Gray's 1769 excursion and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-styled ‘circumcursion’ of 1802. It describes how these accounts were converted into a GIS and explores various methodologies that can then be used to explore the spatialities embedded within their respective tours. The resulting material has been placed on the Internet at http://www.lancs.ac.uk/mappingthelakes. The pilot demonstrates that it is both possible, and conceptually fruitful, to move GIS beyond the quantitative arena in which it currently resides and into more qualitative areas of humanities research.

Cost-weight analyses calculate proxy energetic expenditures of agents who transport lithic materials from a quarry to the nearest habitation site. Illustrating energy expenditure values onto maps helps us understand changes in toolstone procurement patterns through time. Comparing energy expenditure values from one time period to another also demonstrates when agents developed the sense of territoriality. This research investigates how the central Mesa Verde Puebloans utilised resources on their landscape from A.D. 600 to 1280. ",

Therefore a virtual model of Laxton castle (England) is introduced, which was created using SEGA gaming software. ",

These systems usually hold all of a country's census and related statistics from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As such they have represent an extremely valuable resource, but at the same time they were and remain extremely expensive and time consuming to build. Was the investment worthwhile? This paper takes one of these systems, the Great Britain Historical GIS, and explores how it was built, what methodologies were developed to exploit the data that it contains, and provides an example to demonstrate how it made possible a unique analysis of railroads in Wales before the First World War.

        "abstract": " The UK's Network of Expert Centres: A collaborative approach to the digital arts and humanities. A Network of Expert Centres has been recently been established with a broad mission to facilitate exchange of expertise and outreach across the community of practice engaged in all aspects of digital arts and humanities research and scholarship, including practice-led research; and to promote and facilitate engagement with digital methodologies within the broader research community. Areas of interest and expertise of members include data creation, curation, preservation, management (including rights and legal issues), access and dissemination, and methodologies of data use and re-use. Its membership is open to all such Centres in Great Britain and Ireland. Since the demise of the Arts and Humanities Data Service and the AHRC ICT Methods Network, there has been no centralized supporting infrastructure and co-oordination of activity in this area. While the Network is by no means a substitute for these services, it will provide a much-needed focus and community resource for all aspects of the digital arts and humanities, including digital tools, projects and methods, as well as data management and sustainability. The Network will also provide greater visibility for publicly funded research projects in this area. The Network's mission is to advocate, promote and raise awareness and understanding of the use of ICT in research and scholarship in arts and humanities. It will take an active role in developing the scholarly communication agenda in relation to all aspects of digital publications, and outputs. Publications and outputs developed by members will be disseminated via the community resource, arts-humanities.net, which will support the development and exchange of expertise, knowledge, standards and good practice. The Network will also identify and represent the needs of the research community in this key strategic area, and conduct dialogue with relevant stakeholders including funders, libraries, and those engaged in teaching and research in related disciplines. This article sets out the background to the establishment of the Network, its structure and plans for future development. ",

        "abstract": " The present study deploys acoustic theory and digital analysis to investigate the dynamics of the inter-relationship of architecture and music. It assesses the impact of the built environment on music composition and performance. Drawing upon the science that underpins both architecture and music, it is also informed by the qualitative and artistic attributes of both. Reference to a specific case study, St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, describes the design and implementation of a methodology designed to allow for context and era-specific assessment. The research design is interdisciplinary, bridging theory and practice. The methodology is firmly based on the use of digital technologies, which allow for efficient, accurate and replicable procedure. Data capture, analysis and mapping of the architectural site was supplemented by reference to primary archived material. Digital preservation of primary material was an integral part of the project; the resulting record created a more complete digital repository of the cathedral, combining the information which can be read in the structure itself with documents relating to its history. This article makes use of Victor Hugo's concept of the ‘Book of Stone’ to comment on the information gleaned from paper records and digital analysis of the architecture and acoustics of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

Bakhtin's ‘Historical Poetics’ (chronotope) to illuminate GIS's ability to engage in spatio-discursive visualization and analysis. The conceptualizations and practices discussed in this paper reconsider GIS software/hardware/techniques as a means to engage subjects of concern to literary and cultural studies commensurate with the recent strong interest in the geographical and spatial dimensions of these cognate areas.

        "abstract": " This article documents the digital humanities aspects of The Holinshed Project at the University of Oxford. It outlines the nature of the project, in particular the need to compare paragraphs of the 1577 and 1587 editions of Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland. In order to accomplish these comparisons, a tool known as the TEI-Comparator was created. This is a bespoke fuzzy text comparison engine with a frontend web interface designed for the project. The TEI-Comparator automatically matches reorganised and fragmented paragraphs in the two editions. It is then used for confirming, removing, creating and annotating the links between the editions. This article describes the steps necessary to use the TEI-Comparator, its comparison algorithm, and the handling of the output it creates with respect to its use for The Holinshed Project. The TEI-Comparator was launched in 2009 as an open source project on Sourceforge and is available for other projects to use. ",

        "abstract": " The digitisation of print publications began on a small scale. In 2005 it entered a new phase, mass digitisation, with the beginning of Google's Books programme. This aimed to convert whole collections and libraries into electronic form. A US challenge to Google's digitisation plans in 2005 led to a complex legal dispute, between the company and authors, publishers and others, which remains unresolved. The advantages of the revised ‘Google Books Settlement’ (November 2009) are described, as well as the serious objections to it: these include uncertainties about ownership and use of the digitised texts and their long-term preservation, the quality of digitisation, monopoly of mass digitisation activity, and the fact that Google is not a permanent trusted institution. Alternatives to Google are analysed from the point of view of libraries and others wishing to digitise collections: these include public sponsorship and private partnerships. Future uses of the product of mass digitisation are hard to predict. Among them may be novel ways of analysing large corpora of unstructured text, and substantial interaction with contributor-users.

        "abstract": " The paper describes the key concepts and formal grammatical structures underpinning the design of a domain specific language (DSL) developed for dynamically specifying the logical choice-relationships between events and cues within live performance. A brief survey of existing approaches to describing and modelling live performance is given, both those based on generic terms together with approaches specific to particular genres and styles. The development of a generalised model of performer-activity in live performance is then introduced together with logical structures developed from the generic model which inform the language design and allow it to integrate with a wide range of performance traditions and genres. The implementation and application of these ideas in developing the Emerge language is explored through both a formal grammar and a discussion of the choices that had to be made between ease of use for the intended target users and grammatical simplicity. The features of the prototype software and language are briefly described showing how they might enable artists, both individually and collaboratively, to specify decision-making structures in advance of a performance and participate in shaping a performance as it proceeds.

        "abstract": " The digitisation of museum collections provides great opportunities for broad communication and access. However, currently the majority of online ‘virtual’ museums present information two-dimensionally. Three-dimensional data capture using laser scanning provides the potential to generate 3D virtual objects that can be used for a much greater interactive experience. This paper presents the results of a JISC-funded project aimed at the generation of a 3D online museum of an internationally important collection of Egyptological artefacts that have not previously been publicly available. The results from the project demonstrate the value of 3D museums, in addition to highlighting some of the future possibilities for interaction with objects and the ways in which such virtual museums can revolutionise access to collections for education and public interest. It also stresses ways in which such collections can benefit scholars in terms of reference collections, object analysis and interpretation. The question of objectivity and authenticity of virtual collections, in comparison with real objects is raised. ",

Revisualising the monument is only one aspect of the scholarly process.

        "abstract": " Documents of all forms have always been at the centre of research in the humanities and arts. As more literature becomes available electronically, the impact of the digital medium on reading and research also grows. This article provides a review of key research on the limitations of digital reading, spanning a twenty-year period. Most of this literature is from the computer science field of human-computer interaction. From this backdrop, this article reports the main findings of a series of detailed studies that have investigated the current difficulties and limitations of digital document reader software. These studies, all conducted in the last four years, demonstrate that there are major limitations in digital document reader software that impede a number of simple interactions between user and document. It is also demonstrated that the current problems with this software can be overcome through a re-design of the human-computer interface. Ultimately, the current shortcomings of digital document reader software are a major impediment to realising the full potential of digital humanities. However, there is ample scope to make tangible improvements and progress is urgently needed. ",

As new digital resources and tools are developed, and old tools and resources reinvented for the digital world, the practice of scholarship is quickly adapting to the expectations that content should be accessible from anywhere, that it is a raw material to be manipulated, and that an excess of information is the major challenge facing scholars. Despite these expectations, the current generation of tools are inadequate for emerging scholarly practices. JSTOR's Advanced Technology Research (ATR) group has built and collaborated on a number of software projects and platforms that attempt to provide the next generation of tools for scholars.

        "abstract": " The Educause Horizon Report states that while web-based tools are rapidly becoming standard in education and in the workplace and technologically mediated communication is the norm, fluency in information, visual, and technological literacy is not formally taught to most students. In the light of this we need new and expanded definitions and paradigms of Information and Media Literacy (IML) that promote mastering critical thinking as well as technical proficiency. This study, forming part of the Irish Integrative Learning Project, attempts to test an assumption that entrants to the humanities are media literate. This assumption, often made by educators in higher education, largely goes unchallenged. This paper reflects on the strengths and weaknesses of a series of media literacy workshops when facilitated in conjunction with the undergraduate History of Art course at University College Cork, Republic of Ireland from 2007–2009. It concludes with an example of how these media literacy workshops, indirectly, had surprisingly positive affects on a dyslexic student by scaffolding his learning and providing him with alternative entry points to learning whereby he was empowered to confidently articulate History of Art's signature disciplinary skills-set at a foundation level: critical visual analysis.

        "abstract": " The recognition that geo-technologies are playing an increasingly important role in historical research led to a meeting in Barcelona in December 2007, attended by fifty leading academics and GIS practitioners from Europe, with additional representation from leading North American experts. The conference benefited from previous meetings in Florence (2000), Ghent (2002), Amsterdam (2004), Belfast (2005), Berlin (2006), and Mainz (2007). The three-day Barcelona conference had three key aims: (1) to survey the use and maturity of historical GIS; (2) to hold an inclusive, facilitated discussion on the feasibility and requirements for a European historical GIS; and (3) to develop a white paper on how to advance historical GIS within Europe. A network of networks was a major proposal to come from the Barcelona meeting, and its outlines and rationale are advanced in this white paper. ",

        "abstract": " In this paper we describe how historical land use information has been derived for the whole of Europe, using the World Atlas of Agriculture, scale 1: 2,500,000. This paper describes the process of converting the analog land-use maps to a digital European historical land-use database, the Historical Land Use Database 1960 (HISLU60). The processing techniques that are applied in this process are commonly used for the processing of satellite imagery. The paper maps were scanned and geo-referenced. Image filtering techniques were used to eliminate the cartographic elements like text and boundaries. Land-use classes were created from the colours in the maps using image classification techniques. As a last step, GIS filtering functions were used to eliminate remaining cartographic elements and small classification errors. The HISLU60 database contains six land-use classes; arable land, grassland, forest, non-agricultural land, inland water and urban. It is a raster dataset with a cell size of 250 meters. The HISLU60 database was validated by performing a statistical comparison with three reference datasets. The overall classification accuracy is around 50 percent. Despite its limitations, the HISLU60 database gives an overview of the pan-European land use around 1960. ",

        "abstract": " The act of classification has the widest implications for scholarship. Whatever the format, it involves the totality of our being. The use of our eyes indicates that decisions about whatever it is that we observe have already been made. Yet the interaction between the mechanical act of seeing and the mind or memory has rarely been registered. An object once seen implies that the researcher's consciousness is engaged. The description of mere shape records that interaction. To establish whether sub-conscious decisions have been made as to the meaning of a shape, it might be placed in an armature. VIPS/ip software, created by both computer scientists and art historians, provides such an armature. The separate roles played by memory, brain, and eye in engaging with the shapes, encountered on the pictograph sites of the Lake of the Woods might then be detected. Subsequent labelling which bears these roles in mind just might isolate the contribution made by memory. The systematic identification and cataloguing of such images by an investigator may also enable us to understand something of the intricate and uncharted past of the Canadian Shield and about ourselves.

        "abstract": " The advent of e-learning has been a welcomed development in African universities, especially in countries where the demand for university education far outstrips capacity. This form of instruction not only has helped in reducing the problem of managing and testing large classes, but it also has helped lecturers in providing valuable assistance to students who would otherwise not have such access. The limitations of the e-learning platform coupled with a distorted student-teacher ratio has raised concerns about quality, especially for traditional humanities disciplines where the emphasis on argumentative rigor and critical thinking are at odds with the science-leaning orientation of e-learning platforms. This concern is especially important because the technology is relatively new and there are problems of access not only in terms of infrastructure but also in terms of the relevant computer literacy skills required of users of the technology. This essay examines the problems associated with the use of e-learning in teaching and examining traditional humanities courses in general but especially the problems encountered in using e-learning in teaching and assessing critical thinking courses at the University of Botswana. I argue that although certain aspects of e-learning are structured, confining, and therefore unsuitable for traditional humanities disciplines, e-learning can still be an appropriate tool for the humanities if used appropriately and creatively.

As questions of space, proximity and temporal relationships are central to the choice-making processes of both venue managers and potential spectators, so we sought to create a resource, based on a map of nineteenth-century Nottingham, that organised information about the town and its performance culture in ways that highlighted such connections and allowed us to explore the relationships between place, performance and audience within the town. Here we describe the creation of the resource and reflect on the development of our spatio-temporal mapping approach, arguing that this offers the potential to address patterns of connectivity and change across both time and space, not as a series of disconnected cross sections but rather as representative of the ‘world of process’ in which the events we study actually take place.

        "abstract": " Gazetteers play an important but largely unsung role in historical research, used with maps to help place people and events in spatial context. Recent years have seen new interest in digital gazetteers as bridges between the geospatial web and the semantic web, but many existing digital gazetteers and data models do not meet the needs of historians, as they focus on physiographic landforms rather than places of cultural meaning or administrative units. Historical researchers need to know about places whose locations are not knowable with certainty. They need to know about alternative names for places, about how names have evolved over time, and the specific historical contexts in which names were used. While GIS researchers propose temporal gazetteers, which will somehow include the precise dates at which features were created and removed, we propose historical gazetteers in which dates appear mainly in order to help reference particular instances of place names. Longer term, we need cultural gazetteers or toponymic encyclopedias that describe places as well as locate them. ",

Examining usage by and impressions of both the project team and the wider community of users, it investigates both the advantages gained and problems faced through the use of a virtual research environment (VRE).

I present an evaluative strategy grounded in the field of social informatics referred to as socio-technical interaction networks (STIN) approach. The central tenet of this analytical approach is that it models the context of humanities scholars’ routine engagement with digital technologies as a sociotechnical network-a web of relationships of technological and social elements. Using qualitative data collected from multiple sources I demonstrate the value of STIN as an analytical approach by analysing the assimilation and use of Geographical Information systems (GIS) by researchers studying historical topics. I conclude by identifying some of the core issues emerging from this study and how these issues can be useful to think about policy and strategy aspects related to digital humanities. ",

        "abstract": " This paper reflects on what research infrastructures are, suggesting that there are two dominant themes – one arising from the funding bodies postulating that research infrastructure development offers unprecedented opportunities to drive forward that which is new, which is innovative, and which drives competition and success; the other which suggests that infrastructure is subordinate, a substrate that supports the real work of research, and which becomes a thing that shifts into the background and is invisible. This paper argues that neither of these positions is wholly true or particularly helpful as we move to invest significant sums of money in digital research infrastructures. Instead, I propose that we need to view infrastructure as a material and experiential presence that is embedded in the practices and experience of research, which builds on and enhances that which already exists, that unites scholars with archivists, librarians, and museum curators, and that also finds a place for the amateur. Finally, and most importantly, I wish to argue that we must foreground the ‘research’ in ‘research infrastructures’. concentrating less on the component parts of infrastructure and instead focusing on its relationship to research practices.

        "abstract": " This paper is concerned with the development of digital humanities infrastructure – tools and resources which make using existing e-content easier to discover, utilise and embed in teaching and research. The past development of digital content in the humanities (in the United Kingdom) is considered with its resource-focused approach, as are current barriers facing digital humanities as a discipline. Existing impacts from e-infrastructure are discussed, based largely on the authors’ own discrete or collaborative projects. This paper argues that we need to consider further how digital resources are actually used, and the ways in which future digital resources might enable new types of research questions to be asked. It considers the potential for such enabling resources to advance digital humanities significantly in the near future. ",

We analyse how we can improve Holocaust-related collection descriptions for research, which we will make available online, and how EHRI provides travel grants for transnational access to existing infrastructures in Holocaust research. Both approaches help us overcome that Holocaust-related material is geographically dispersed and address the challenges for historical research stemming from the way documentation on the Holocaust has been attempted up to now. We have chosen to implement the EHRI integrated information resource using graph databases. With their emphasis on relationships, graph databases are particularly well suited for historical research in particular and humanities research in general. We analyse the architecture and implementation details of this novel approach and show how graph databases integrate with traditional ways of searching and browsing historical collections. This way, we support more advanced means of access to facts in the documents and enable deep semantically meaningful access to the documents. The innovation of EHRI lies in the combination of digital and non-digital means to integrate existing infrastructures. We believe this might be a model for many related research activities in the humanities. ",

        "abstract": " In its widest sense, infrastructure allows us as finite individuals to achieve beyond our individual capacity to know, to do, to see. But even within the narrower context of research infrastructures, broad and diverse definitions exist of how such an infrastructure should deliver these enhancements in knowledge and perspective. The Collaborative EuropeaN Digital Archival Research Infrastructure (CENDARI) project was launched in 2012 to address some of the gaps in provision for digital historical research, building on a long tradition of work in libraries, archives, digital humanities research centres and other research infrastructures. What distinguishes CENDARI, however, is its focus on what the project team has identified as the ‘grand challenges’ for each of its contributing stakeholder groups: collections experts based in libraries and archives, historians of the medieval and modern periods, and e-Scientists. This ethos, combined with its close relationship at European level to DARIAH, the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities, has instigated a unique and fruitful approach to supporting historical research with digital resources, tools and spaces.

        "abstract": " Archaeologists regularly deal with large and diverse data sets, which are frequently the only record of excavated and destroyed archaeological sites. They need digital research infrastructures to preserve and provide access to this fragile digital data and to develop tools to manipulate and analyse it. Digital data is also increasing in quantity and size, and is often born digital, but there is a high degree of fragmentation and difficulty of accessing data in an integrated way. There is a small but growing number of national discipline-specific research infrastructures, and there have been a few project based attempts to provide European exemplars. This paper describes ARIADNE, a new research infrastructure for archaeologists, funded by the European Commission. It discusses some of the major issues and challenges and introduces some of the activities that ARIADNE partners will undertake. Given the transnational nature of many archaeological research questions, there is a clear value-added for organising research infrastructures in archaeology at a European level. ",

        "abstract": " CLARIN is a recently-established research infrastructure which aims to build and sustain services based on language resources and tools. CLARIN aims to support and foster the next generation of research in the humanities, which will make use of advanced digital technologies. A distributed infrastructure is necessary in order to overcome the problems of the current fragmented environment, to create an ecosystem in which data and tools can be connected, and in which innovation will be encouraged. Case studies of early CLARIN demonstrators give a flavour of the possibilities of digital transformations in a number of humanities disciplines, and there is huge potential for important future new directions in literary and linguistic computing. For more widespread, thoroughgoing and effective transformations to take place, builders of infrastructure and researchers will need to negotiate and avoid potential pitfalls, and agree to achieve a certain measure of consensus in terms of priorities, categories and concepts. In the context of current debates about the nature of the humanities and their role in society, it will be necessary for digital humanists to be careful to preserve the unique character and importance of research in the humanities, while moving towards research infrastructures which will facilitate digital scholarship.

        "abstract": " The need for a firm understanding of the working practices of researchers in the humanities emerges as a prerequisite for the development of effective digital research infrastructures. This paper will focus on the rationale behind the design and implementation of two related studies conducted in the context of two European e-Infrastructures projects, DARIAH and EHRI. Within DARIAH the challenge involved conducting, analysing and understanding research practices of arts and humanities researchers, a largely ill-defined community encompassing a wide spectrum of disciplines. Each of them deals with a variety of objects employing an extensive number of methods. In the context of EHRI, the challenge is slightly different, due to the involvement of a better-defined research community. Holocaust researchers share well-identified objects, common ground on methods, and handle similar setbacks. In this paper we discuss the approach adopted for designing and implementing qualitative user-centric studies aimed at capturing activities, methods, and types of information objects employed by researchers grounded in identified research goals and questions. It addresses both generic and specific entities and processes, and supports the understanding of researchers’ working practices in settings as diverse and wide as DARIAH, or as specialized as EHRI. The outcomes of the analysis of working practices are used in determining user requirements for digital infrastructures to serve the respective research communities. ",

        "abstract": " This article offers a critique of the transfer of a technological-scientific paradigm of research infrastructure to the field of the humanities. This critique is informed by our experience of formulating user requirements for the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) project, and especially by a series of interviews we undertook with user-facing archivists working at EHRI partner institutions. We argue that the archival voices we recovered during these interviews articulate a range of concerns that clash with some of the major assumptions which frame current discussions about research infrastructure. In particular, we demonstrate that archival research is currently heavily mediated by archivists. And yet, inter-mediation is a theme that is insufficiently explored in recent theorising about research infrastructure. Contextualising our findings within some recent trends in archival science, we show that an infrastructure such as the EHRI must be build around the complex relationship between scholar, archivist and archive. We conclude by indicating how building infrastructures for humanities research may enable us to fruitfully re-conceptualise and re-energise this relationship by transposing it from the physical world to digital environments.

        "abstract": " An interdisciplinary team of researchers were challenged to create a model of a deep map during a three-day charette at the NEH Institute on Spatial Narratives and Deep Maps. Through a reflexive process of ingesting data, probing for fruitful research questions, and considering how a deep map might be used by different audiences, we created a wireframe model of a deep map and explored how it related to spatial narratives. We explored the tension between interfaces for exploratory and structured views of data and sources, and devised a model for the intersections between spatial narratives and deep maps. The process of creating wireframes and prototype screens—and more importantly, the discussions and debates they initiated—helped us understand the complex requirements for deep maps and showed how a deep map can support a humanistic interpretation of the role of space in historical processes.

A deep map is defined as a platform and a means of expressing historical narratives, and seeks to move beyond the current situation, where time is presented as an attribute of space, and space as an attribute of text. It sets out a conceptual design of a deep map which brings all three together, allowing articulation of a narrative in the history of one denomination of US religion, the Unitarian church in Indianapolis in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

        "abstract": " The spatial turn within the humanities and need for data richness has led to the re-conceptualisation and exploration of maps as ‘deep maps.’ Building narratives of place is becoming increasingly contingent on data landscapes as opposed to the physical landscapes within which they are situated. To make the assumption that GIS can form the basis for deep maps is to privilege the spatial dimension (and spatial data) over all others. We have sought in our experimentation to take a more open, balanced approach as to how a deep map might be organised as a way of learning/reflecting on what elements a framework should contain. Our subject matter here necessitated attention to the challenges and potentialities of deep mapping ‘things deemed religious.’ We found spatial navigation to be useful for visualizing physical and metaphysical linkages, integrating the geographical portions of our spatial narrative as well as organizing thoughts off the map.

        "abstract": " A highly structured representation of materials have been largely neglected by historians as a way to explore historical sources in part because the textual nature of the sources often seems to preclude a structured representation. This paper proposes a place for them in the historian's toolkit and explores through a few examples how, as a way to formally express an historical interpretation of a body of material, they provide a mechanism to potentially enrich the exploration and development of an historian's interpretation of that material. Highly structured data exhibits a kind of classical clarity of approach that does not fit well with current postmodern and post-Enlightenment trends in the humanities, and this article touches on these issues, and suggests a few approaches to them.

        "abstract": " It is time to make a critical appraisal of the application of the Geographic Information System (GIS) to historical research. In this article I briefly review the promises and achievements of the use of this technology in history and I also consider some of its possible developments. Based on the experience of a project on the Iberian Peninsula, a special emphasis is put on transnational GIS. In the last section, the new avenues opened by GIS to historical research and the difficulties that its application also involves are considered in the light of the evolution of historiography and of the experience of using databases in history. I argue that although the application of this tool in historical research represented an important innovation, GIS did not bring about a revolution in knowledge production in history. I also raise doubts about the notion of a spatial turn in this field. I finally suggest that the emphasis should be put, not on the technology, but on the historical problems. ",

        "abstract": " The Bentham Papers Transcription Initiative2 (Transcribe Bentham for short) is an award-winning crowdsourced manuscript transcription initiative which engages students, researchers, and the general public with the thought and life of the philosopher and reformer, Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), by making available digital images of his manuscripts for anyone, anywhere in the world, to transcribe. Since its launch in September 2010, over 2.6 million words have been transcribed by volunteers. This paper will examine Transcribe Bentham's contribution to humanities research and the burgeoning field of digital humanities. It will then discuss the potential for the project's volunteers to make significant new discoveries among the vast Bentham Papers collection, and examine several examples of interesting material transcribed by volunteers thus far. We demonstrate here that a crowd-sourced initiative such as Transcribe Bentham can open up activities that were traditionally viewed as academic endeavors to a wider audience interested in history, whilst uncovering new, important historical primary source material. In addition, we see this as a switch in focus for those involved in digital humanities, highlighting the possibilities in using online and social media technologies for user engagement and participation in cultural heritage.

        "abstract": " This paper reports from the perspective of a historian who is investigating an early medieval manuscript, aiming at opening it up for further research and exploring its location in space, time, and intellectual context. The manuscript in question and the texts it carries show a complex, interwoven network of intra- and intertextual relations and the paper argues that only a combination, provided by computational means as the methodological key, of two usually distinct research approaches, namely close reading and distant reading, can deliver answers to the research questions imposed. The paper introduces some central methods of an interdisciplinary field, commonly known as digital humanities, in the realm of data representation (data modeling and text encoding) as well as core applications in the realm of data presentation and analysis (digital editing and visualization). As these supportive methods are neither the starting-point for historical research nor an end-in-itself, they are mirrored against scholarly practices of both, of the early Middle Ages and of modern scholarship.

        "abstract": " The web is the primary means of communication in developed societies. It contains descriptions of recent events generated through distinct perspectives. Thus, the web is a valuable resource for contemporary historical research. However, its information is extremely ephemeral. Several research studies have shown that only a small amount of information remains available on the web for longer than one year. Web archiving aims to acquire, preserve and provide access to historical information published online. In April 2013, there were at least sixty four web archiving initiatives worldwide. Altogether, these archived collections of web documents form a comprehensive picture of our cultural, commercial, scientific and social history. Web archiving has also an important sociological impact because ordinary citizens are publishing personal information online without preservation concerns. In the future, web archives will probably be the only source of personal memories to many people. We provide some examples of tools that facilitate historical research over web archives highlighting their potential for Humanities. ",

        "abstract": " This paper uses Land Tax records to attempt to reconstruct the pattern of urbanization in a Pennine fringe township which formed part of the Lancashire cotton complex during the early industrial revolution. It uses logic programming to articulate rules to develop a longitudinal approach which chains together individual Land Tax records for successive years to identify perduring property objects, which are then located geographically using the pooled descriptors drawn from the returns. It investigates not only house repopulation, but also the character of new property development, of sub-division and amalgamation of holdings and the changing control of housing. It allows a remarkably detailed reconstruction of change in the particular locality, revealing events that have gone unnoticed. Pent-up demand associated with proto-industrialization combined with the self-interest of a major absentee landlord to allow a flurry of small scale construction between 1785 and 1805; property then converted to workers’ housing with the onset of industrial urbanism. More generally, it is suggested that a computational approach of this sort allows for a more serious engagement with a source all too often dismissed as unpromising. The paper concludes by drawing out implications of the work for more traditional approaches to interpreting Land Tax returns. ",

        "abstract": " Prime Minister Robert Peel was forced to resign in 1846 over the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Far from being a relatively unimportant piece of agricultural legislation, the Corn Laws, and their continuance, formed part of the ideology of the Conservative Party of the time. By proposing to Repeal the Corn Laws, Sir Robert was attacking the beliefs on which his party had won victory in the 1841 General Election. The result was a serious split within the Conservative Party over the Corn Laws. The majority of Conservatives voted against their own government, while 114 ‘Peelite’ Conservatives voted with Peel and the government. Why those particular Conservative Members decided to split away from their colleagues has been the subject of a large amount of research, mostly with ‘demand-side’ models which assume that the MP is little more than a mouthpiece for constituency interests. Peel's 1845 motion, a year before Repeal, to increase the yearly grant to the Irish Catholic seminary at Maynooth created very large controversy, and a backbench rebellion in which half of his own party voted against the government. As with Repeal, Maynooth passed only because the Opposition party decided to side with the government. This article uses principal component analysis and a classification tree analysis for the first time to show that while Conservative Members were voting with constituency interests in mind, their previous voting record over Maynooth is an overlooked and important predictor.

        "abstract": " Linking historical census data is an important task for the study of the social, economic, and demographic aspects of families and society in the past. Although various (semi-) automatic linking methods have been proposed, state-of-the-art methods have only been targeted at linking records that correspond to individuals. In this paper, we introduce an automatic method aimed at linking both individuals and households across several historical census datasets. The proposed method contains several steps, including data quality analysis and enhancement, household identity detection, as well as individual and household record linking. We have applied this method to a set of six census datasets collected from the district of Rawtenstall in North-East Lancashire in the United Kingdom between 1851 and 1901. Experimental results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the ambiguity arising from the individual record linkage, and facilitate the accurate matching of households across several decades.

More specifically, I suggest that Bornstein's work should be considered in the context of the textual and literary constructs of the digital age. I begin with an account of those elements from Bornstein's argument that I consider to be of most relevance to this particular discourse, giving particular consideration to what he refers to as the ‘bibliographic code.’ I argue that this notion has gathered fresh momentum now that its potential has been enhanced through new forms of computer-based media. What the material modernists of the modernist movement sought to achieve with the material elements of their works, contemporary scholars and critics can seek to replicate and explore with greater clarity and creativity. The bibliographic code has gained new importance, as the degree by which it can be manipulated, I argue, has been extended significantly. ",

        "abstract": " Place name mentions in text may have more than one potential referent (e.g. Peru, the country vs. Peru, the city in Indiana). The Edinburgh Language Technology Group (LTG) has developed the Edinburgh Geoparser, a system that can automatically recognise place name mentions in text and disambiguate them with respect to a gazetteer. The recognition step is required to identify location mentions in a given piece of text. The subsequent disambiguation step, generally referred to as georesolution, grounds location mentions to their corresponding gazetteer entries with latitude and longitude values, for example, to visualise them on a map. Geoparsing is not only useful for mapping purposes but also for making document collections more accessible as it can provide additional metadata about the geographical content of documents. Combined with other information mined from text such as person names and date expressions, complex relations between such pieces of information can be identified. The Edinburgh Geoparser can be used with several gazetteers including Unlock and GeoNames to process a variety of input texts. The original version of the Geoparser was a demonstrator configured for modern text. Since then, it has been adapted to georeference historic and ancient text collections as well as modern-day newspaper text.1,2,3,4 Currently, the LTG is involved in three research projects applying the Geoparser to historical text collections of very different types and for a variety of end-user applications. This paper discusses the ways in which we have customised the Geoparser for specific datasets and applications relevant to each project. ",

        "abstract": " This article argues that the study of literary representations of landscapes can be aided and enriched by the application of digital geographic technologies. As an example, the article focuses on the methods and preliminary findings of LITESCAPE.PT—Atlas of Literary Landscapes of Mainland Portugal, an on-going project that aims to study literary representations of mainland Portugal and to explore their connections with social and environmental realities both in the past and in the present. LITESCAPE.PT integrates traditional reading practices and ‘distant reading’ approaches, along with collaborative work, relational databases, and geographic information systems (GIS) in order to classify and analyse excerpts from 350 works of Portuguese literature according to a set of ecological, socioeconomic, temporal and cultural themes. As we argue herein this combination of qualitative and quantitative methods—itself a response to the difficulty of obtaining external funding—can lead to (a) increased productivity, (b) the pursuit of new research goals, and (c) the creation of new knowledge about natural and cultural history. As proof of concept, the article presents two initial outcomes of the LITESCAPE.PT project: a case study documenting the evolving literary geography of Lisbon and a case study exploring the representation of wolves in Portuguese literature.

        "abstract": " New data sources, for example in the form of geotagged image libraries and digitised archives of historical text documents, provide us with new opportunities for exploring how place is described. Using a framework derived from work in human geography and information science, we illustrate how there is more to place than names and coordinates. Through a set of case studies we explore different aspects of the seemingly trivial query ‘mountains in the Alps’ addressing a range of issues including ambiguity, the use of vernacular names, ways in which concepts such as mountain are used in different locations and by different groups, approaches to automatically generating macro-maps in space and time and, finally, techniques allowing regions to be characterised and compared based on the terms used to describe them. The use of all these methods in combination allows us to come closer to a meaningful representation of place in the sense of human geography within the context of Geographic Information Science. However, our approaches focus on the naming of places and their material or perceivable properties, and there is still much work to do to properly represent place, and particularly sense of place. Nonetheless, we suggest that such approaches have considerable potential for those working in the digital humanities, and especially those concerned with contributing to a spatial turn therein. ",

        "abstract": " This paper discusses the development of digital intellectual and technological geographies showing spatial distributions of information and proposes to combine these with network representations of actors and documents relevant for the history knowledge exchange in Early Modern Europe. The amount of technical and fortification drawings that were copied throughout Europe and the New World and the different nature of networks in which they were exchanged raises the question whether they belonged to the Republic of Letters, as some authors claim. We argue that instead of trying to explain knowledge exchange in Early Modern Europe by focusing on The Republic of Letters as one entity consisting of scholars , it might be more useful to reconstruct the spatial distribution of actors and of (non-)textual documents in virtual networks of knowledge. Inspired by the term “deep maps” coined by David Bodenhamer, we will introduce the concept of “deep networks” and explore the requirements for their future development. Hereto, we focus on the representation of historical evidence and of uncertainties in analyses of intellectual and technological letters and drawings and hybrid combinations of these. ",

We use the original text and other public available data to create a social network (i.e. a graph) that comprises of all actors in the Iliad together with their interactions. We present some visualizations of these data and discuss concepts like connectivity, connected components and groupings. Furthermore, we calculate some well-established metrics, coming from social network analysis in this social network and discuss the numerical results. These results indicate that the Iliadic network is a small-world network, rather dissasortative and relatively easy to disconnect. ",

        "abstract": " As the study of cinema has increasingly turned to the examination of economic ebbs and industrial flows, rather than focussing its attention solely on the critical evaluation of the films themselves, new analytic techniques and tools have been adopted (and adapted) by film scholars. Key amongst these is the use of innovative visualization techniques that can assist in the understanding of the spatial and temporal features of film industry practices. However, like the cinema itself, visualization carries its own spatial and temporal dimension. This article explores some of the benefits and limitations that derive from the use of spatial visualization technologies in the field of cinema studies. In particular, this research presents a new holistic multivariate approach to spatio-temporal visualization for point based historical data. This method has been developed through extending the spatial presence in timeline graphics and through meaningful spatial classification and representation. ",

        "abstract": " In the field of cinema history, an increased interest in social experience and context has challenged the centrality of the film and the primacy of textual analysis. The ‘Early Cinema in Scotland, 1896–1927’ research project takes a contextual approach, using geo-database tools to facilitate collaboration. This article shows how spatially-enabled methods can also be mobilized to bring issues of representation back into a cinema history project. We argue that, when the films have not survived, their geographical descriptors as recorded by trade-press reviews and catalogues offer new avenues of analysis. The article argues that foregrounding location as a significant element in the film corpus creates a new point of interconnection between film text and context. The juxtapositions and divergences between the spatial patterns of film production and cinema exhibition are connected to pre-cinematic traditions of representation. The spatial distribution also sheds light on the differences between films made for local and international consumption, reflecting on Scotland's position in relation to discourses of modernity. ",

        "abstract": " Using ArcGIS, this article maps the narrative locations of French cinema's box office successes and César du meilleur film winners against a self-consciously international version of prestige, the French submission for best foreign language film at the Oscars from 1976 (when the Césars began) to 2012. Mapping domestic consumption and prestige against the for-American-consumption vision of prestige and possible box office appeal will identify the settings that are associated with domestic and international locations of Frenchness. Do films that succeed at the box office connect themselves to France's main population centers—Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille—or to less-populated and economically vibrant regions, as with Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis (2008) in Bergues? To what extent do prestige films seek out marginalized areas in which to set their stories, as in the Paris banlieues of La Haine (1996) or Sète in La Graine et le mullet (2008)? Do the films that France proposes to the Oscar voters address an imagined American preference for one part of France—Paris—over another, or do they turn to other, less globally-integrated locations? Where are the overlaps among these three categories? And where are the empty spaces that neither box office nor prestige address? This article will be a spatial history, drawing on Franco Moretti's ‘distant reading’ approach to groups of films to demonstrate the critical potential for mapping narrative locations as a way to conceive of the multiple nations—in this case France—that cinema imagines for its domestic and international audiences.

        "abstract": " This article presents methodological starting points, heuristics and the results of a GIS-based analysis of the history of Slovenian literary culture from the 1780s to 1941. The ethnically Slovenian territory was multilingual and multicultural; it belonged to different state entities with distant capitals, which was reflected in the spatial dynamic of literary culture. The research results have confirmed the hypotheses of the research project ‘The Space of Slovenian Literary Culture,’ which were based on postulates of the spatial turn: the socio-geographical space influenced the development of literature and its media, whereas literature itself, through its discourse, practices and institutions, had a reciprocal influence on the apprehension and structuring of that space, as well as on its connection with the broader region. Slovenian literary discourse was able to manifest itself in public predominantly through the history of spatial factors: (a) the formation, territorial expansion and concentration of the social network of literary actors and media; (b) the persistent references of literary texts to places that were recognized by addressees as Slovenian, thereby grounding a national ideology. Taking all of this into account, and based on meta-theoretical reflection, the project aims to contribute to the development of digital humanities and spatial literary studies. ",

        "abstract": " Situated in the wake of the first and second waves of the Digital Humanities, the Digital Literary Atlas of Ireland, 1922–1949 website provides interactive mapping and timeline features for academics and members of the public who are interested in the intersection of Irish literary culture, history, and environment. The site hosts Google Earth software produced interfaces with the EXHIBIT Timeline functions made available by the Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information in unLike Environments (SIMILE) project, developed and hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Library. This paper's case study maps the biographical lifepath of the writer Samuel Beckett using digital humanities techniques such as ergodicity, and deformance. The geo-digital-timeline mapping of his biography allows us to visualize the shift in Beckett's literary perspective from a latent Cartesian verisimilitude to more phenomenological and fragmented, existential impressions of time and place. The atlas's visualizations of his Wanderjahre years in various European metropoles chart the intellectual and aesthetic influences shaping the Beckettian literary landscapes of his later and better-known works, such as En Attendant Godot (1953). Beckett's thought, works, and shifts in perception provide insight into how digital cultural mapping practices and third wave digital humanities methodologies and tools can be conceptualized and operationalized.

        "abstract": " This paper explores the limits of spatial representation for understanding historic mobilities in a rural Australian setting. For this research, an historical GIS was populated from paper map archives denoting where and when bitumen roads were sealed in the Bega Valley, NSW. Using existing geospatial methods, a temporally sensitive network analysis was conducted, revealing a picture of regional mobility reshaped by modernist infrastructure improvements. Yet a straightforward binary pitting sealed roads as ‘good’ vs unsealed roads as ‘bad’ was challenged in subsequent qualitative interviews with long-time residents. Instead, a range of opinions emerged about the role that differing road surfaces played in everyday and historic mobilities. A fuller picture of the motivations and cultural associations of bitumen vs dirt road driving resulted from deploying humanities research methods of interviewing and discourse analysis. Such an approach revealed preferences and motivations that sometimes challenged inferences gained from mapping results alone. There are limits then in relying solely on historical cartographic data to produce maps and spatial representations and existing humanities techniques may hold, in some instances, greater explanatory power.

        "abstract": " At the heart of the emergence and development of the Digital Humanities has been the potential to move beyond the out-dated epistemological and metaphysical dichotomies of the later 20th century including quantitative-qualitative, pure-applied, and campus-community. Despite significant steps forward, this potential has been only partially realized as illustrated by DH pioneer Edward L. Ayers’ recent question, ‘Does Digital Scholarship have a future?’ As a way to think through current challenges and opportunities, this paper reflects on the building and initial use of the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI). As one of the largest projects in the history of the social sciences and humanities, CCRI enables research on the making of modern Canada by offering complex databases that cover the first half of the twentieth century. Built by scholars from multiple disciplines from coast-to-coast and in collaboration with government agencies and the private sector, CCRI team members came to grips with key DH questions especially those faced by interdisciplinary, multi-institutional, cross-sectoral and internationally-connected initiatives. Thinking through this experience does not generate simple recipes or lessons-learned but does offer promising practices as well as new questions for future scholarly consideration. ",

        "abstract": " Scholars have long been interested in networks. Networks of scholarly exchange, trade, kinship, and patronage are some of the many such longstanding subjects of study. Recent and ongoing digital humanities projects are now considering networks with fresh approaches and increasingly complex datasets. At the heart of these digital projects are ‘network ontologies’ — functional data models for distilling the complicated, messy connections between historical people, objects, and places. Although scholars creating network ontologies necessarily focus on different types of content, if these networks are to form a coherent body of scholarship in the future, we must work towards the creation interoperable ontological structures, rather than yet another set of competing standards. Here we examine the methodological considerations behind designing such interoperable ontologies, focusing primarily on the example of Early Modern historical networks. We argue that it would be infeasible to adopt a single ontological standard for all possible digital humanities projects; flexibility is essential to accommodate all subjects and objects of humanistic enquiry, from the micro-level to the longue-durée. However, we believe it possible to establish shared practices to structure these network ontologies on an ongoing basis in order to ensure their long-term interoperability. ",

        "abstract": " In Fall 2013, the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, engaged five postdoctoral fellows placed in five different institutions to explore issues related to data curation for medieval studies. In May 2015, these fellows convened a two-day workshop on the sharing and publishing of Linked Open Data (LOD). Funded by a CLIR/Mellon microgrant, the workshop brought together librarians, technologists, and scholars to brainstorm on the challenges posed to medievalists in sharing data on digital platforms.2 The workshop offered a forum in which to discuss the complexity of medieval data and the challenges of sharing and publishing it. It enabled participants to appreciate LOD's potential to express complicated data sets in our area of study and aid the navigation of those data sets, as well as understand how LOD can facilitate scholars to share and publish research outcomes more effectively. In this article, we take the lessons learned from the workshop and apply them to a set of complex data: 13th-century French motets, short pieces of music usually consisting of three lines and incorporating manifold connections and references. Following an outline of LOD, a detailed explanation of the motet and the manner of its composition will set the scene for elucidating the levels of complexity to be found in motet metadata, and hence why the LOD model can aid us in negotiating the data. We will then demonstrate an effective application of LOD by proposing a proof-of-concept system for organizing a select set of motets. ",

        "abstract": " This article will explore advances in the field of educational data modeling that have implications for modeling humanistic data. Traditional humanistic inquiry, bolstered by micro-analyses conducted by the scholar, has made way for machine-assisted methods that parse and quantify large amounts of qualitative data to reveal possible trends and focus more analogue approaches. At best, this play between human- and machine-directed approaches can lead to more profound explorations of texts. In this exploration of qualitative-quantitative methodologies that leverage human agency and machine-directed techniques, I suggest a mixed methods approach for dealing with the humanities. Specifically, this discussion will analyze the current methodological tensions related to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics to reveal best practices for modeling humanistic data. Principle questions of interest in this essay include: What defines literary “big” data? How can we define DH modeling and where does it depart from traditional data modeling? What role does machine-based modeling have in the context of the scholarly close read? What can we learn from educational data modeling practices that are in the midst of resolving tensions between human-machine patterning? ",

        "abstract": " Future historians will describe the rise of the World Wide Web as the turning point of their academic profession. As a matter of fact, thanks to an unprecedented amount of digitization projects and to the preservation of born-digital sources, for the first time they have at their disposal a gigantic collection of traces of our past. However, to understand trends and obtain useful insights from these very large amounts of data, historians will need more and more fine-grained techniques. This will be especially true if their objective will turn to hypothesis-testing studies, in order to build arguments by employing their deep in-domain expertise. For this reason, we focus our paper on a set of computational techniques, namely semi-supervised computational methods, which could potentially provide us with a methodological turning point for this change. As a matter of fact these approaches, due to their potential of affirming themselves as both knowledge and data driven at the same time, could become a solid alternative to some of the today most employed unsupervised techniques. However, historians who intend to employ them as evidences for supporting a claim, have to use computational methods not anymore as black boxes but as a series of well known methodological approaches. For this reason, we believe that if developing computational skills will be important for them, a solid background knowledge on the most important data analysis and results evaluation procedures will become far more capital.

        "abstract": " Contemporary and future historians need to grapple with and confront the challenges posed by web archives. These large collections of material, accessed either through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine or through other computational methods, represent both a challenge and an opportunity to historians. Through these collections, we have the potential to access the voices of millions of non-elite individuals (recognizing of course the cleavages in both Web access as well as method of access). To put this in perspective, the Old Bailey Online currently describes its monumental holdings of 197,745 trials between 1674 and 1913 as the “largest body of texts detailing the lives of non-elite people ever published.” GeoCities.com, a platform for everyday web publishing in the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s, amounted to over thirty-eight million individual webpages. Historians will have access, in some form, to millions of pages: written by everyday people of various classes, genders, ethnicities, and ages. While the Web was not a perfect democracy by any means – it was and is unevenly accessed across each of those categories – this still represents a massive collection of non-elite speech. Yet a figure like thirty-eight million webpages is both a blessing and a curse. We cannot read every website, and must instead rely upon discovery tools to find the information that we need. Yet these tools largely do not exist for web archives, or are in a very early state of development: what will they look like? What information do historians want to access? We cannot simply map over web tools optimized for discovering current information through online searches or metadata analysis. We need to find information that mattered at the time, to diverse and very large communities. Furthermore, web pages cannot be viewed in isolation, outside of the networks that they inhabited. In theory, amongst corpuses of millions of pages, researchers can find whatever they want to confirm. The trick is situating it into a larger social and cultural context: is it representative? Unique? In this paper, “Lost in the Infinite Archive,” I explore what the future of digital methods for historians will be when they need to explore web archives. Historical research of periods beginning in the mid-1990s will need to use web archives, and right now we are not ready. This article draws on first-hand research with the Internet Archive and Archive-It web archiving teams. It draws upon three exhaustive datasets: the large Web ARChive (WARC) files that make up Wide Web Scrapes of the Web; the metadata-intensive WAT files that provide networked contextual information; and the lifted-straight-from-the-web guerilla archives generated by groups like Archive Team. Through these case studies, we can see – hands-on – what richness and potentials lie in these new cultural records, and what approaches we may need to adopt. It helps underscore the need to have humanists involved at this early, crucial stage. ",

As a complex data source, the World Wide Web presents its own methodological challenges for digital humanists, but lessons learned from projects studying large nineteenth century corpora offer helpful starting points. Complicating matters further, legal and ethical questions surrounding web scraping, or the practice of large scale data retrieval over the Internet, will require humanists to frame their research to distinguish it from commercial and malicious activities. This essay reviews relevant research in the digital humanities and new media studies in order to show how web scraping might contribute to humanities research questions. In addition to recommendations for addressing the complex concerns surrounding web scraping this essay also provides a basic overview of the process and some recommendations for resources. ",

        "abstract": " Computational analysis and digital humanities are far from neutral processes and sites unimpeded by the political, social and economic context in which they emerged and are utilized. As an interdisciplinary field, the digital humanities have transformed the relationship of humans to computers broadly conceived. At the same time, the methods, theories, perspectives and the concomitant digital tools developed are being criticized for reproducing the social divisions that exist in society. The effort to recover Black women's subjectivities from the digital minefield is not without its challenges, reflected in our study which searched approximately 800,000 books, newspapers, and articles in the HathiTrust and JSTOR Digital Libraries. The goal was to identify perceptions and lived experiences of Black women that emerged and the resulting knowledge that developed. The project team discovered multiple challenges related to the rescue and recovery of Black women's standpoints or group knowledge. This essay explores how even as computational analysis has embedded biases, it can be utilized to recover the experiences of Black women from within the digitized record. Thus, computational analysis and all that it encompasses not only makes visible Black women's experiences, but also expands the scope of the digital humanities. ",

        "abstract": " This paper discusses issues concerning the creation of conversion tables for East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and European calendars and describes the development of an open source calendar database as part of the history of converting East Asian calendars. East Asian calendars encode both astronomical and political cycles. As a result, date conversion must in practice rely on complex look-up tables and cannot be done merely algorithmically. We provide a detailed overview of the history of such conversion tables and find that the modelling of these tables into the digital follows a trend of increasingly detailed computation of chronological time. The Buddhist Studies Time Authority Database was designed to allow computational conversion of the Chinese, the Japanese and the Korean Calendar, between each other, as well as with the Gregorian, proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendar. It relies on the Julian Day Number (JDN) as common referent for all conversions. ",

A systematic description is essential for enabling weavers to document and secure intellectual property rights, and for preserving their rich cultural heritage. We present a linked data structure for modelling non-rectilinear as well as rectilinear weaving patterns, different from both a grid and a topological representation. We have implemented two editors using the same data structure for two classes of users (non-weaver users and weavers of warp-faced textiles). We describe the data structure and compare the operator sets of the two editors to access it. We give a first evaluation of the editors by showing how they can be used to model the complex structures of real-world textiles. ",

        "abstract": " This article is an exploratory study using a smallholding diary and GIS to project the spatio-temporal pattern of a smallholding's travel in late nineteenth century Sweden. Through time-series of smallholding's daily diary notes, we develop an understanding for how smallholders adjusted to and participated in Swedish government policy, which resulted in the process termed ‘agrarian revolution’. Between 1872–1892, Tomtas Smallholding altered its spatio-temporal patterns from seasonal travels to production according to market demands and along new lines of transportation like railways. While the smallholding also used railways to visit distant places, it was primarily their produce that travelled further unto international markets. This also influenced the smallholding demography, from an extended household towards a nuclear family. As market demands shifted from subsistence to dairy products, the smallholding contracted primarily female farm servants due to their specialisation in milking. ",

        "abstract": " Historians and historical quantitative social scientists, motivated by a renewed interest in quantitative history and by sophisticated tools for digital infrastructure, are developing data repositories for global-scale and collaborative analysis. However, their archives have been slow to grow. This article is directed toward historians who are contemplating such projects. Repository development is very valuable. On the other hand, studies show that repository projects that rely upon voluntary contribution from numerous researchers seldom reach critical mass. Our surveys and our study of the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis Data Hoover Project confirm this assessment. We conclude that historical data repositories remain poorly aligned with present day scholarly practices and are unlikely to realize their promise until the social life of data becomes a part of the profession. Because we believe that this is possible we introduce four strategies, each one backed by a successful project, that will help to make data sharing a part of professional practice. These suggestions are: 1) hiring ‘data hoovers’ to solicit and curate data, 2) appealing to close-knit communities and networking their domain-specific archives, 3) rightsizing crowdsourcing tasks, and 4) incorporating peer review.

        "abstract": " This project explores the power of lines to tell stories. For architects, lines are elemental devices: they catalyze and structure our ability to describe space. But can they describe time and experience? The following case study explores this question in depth while tracking the historical expansion of suburban life in San Antonio, Texas. The research focuses on five roads, re-imagining them as a series of concentric timelines that stretch from the city's historical center to its suburban periphery. To date the multi-disciplinary team—led by architect Ian Caine with collaboration from a historian and an urban geographer—has utilized three distinct media to represent the chronological growth of San Antonio: 1) a large two-dimensional timeline that the team exhibited in a museum gallery, 2) a video-based spatial-temporal narrative that simulated the experience of driving through the city, and 3) a web-based interactive timeline.1 This article establishes the merits of the first two approaches—which are both complete—before speculating about the potential of the web-based version to recast the timeline as a narrative device capable of illuminating the complex relationship between time, space and experience in the contemporary city.

        "abstract": " Ethnohistorians and other scholars have long noted how European colonial texts often concealed the presence and participation of indigenous peoples in New World conquests. This scholarship has examined how European sources (both texts and maps) have denied indigenous history, omitted indigenous presence, elided indigenous agency, and ignored indigenous spaces all while exaggerating their own power and importance. These works provide examples of colonial authors performing these erasures, often as a means to dispossess. What they lack, however, is a systematic means of identifying, locating, and measuring these silences in space and time. This article proposes a spatial history methodology which can make visible, as well as measurable and quantifiable the ways in which indigenous people and spaces have been erased by colonial narratives. It presents two methods for doing this. First, narrative analysis and geovisualization are used to deconstruct the imperial histories found in colonial European sources. Second it combines text with maps to tell a new (spatial) narrative of conquest. This new narrative reconstructs indigenous activity through a variety of digital maps, including ‘mood maps’, indigenous activity maps, and maps of indigenous aid. The resulting spatial narrative shows the Spanish conquest of Peru was never inevitable and was dependent on the constant aid of immense numbers of indigenous people. ",

        "abstract": " Practicing cultural geography in a web-based digital medium has led to the possibility of resurrecting early-twentieth-century ideas about the primacy of space in organizing information. In this article I discuss the philosophical underpinnings that drove the creation of my digital monograph Enchanting the Desert. Different than a spatial narrative that associates data points with their attendant cartographic representations, I use space—and specifically landscape—to order my information. Spatial proximity bundles and orders items on its own, a priori giving meaning to things existing next to one another in a landscape. Using space as a way to forge topical relevancy appears to be an uncommon approach, but in fact is paramount for a more productive and holistic ecological practice. The digital medium of the interactive web application makes this spatial epistemology possible. ",

It explores how San Jose typified the challenges of Silicon Valley's rapid urbanization and desire to chart a new form of industrialisation predicated on the ‘greenness’ of high-tech manufacturing and development. These issues are examined through a variety of mapping and GIS projects that seek to understand areas of cities threatened by natural hazards, to unveil the growth of cities over time, and how polluted areas introduced environmental hazards to social inequality. The article concludes that studies of urban areas cannot be separated from questions about the environment and its role in social justice, urban planning, and politics. ",

Engaging critically with the evolving theory and practice of deep mapping we reveal how collaborative water research designed to provide a framework for indigenous water legislation is expressed visually on a Google Earth platform. This aquatic counter-map, or as we call it, a deep chart, not only empowers the Tlingit and Tagish, but reclaims and revitalises critical cultural values, whilst simultaneously preserving linguistic and cultural memory in a digital form. More broadly, the deep chart is currently being brought into global water ethic debates as a visual ethno-cartographic example of an alternative relationship humans might have with water, paving the way for a new water consciousness. This is in direct contrast to current, dominant and sometimes destructive global water governance and water management models and practices. We showcase a participatory and aqua-centric deep charting paradigm that is evolving through Geographics Information Science (GIS) platforms in collaboration with the CTFN (Tlingit and Tagish) community and government. This research challenges the contemporary cartography of the dominant Anglo-American valuing of water. It also presents an alternative water vision that we argue can shift ‘terra-centric’ thinking towards ‘aqua-centric’ thinking. It further provides a blueprint for informing global water ethics debates. ",

Scholars can shape place-making, but only by guiding the public to their own sense of place rather than telling them how to do so. Scholars must also be aware of the limitations inherent to all representations of place, and work to foster active engagement through multiple avenues of exploration. This paper explains a collaborative project at the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum that uses methods definitive of a digital geohumanities to bring past landscapes alive, making the spatial connections that narrate the shaping of the city. We developed a deep mapping project where museum visitors a) interface with web-delivered, time-enabled animated maps on standing gallery tables, b) compare historic photos with adjacent contemporary street views on those maps, and c) engage with other geovisualizations that portray historical and geographical change. Visitors also have the opportunity to use mobile devices to take walking tours throughout the city, and to provide their own content and directions for the project. This hybrid of scholarly-led, multi-media narratives blended with public participation and open navigation can be a template for other deep-mapping projects to create connections to place. ",

        "abstract": " American urban historians have begun to understand that digital mapping provides a potentially powerful tool to describe political power. There are now important projects that map change in the American city along a number of dimensions, including zoning, suburbanization, commercial development, transportation infrastructure, and especially segregation. Most projects use their visual sources to illustrate the material consequences of the policies of powerful agencies and dominant planning ‘regimes.’ As useful as these projects are, they often inadvertently imbue their visualizations with an aura of inevitability, and thereby present political power as a kind of static substance–possess this and you can remake the city to serve your interests. A new project called ‘Imagined San Francisco’ is motivated by a desire to expand upon this approach, treating visual material not only to illustrate outcomes, but also to interrogate historical processes, and using maps, plans, drawings, and photographs not only to show what did happen, but also what might have happened. By enabling users to layer a series of historical urban plans–with a special emphasis on unrealized plans–‘Imagined San Francisco’ presents the city not only as a series of material changes, but also as a contingent process and a battleground for political power.

The question is how this approach aligns with tensions, today, surrounding the multiplicity of endeavour associated with modeling practices of annotation by practitioners of the digital humanities. Our work, hence, surveys annotative practice across its reflection in contemporary praxis, from the MIT annotation studio whitepaper (http://goo.gl/8NBdnf) through the work of the Open Annotation Collaboration (http://www.openannotation.org), and manifest in multiple tools facilitating annotation across the web up to and including widespread application in social knowledge creation suites like Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web annotation) ",

        "abstract": " Pope's The Dunciad. A Heroic Poem (1728), Dunciad Variorum (1729) and Dunciad in Four Books (1743) foreground the modelling and critique of different modes of annotation: elements of the commentary are attributed to a variety of fictitious, fictionalised or actually existing annotators, and the shaping of the material is significantly engaged with questions of print technology and mise-en-page. This paper analyses the techniques by which Pope deploys annotation as part of the work's oppositional rhetoric, and argues that, in the hands of his authorised editor Warburton, this approach gave rise to annotation that worked against the long-term interests of the poem and its author. The essay concludes by drawing out some possible implications for the practice of digital annotation. ",

        "abstract": " Between 1490 and 1525 various German print shops produced a great number of rather short texts that were the subject of university lectures as fascicles for students. Wide margins and line spacing left room for hand-written notes taken during the lecture course. Many of such annotated copies allow us to assume that the annotations are not textual commentaries in the usual sense. Rather, they are examples of a media practice indicating the tension between orality, handwriting, and printed books, especially since both the oral lecture course and the individual notes represent processes of transmitting and storing knowledge in which the text that is being explained does not even play a central role. We may compare them to modern, frequently collaborative practices that pursue aims going beyond straightforward models of text explication, which may help us develop more precise descriptions as well as a deeper understanding of the hermeneutics of textual annotation.

        "abstract": " While most literary scholars wish to help readers understand literary texts by providing them with explanatory annotations, we want to go a step further and enable them, on the basis of structured information, to arrive at interpretations of their own. We therefore seek to establish a concept of explanatory annotation that is reader-oriented and combines hermeneutics with the opportunities provided by digital methods. In a first step, we are going to present a few examples of existing annotations that apparently do not take into account readerly needs. To us, they represent seven types of common problems in explanatory annotation. We then introduce a possible model of best practice which is based on categories and structured along the lines of the following questions: What kind(s) of annotations do improve text comprehension? Which contexts must be considered when annotating? Is it possible to develop a concept of the reader on the basis of annotations—and can, in turn, annotations address a particular kind of readership, i.e.: in how far can annotations be(come) individualised?

        "abstract": " Interpretation is widely regarded as the core activity of literary studies. Still, the appropriate balance between the plurality and the limitation of possible interpretations is a non-trivial issue. Whereas it is sensible to accept that literary texts can generally have various meanings, it should not be possible to attribute any kind of meaning to a text. Therefore, while interpreters must be allowed to disagree in their analyses, it must at the same time be possible to review whether a disagreement is actually based on adequate reasons like, for example, textual ambiguity or polyvalence. In this paper, we propose a best practice model as one effective means to review disagreement in accordance with literary studies principles. The model has been developed during the collaborative, computer-assisted annotation of literary texts in a project in which short stories have been analyzed narratologically. The examination of inconsistently annotated text passages revealed four types of reasons for disagreement: misinterpretations, deficient definitions of the categories of analysis, dependencies of the relevant categories on preliminary analyses, and textual ambiguity/polyvalence. We argue that only disagreements based on textual ambiguity are considered legitimate or valuable cases of disagreement, whereas the other three types of disagreement can be resolved in a systematic way.

        "abstract": " Traditional historico-critical music editions provide scholars and musicians with an edited score based on the interpretation of various sources such as the composer's autograph(s), letters and other materials from copyists or publishers. Their digital counterparts have the potential to offer new and more expanded ways to explore the work. This is based on the possibility to provide large amounts of source materials and to annotate more extensively (since printing costs are irrelevant). Furthermore, audio and video recordings of performances can be integrated. But, similarly important, the user interface makes it much easier to navigate in the complex network of cross-references between various source materials and the editor's annotations. The XML-based Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format is the standard music representation format for digital music editions. In this article we discuss current MEI-based annotation practices and outline the current challenges for music annotations, including a discussion of anchoring options, the embedding of addressable elements in the local musical context, the annotation of audio, and the categorisation of annotations. This leads to a discussion of open questions such as the ability to secure authorship in open and reusable editions. ",

Annotations can be seen as expressions of research activity which can be turned into input data for subsequent research. The digital paradigm has profoundly altered the ways in which we humans can handle the information content of our sources and it also affects the practice of annotation. We explore new ways of annotation that were not feasible before the digital times, and we list a few requirements for annotation to act as a reliable source of research information. Rather than conducting an academic discussion on the ontology of annotations, we highlight practical use cases for new kinds of annotations. We illustrate those in a concrete system for linguistic annotations to the Hebrew Bible, SHEBANQ. ",

This article examines the potential benefits of collaborative mapping for encouraging student interaction with local residents, while also considering the value of spatial analysis to the interdisciplinary aims of a course centered on theatre and French Studies. One author is a cultural anthropologist and professor of French, and the other is a professor of theatre. The course explores theatre as a window into French society and culture in three distinct geographic settings (Avignon and the rural Vaucluse, Marseille, and Paris). Space is important to its study of theatrical literature, of theatrical form and site-specific performance, and of the varied meanings of theatre to people living in diverse social environments, including rural settings and neighborhoods in urban centers and peripheries. Written prior to implementing the project for the 2017 version of the course, this article examines a mapping project intended to fully exploit the opportunities of study abroad for student engagement with other perspectives abroad, and for inter-disciplinary dialogue and exchange.

My colleague Paul Achter and I and teach a course on The Wire, a critically acclaimed series from David Simon aired on HBO, is a five-part series on the problems facing the City of Baltimore. The Wire is uniquely suited to ‘deep mapping’ because of the role of city spaces in every season. The City of Baltimore is a character as much as any of the human characters in the series. Initiating a class project on creating and developing a spatial map of The Wire locations as a way of understanding Simon's critique of contemporary political and social policy.

The complexities of these sites and the competing narratives that surround them are difficult for students to grasp in a condensed period of time. Using approaches from the spatial humanities, this article offers a case study for enhancing student learning through the creation of digital maps and itineraries in a campus-based course for subsequent use during a three-week program in Berlin. In particular, the concept of deep mapping is discussed as a means of augmenting understanding of the city and its history from a narrative across time to a narrative across the physical space of the city. As itineraries, these course-based projects were replicated on site. In moving from the digital environment to the urban landscape, this article concludes by noting meanings uncovered and narratives formed as we moved through the physical space of the city. ",

        "abstract": " John Milton's 1644 declaration that ‘Books are not absolutely dead things’ makes him a rock star among undergraduate English majors who are covetous of the material, reassuringly physical book. This essay explores that metonymic dichotomy through a project that combined the ‘old’ technology of the hand-press book and the ‘new’ technology of GIS story-telling. Using a visiting special collection of rare books for students at a small college, the project approached hand-press era books in three phases: 1) a bibliographic description and transcription; 2) book forensics, and 3) a ‘deep map’ of a book. With mapping—understood as an expression of spatial thinking—as a guide, students recognized that the singular text, even the dialogic text, is far less remarkable than locating and articulating the links between history, place, literature, and culture. Students engaged with terminology (descriptive bibliography), recognized the temporal lines of the book as an object (provenance), followed the development of a book as a polyglotous intellectual entity, and reviewed the geographic/historical experiences of the author and of the book (biography, publishing). The spatial turn allowed students to construct (and in some cases, deconstruct) the cultural world in which texts, authors and printers collide. ",

        "abstract": " This essay articulates the concept of ‘critical chorography’ through a discussion of the productive intersection of pedagogy in the spatial humanities and map theory as applied to the visualization of early modern maps using contemporary GIS technology. In method, the essay lays out a comparative model for the analysis of maps across early modern and contemporary digital practices by theorizing student-driven practices of mapping first through a deep attention to historical location and documentary evidence, and second, through an inquiry into the digital implications of mapping jurisdictional conflicts through case studies focused on westward expansion in the West Indies. To those ends, the essay examines the drive in contemporary spatial humanities to use the map as a tool of analysis, rather than merely as a platform for visualization and presentation. ",

        "abstract": " This essay addresses drawbacks to short-term study abroad courses offered at small liberal-arts colleges, as well as difficulties students encounter in such courses. These difficulties arise due to the extremely full itineraries that the course structure may seek to provide, which can become overly burdensome to students in terms of what they are able to process fully, and what they retain during the course and after the course is over. One avenue of possible amelioration of this difficulty, while not challenging the opportunity to expose students to a wide range of sites and course-topical material, is a reliance on mapping. In terms of pre-travel, the map serves as orientation, a setting of expectations for what will be seen. During the course, while onsite, students are able to use the supplemental materials offered on the interactive map better to understand their surroundings. After the course, revisiting the map, along with their course notes, photos, and journals, provides an essential aide-mémoire. Choosing potential sites for extensive mapping based on those sites students are least familiar with is a way, then, to maximize the map's impact on learning outcomes. ",

        "abstract": " High impact learning experiences hold forth great promise for enhancing the personal and intellectual development of students. First year experience abroad offers opportunities for students to explore a study abroad topic in depth at an early point in their academic career. Recently, significant numbers of faculty have begun to lead study abroad groups on the Camino de Santiago in Spain. Due to the increasing popularity of walking the Camino overall, overcrowding and other related issues are becoming a problem. I propose that faculty leading student groups on the Camino incorporate digital mapping tools as part of the curriculum to increase awareness among students about the potential impact they may have on local communities. Furthermore, the use of digital mapping tools to either complement or replace the more traditionally assigned journal will help the student meet the desired learning outcomes set forth by the first year experience abroad program—develop, experience and reflect. By understanding spatial relationships, students will ask questions and make connections that they otherwise would not have. ",

The goal of STREAM is to facilitate and innovate historical research into local and regional processes through the development of a spatiotemporal infrastructure for early modern Brabant and Flanders, two of the most urbanized and developed areas of pre-industrial Europe. To this end, STREAM systematically collects a range of key data from a diversity of historical sources to provide a geographically comprehensive and long-run quantitative and spatial account of early modern society at the local level (parishes, villages, towns) regarding territory, transport, demography, agriculture, industry and trade, related to the development of a tailored historical geographical information system (GIS) based on the well-known Ferraris map (1770–1778). This article discusses the possibilities and pitfalls of the data collection and the construction of a spatial infrastructure for the pre-statistical era. ",

        "abstract": " Primary historical source materials represent a very real challenge to GIS. In contrast to modern datasets where tabulated and structured data usually correspond neatly to fixed boundary units, primary historical source materials occur in predominantly unstructured text format. In these instances, people, events, and places must be unraveled from handwritten scripts and, if possible, subsequently linked and coupled to some form of mapping. In this paper, a database solution to handling primary source material is discussed that enables the original text and its translation to be ingested into the system and for people, familial relations, events, and images to be linked and queried in real time. In particular, the system connects these databases via toponyms to a tightly coupled mapping interface. The system enables thesauri of people's names and places to be created on-the-fly and allows levels of confidence to be assigned by the investigator to these matches. Full database and toponymic search and linking capability is enabled. In addition, a mobile application supports investigation in the field to access details in the databases at the same time as ingesting additional data and information in real-time to the system. Through the use of this dynamic database coupling and union to a map interface it is proposed that the system provides a powerful platform for use with primary unstructured source material and contributes to a deeper mapping and understanding of historical place.

In the first part, thus, we will sketch the initial impulse that made the project come to life; then, we will outline the basic structure, features, and general characteristics of the database and its web application, briefly commenting on how that database design correlates and conflicts with the ontologies of historical sources underlying the reconstruction process. In the second part, we will try to tackle the question of whether projects of such tailoring should have a place within the spatial humanities, which seem to have shifted or solidified their epistemological center in poststructuralist, postmodern, postcolonial, and neo-geographic discourses, advocating for a reflected employment of digital spatial tools focussing on their different roles within the humanities instead of enforcing a growing divide between a theoretical navel-gazing and an atheoretical practice.

        "abstract": " This article joins calls for literary scholarship to move beyond the limitations of binary oppositions between ‘close’ and ‘distant’ reading and towards the development of approaches that exploit the macroanalytic potential of digital methods alongside the nuanced analysis that characterises literary scholarship. Drawing on a customised corpus of writing about the English Lake District, we model the application of a multiscalar approach known as geographical text analysis (GTA), which combines aspects of close reading and distant reading, and, in doing so, introduces a new method for literary research. Here, we focus on historical descriptions of the Lake District's soundscape to demonstrate both how perceptions of sound changed over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and how multi-scalar methods can uniquely uncover such historical-literary shifts. Sound, we argue, offers a particularly useful focus since it allows us to draw fruitful parallels between our methods and those applied by the writers we study. In this way, this article advocates for digital humanities scholarship that advances our disciplines in conversation with appropriate historical modes. ",

        "abstract": " For three years now, a research group at the University of Santiago de Compostela has been working on the creation of literary maps of Compostela.1 In this application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to literature, with the focus on a city of remarkable symbolic relevance, problems emerged, mainly concerning the mappeability of uncertainty and the codification of recurrence and emotions. The point of departure was a very precise group of texts belonging to the subgenre of the ‘estudiantina’ that depict the life of Santiago University students at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. In this paper, we intend to present the results, showing the achievements, the limits and the new challenges that emerged. Literary cartographies have proved useful for the study of symbolic production and for tourism. Less attention has been paid to its applicability to education, and yet, the tools used so far for creating literary cartographies can be applied to the study of literary texts produced by students, so that the resulting maps and graphics cast important information for the analysis of how students understand and deal with places, how they relate to the cities they live in and, thereby, reveal the constitution of their mental maps. In this paper, we will compare literary maps of Santiago obtained on the one hand from the database created with the ‘Estudiantina’ and, on the other, from the database of 40 texts written by current students. Taking the maps as a point of departure, we will reflect on the historical changes in the imaginary of the city and the way it is perceived, inhabited and lived by current students. ",

        "abstract": " The abundance of information contained in nineteenth-century texts means the traditional ‘close reading’ of Victorian culture has limitations. With the burgeoning availability of newspapers in digital format, there is a pressing need to look at how we might effectively and efficiently use these digital resources to help answer research questions and add to key historical and geographical debates. Focusing on the analysis of a large digital corpus, this paper has two key foci: (I) to apply an innovative digital methodology, that combines corpus linguistics and geospatial technologies, to a very large corpus of newspaper texts and; (II) apply said methodology to a case study assessing the presentation of health and disease in a nineteenth-century newspaper. The paper illustrates that by linking existing techniques with new and innovative approaches it is possible to temporally and spatially analyse and map themes of interest in large digital corpora on a scale not possible through more traditional close reading methods.

        "abstract": " ‘Qualitative spatial reasoning and representation’ is a range of techniques developed in Artificial Intelligence to meet the need for a computational treatment of qualitative spatial relations. Examples of such relations include ‘next to’, ‘overlapping’, ‘to the left of’, ‘separate from’, ‘including’, and so on. These relations occur within the data found in the spatial humanities, but the computational techniques described here do not appear to have been used in connection with this context. While Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are widely used as a means of visualizing and exploring material in the spatial humanities, GIS technology is acknowledged to be ill-suited to information that is vague, uncertain, ambiguous, imprecise or having other qualities that in a scientific setting could be regarded as imperfections. In the humanities such ‘imperfections’ are of course important, and qualitative spatial relations are one source of data that challenges scientifically based GIS. This article reviews the origin of qualitative spatial reasoning and representation in A. N. Whitehead's mereotopology and argues for exploring how these methods could complement GIS as a computational technique in the humanities. Qualitative representation is applicable to modelling spatial arrangements in many domains, not just geographical space. This is demonstrated through an example of spatial relations in lines of printed text. ",

        "abstract": " Techniques for extracting place names (toponyms) from texts and using them to conduct analyses of the geographies within the texts are becoming reasonably well established. These are generally referred to as Geographical Text Analysis (GTA) and allow us to ask questions about the geographies within a corpus. The limitation of this approach is that the geographies that can be uncovered are solely associated with toponyms for which a coordinate-based location can be assigned. While this method is valuable, it is effectively a quantitative representation of the geographies associated with named places. Other representations of geography are ignored. To complement GTA, we need to develop techniques that are capable of representing the more qualitative representations of geography that are found within texts. Drawing on the Corpus of Lake District Writing, this paper presents some initial ideas about how this can be achieved, primarily by using techniques from corpus linguistics. ",

        "abstract": " This article responds to the widespread and oft-noted challenges digital humanists face in working with data that is uncertain and characterised by complex narratives. Using an example drawn from the vast archives of post-war interviews with Holocaust survivors, it draws on approaches developed in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) to explore how two key spatial aspects of survivor's narratives – their uncertain wartime trajectories and the slippage in scales as these are retold – can be represented. Spatial information in narratives tends to not provide the exact coordinates necessary to store the information in geospatial databases. Instead, narratives rely much more on often less precise qualitative spatial relations such as ‘near’, ‘next to’, ‘at the corner of’ without precise geometric interpretations. Given that relational databases are ill-equipped to store this kind of relational spatial knowledge from natural language sources, the article argues for a need for digital humanists to return to first principles and reconsider database design. Descriptive triple-based graph representations, which have been devised to accommodate this kind of highly irregular, semi-structured relational knowledge, have the potential to work with, rather than against, the grain of the narrative sources that underlie the work of much of the digital humanities.

        "abstract": " For some time now, the field of Spatial Humanities has acknowledged the need for a system capable of the spatial exploration of historical and archaeological phenomena beyond Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This idea comes from the need to analyse holistically spatial information, including that which is not geographic (i.e. vague, symbolic and imaginary space). In addition, this need becomes more apparent when dealing with traditions that do not conform to the Modern/European/Cartesian conception of space in which GIS is rooted. This article, explores the use of Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) and Semantic Triples as possible alternative means to model complex and diverse expressions of spatial information, including social and symbolic conceptions in 16th century Mexican maps. Using as case study the map from the region of Atengo-Misquiahuala (Hidalgo) which combine the Mesoamerican and European traditions, we explore how these approaches might open new venues of research, potentially shedding light to long discussed and problematic Mesoamerican spatial categories. Focusing on a contained and partial example, we examine from a theoretical perspective and as a starting point, the possible future implementation of these approaches for historical and archaeological research.

        "abstract": " The GB1900 project used crowd-sourcing to transcribe all text from the second edition County Series six inch to one mile maps of Great Britain, published between 1888 and 1914, a total of c. 2.55m. geo-located text strings. These locate almost every farm and about half of all street names. The paper describes the final datasets, and how they were created. It then presents a detailed comparison with five other freely-available gazetteers of Britain: Geonames, the US government's NGA gazetteer, the Ordnance Survey's 50k and Open Names datasets, and the English Place Name Survey's DEEP project. Comparisons are presented at national level and, more qualitatively, for an area of eastern England. The results demonstrate both GB1900's greater volume of geo-located entries and its ability to locate places and features identified in other historical sources beyond administrative hierarchies: this is the most detailed historical gazetteer, certainly for Britain and possibly for anywhere. The final online system is described, including its integration of place name histories from DEEP. ",

        "abstract": " Historical place databases can be an invaluable tool for capturing the rich meaning of past places. However, this richness presents obstacles to success: the daunting need to simultaneously represent complex information such as temporal change, uncertainty, relationships, and thorough sourcing has been an obstacle to historical GIS in the past. The Qualified Assertion Model developed in this paper can represent a variety of historical complexities using a single, simple, flexible data model based on a) documenting assertions of the past world rather than claiming to know the exact truth, and b) qualifying the scope, provenance, quality, and syntactics of those assertions. This model was successfully implemented in a production-strength historical gazetteer of religious congregations, demonstrating its effectiveness and some challenges. ",

        "abstract": " The tithe files contain a large amount of agricultural production data, but have not been much used for econometric analysis. The data is the result of averaging and estimating, thus some doubt has been cast on its accuracy. This article shows that for eight counties in the southwest of England, some data from the tithe files is reasonably reliable and was recorded in a consistent manner. The article demonstrates how tithe files and other data can be geocoded with spatial information so that an analysis using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) may be performed. Three tests are carried out, showing that pastoral rents followed a ‘distance decay’ model; that reported arable yields were consistent with exogenous variables; and that arable rents were set with economic variables in mind.

        "abstract": " This paper describes several aspects of a formal digital semantic model that expresses some issues presented by medieval charters. Surprisingly, perhaps, this model does not deal directly with a charter's text and is not mark-up based. Instead, it draws on the authors’ experience with the construction of three highly structured factoid-oriented prosopographical databases that drew heavily on charter sources, and that also did not explicitly contain a digital representation of the charter texts. The paper explains the way in which the structured data model thus derived differs from text-oriented approaches such as TEI/CEI work that has been done so far on charters. It presents a view on why this factoid-based model seems to capture more readily some of the complexity in the apparent meanings of the charters, and suggests that this is because it is also more likely to relate to a richer conception of the broader medieval world in which these charters were created than text-oriented work does. Finally, drawing on recent work on the ChartEx project, it explores how a combined approach, that takes the best of both text-markup and structured data modelling techniques, could evolve in the future.

        "abstract": " For over half-a-century (1803–54), the Australian colony of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), played a key part in Britain's globe-spanning unfree diaspora. Today, a rich built and archaeological landscape, augmented by an exhaustive and relatively intact documentary archive, stand as eloquent markers to this convict legacy. As historical archaeologists, we have spent countless hours querying the physical and documentary residues in a bid to understand how the penological, social and economic imperatives of Britain and the colony shaped the management of convict labour. In particular, our task has centred upon the recovery of individual narratives – of both gaoler and gaoled – from such residues, moving away from a traditional focus on the broader outlines of the convict system. This paper illustrates how spatial history methodological processes have been used to relocate individual historic lives back into the convict industrial landscape of the Tasman Peninsula (Tasmania). Focusing on the male-only penal station of Port Arthur (1830–77), we will illustrate how we have reunited the physicality of past spaces and places, with the lives and labours of those who created and navigated them. Simple methodologies have been used to achieve this, designed with onward applicability in mind. A complex series of documents, convict conduct records, have been mined for spatial markers, allowing events and people to be relocated back into space. Through these processes of linkage and visualisation, we have been encouraged to ask further questions about the management of the unfree labour force and how this came to create the landscape we see today.

        "abstract": " Art that incorporates brain-computer interface (or BCI) technology sheds fresh light on several aspects of aesthetic theory. Because it is radically interactive and can permit viewers or listeners to modify a work directly by means of their cerebral activity, such art illuminates the role of audience members in shaping that work's meaning; in this way, it literalizes reader-response theory and allows the public to engage even with opaque or alienating pieces. BCI-based art also reframes the significance of the artist's intentions, prompting a reconsideration of the truism that ‘the author is dead’, both by positing a collective form of authorship and by granting a creator access to her own unconscious impulses. Finally, via the notion that it may be possible to transfer unfiltered ideas between brains, BCI-inspired artworks provide a new perspective on art as mediation. Although artists have traditionally been praised for seeming to grant direct access to their emotions, one could argue that artistry happens in the act of concretizing and externalizing one's ideas – that is, in the mediated translation of thought rather than in thought itself. The essay concludes by discussing the implications of this theoretical framework for (among other fields) the digital humanities. ",

        "abstract": " The visual image has long been central to how war is seen, contested and legitimised, remembered and forgotten. Archives are pivotal to these ends as is their ownership and access, from state and other official repositories through to the countless photographs scattered and hidden from a collective understanding of what war looks like in individual collections and dusty attics. With the advent and rapid development of social media, however, the amateur and the professional, the illicit and the sanctioned, the personal and the official, and the past and the present, all seem to inhabit the same connected and chaotic space. However, to even begin to render intelligible the complexity, scale and volume of what war looks like in social media archives is a considerable task, given the limitations of any traditional human-based method of collection and analysis. We thus propose the production of a series of ‘snapshots’, using computer-aided extraction and identification techniques to try to offer an experimental way in to conceiving a new imaginary of war. We were particularly interested in testing to see if twentieth century wars, obviously initially captured via pre-digital means, had become more ‘settled’ over time in terms of their remediated presence today through their visual representations and connections on social media, compared with wars fought in digital media ecologies (i.e. those fought and initially represented amidst the volume and pervasiveness of social media images). To this end, we developed a framework for automatically extracting and analysing war images that appear in social media, using both the features of the images themselves, and the text and metadata associated with each image. The framework utilises a workflow comprising four core stages: (1) information retrieval, (2) data pre-processing, (3) feature extraction, and (4) machine learning. Our corpus was drawn from the social media platforms Facebook and Flickr. ",

        "abstract": " This paper addresses the viability of two multivariate methods (Principal Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis) in verifying the disputed authorship of a famous Arabic religious book called (Nahjul-Balagha/ Peak of Eloquence). This book occupies an exceptional position in the history of the huge debates held between the two basic Islamic sectors: Sunni'e and Shia. Therefore, it represents a serious challenge to the viability of the multivariate techniques in resolving certain types of historical and sectarian conflicts and controversies. Furthermore, verifying the authorship of this book could be a good opportunity to find out whether there are certain quantitative techniques of attribution that hold for different languages such as English and Arabic. Function words have been targeted in this paper as possible indicators of the author's identity. Accordingly, a set of Arabic function words would be tested using WordSmith Tools (version 5). It turned out that the multivariate techniques are most likely robust for addressing the type of issues raised about Nahjul- Balagha. Besides, it appeared that the statistical patterns of function word usages are quite sensitive to genre in Arabic. ",

        "abstract": " Germany, 1935: the engineer Konrad Zuse (1910–1995), in the living room of his Berlin house, devotes himself to the design and construction of a binary, programmable machine, the Z1, capable of processing data in a fast and efficient way. While building his machines, he also started to devise a conceptual and notational system for writing ‘programs’ to execute applications much more complex than the basic arithmetic calculations. He delved deep into the study of formal logic in order to work out his “computation plan”, the Plankalkül. Although the Plan Calculus didn't exercise much impact on German post-World War hardships, it displays all the traits currently recognized as standard features of modern programming languages. The aim of the present study is to highlight the general purpose and technical specifics of this language, its historical and scientific background, and the philosophical inspiration leading Konrad Zuse to employ the predicate logic in the formalization of the “computation projects” for his machines.

At its core it seeks to investigate the research question how the Bulgarian independence affected agricultural production in two regions (centered around the cities of Plovdiv and Ruse) of today's Bulgaria, for which there are conflicting yet empirically unsubstantiated claims concerning the economic impact of the political independence. Using our be-spoke geo-sampling strategy we believe, we have sampled regionally representative commensurable agricultural data from the 1840s Ottoman archival documentation, in accord with agricultural censuses conducted by the nascent nation state of Bulgaria in the 1890s.

There is surprisingly little scholarly literature, however, on the process of database construction in humanities projects. This article describes a process of interdisciplinary database design that emerged in the course of building the core sections of an historical GIS of Holocaust ghettos. The process foregrounds collaborative design, testing that purposely flushes out paradigmatic differences and ontological problems, and revision to incorporate group decisions and agreed-upon meanings into data structures, field definitions, and instructions for data entry. The result is a deeply integrative form of mixed methodology that incorporates ethical standards along with data entry instructions and team training. ",

We layer these images with a published, geo-referenced collection of Land Survey Maps of China (1903–1948), which includes the earliest large-scale maps of major cities and regions in China that are produced with modern cartographic techniques. By bringing together historical illustrations depicting spatial configurations of localities and the earliest modern cartographic maps, researchers of Chinese history can study the different spatial epistemologies represented in both collections. We report our workflow for creating this web GIS platform, starting from identifying and extracting visual materials from local gazetteers, tagging them with keywords and categories to facilitate content search, to georeferencing them based on their source locations. We also experimented with neural networks to train a tagger with positive results. Finally, we display them in the web GIS platform with two modes, Images in Map (IIM) and Maps in Map (MIM), and with content- and location-based filtering. These features together enable researchers easy and quick exploration and comparison of these two large sets of geospatial and visual materials of China. ",

        "abstract": " Finding and selecting interesting and relevant information in large online digital text archives can be challenging. We tackle this information access problem from a geographic information science perspective using a case study exploring a semi-structured historical encyclopedia. We propose a three-pronged approach for this, based around (1) automatic retrieval of spatio-temporal and thematic information from digital text documents; (2) transformation of the extracted information to spatialize and visualize spatio-temporal and thematic structures; and (3) integration of the spatialized displays in an interactive web interface driven by a user-centered design and evaluation approach. We implemented an interactive spatialized network display to allow identification of spatio-temporal relationships hidden in the text archive, complemented by an interactive self-organizing map display to visualize thematic relationships in these text documents. We evaluated the utility and usability of the developed interface in a user study with digital humanities scholars. Empirical results show that the developed interface supports target users in the humanities uncovering latent spatio-temporal and thematic relationships and generated new insights through the spatialized text collection. Adopting this approach, we illustrate one avenue to addressing the information access problem in the digital humanities from a GIScience perspective. ",

The authors offer a rationale for using historical maps and GIS with timestamps, discuss the challenges posed by a multilingual historical dataset with partially imprecise or inferred information, and share their approach to overcoming these challenges in data collection, the creation of gazetteer, and timecoding. Despite focusing on travelogues, these tools and approaches are transferable to the visualisation and analysis of other texts in which chronotopes matter. ",

        "abstract": " Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize winning counter-western Lonesome Dove (part of a tetralogy, set between 1840 and 1900) and the works of LA Noir detective fiction writers (from the 1940s to 1997) represent the American west and urban southwest of Los Angeles as a dynamic mosaic of human and environmental borderlandscapes. McMurtry's perspective provides an Anglo-European eye, influenced by Cervantean Iberian literary tropes on the transformation of the West from indigenous and Spanish trails to American rail-road tracks. The LA Noirscapes map phenomenologically illustrates how the location of novel settings cluster in contiguous and convergent places on a street grid palimpsest of Los Angeles between 1949 and 1997. Employing HumGIS methods, this essay considers the marriage of empirical cartography and impressionistic topography; the former concerned with latitude, longitude and space, the latter with plotting literary, historical and cultural perceptions and experiences of place. By engaging the concept of Euclidian space with the phenomenology of place, geographers can contextualize field work, and other methods with literary, cartographical and GIS analysis to uncover the means to craft new avenues to study the dynamic and symbiotic formations of historical landscapes, identities, senses of place and location.

        "abstract": " This exposition presents little-known connections between geography, through geographic information systems (GISs), mathematics, through matrix algebra, and art, through paintings and images, adding to the geo-humanities, spatial humanities, and humanistic mathematics literature. To this end, findings summarized for spatial statistical analyses of selected Susie Rosmarin paintings (which are reminiscent of visualizations of certain mathematical quantities known as eigenvectors), remotely sensed images that have appeared in art exhibits, and selected famous paintings by historically renowned artists reveal that spatial autocorrelation constitutes a fundamental element of art. These analyses extend the tradition of visualizing fractals as art, and interfacing cartography with art. This paper promotes analytical art, and establishes additional commonalities for GIScience, mathematics, and art. ",

Despite the many successes of scientifically-oriented archaeology, we contend that our discipline cannot achieve its broader aims without the humanities. We illustrate our argument by delineating three research domains – Deep Time Perspectives, Spatial Histories, and Public Engagement – and reviewing recent studies in each that have successfully integrated scientific and humanistic approaches to spatial archaeology.

        "abstract": " The importance of spatial precision in geographic information science is not limited to quantitative data. As spatial data can also exist in qualitative form, modifying a discourse quality index from the field of discourse ethics can help understand whether mentioning specific spatial locations changes the quality of spatial narratives. The discourse quality index was modified by incorporating an item into the index that detected the presence and magnitude of a spatial precision construct. The spatial narratives analyzed with this modified index were 151 public comments submitted during a public policy revision process, for a national forest plan revision at the Chugach National Forest in Alaska, USA. Analysis showed when discourse quality values underwent a comparison of means test, the values were significantly changed between comments with no spatial precision versus those considered to have spatial precision. The results suggest, preliminarily, that employing spatial precision in narratives changes discourse quality during deliberative activities. Further, the way in which people use spatial precision to communicate during a policy revision process can impact how spatial narratives are understood and valued. ",

        "abstract": " Researchers from the spatial humanities can play an active role in the ongoing discussion around representation and uncertainty in geosocial data. Opportunistic geosocial data from crowdsourced and user contributions are typically available in large quantities, however, these data are generally not sampled or collected with intentionality for research purposes. Therefore, digital traces from geolocationally-enabled devices may not provide data that are directly relevant to addressing precise questions or being used in applications of societal interest. It is crucial to first understand characteristics of geosocial data prior to proceeding with interpretation. The spatial humanities could encourage realization of the role data analysts and researchers play in creating narrative in light of large opportunistic data with many facets of uncertainty. An approach is proposed that suggests directions of inquiry into data limitations based on the characteristics of the source and the properties of the data. Finally, this article notes that the digital world influences the activities of individuals in real-life so the generalizability of the behaviour of users may be limited. Integrating other forms of relevant spatial data can help to bound uncertainty and constrain the interpretation of geosocial data. ",

        "abstract": " Most people in developed countries, and many in developing countries, interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed algorithms on an almost daily basis, yet very few are aware of those interactions or of their effect upon people's daily lives.1 Using machine learning, automated reasoning, and other forms of AI, algorithms deployed in information systems take actions according to criteria set up by software developers to maximize profits regardless of the overall effects on the autonomy or welfare of individuals or on society as a whole.2 Those criteria almost always involve location-based and place-based data. In this paper, we consider effects of those computational tools on individual choice and autonomy and on societal structure from the humanistic perspectives of philosophy and jurisprudence. Specifically, we: •review contemporaneous literature and quantitative economic evidence on the effects of pervasive tracking and algorithmic controls on individuals and on society in general, •summarize a range of suggested solutions for lessening the adverse effects, and •describe and expand upon selected legal solutions from the literature.
