They realize the fragility of works based on electronic modules, subject to technology changes. Sustainability can be achieved in four different ways that are examined in this article: preservation, emulation, migration and virtualization. We discuss these issues, showing the first steps towards solutions at Ircam in the framework of the European project Caspar.",

Interest in the semantic Web has revived the dream, but many are sceptical. This article offers a breakthrough to problems of semantic interoperability and defends the feasibility of a global knowledge network against traditional counterarguments. It offers a new approach based on (i) interdisciplinary research of scholarly and scientific discourse, (ii) a generic global ontological model based on relations and co-reference rather than objects, (iii) semi-automatic maintenance of co-reference links, and (iv) public engagement in the creation and development of the network.",

        "abstract": "This article describes an approach to transdisciplinary information integration employing a core ontology. Information is modeled here with an ontology based on the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model (ISO 21127). When instantiated with some realistic examples taken from the field of biodiversity (collecting, determination, type creation, expedition, and observation events), the formal specification of semantic concepts makes scientific activities commonly understandable. Ontologies not only allow one to describe the results of scientific activities, such as a description of a biological species, but they can help to clarify the path by which the goal was reached. In particular, they provide a high-level uniform representation of transdisciplinary research activities and results. Ontologies as knowledge representation tools will therefore have strong impact on methodological questions and research strategies for different domains such as biology, archaeology, art history, and socio-economy. They can be regarded as semantic glue between and within scientific and scholarly domains as demonstrated in a series of examples. Following this approach, some requirements for research and development of integrated IT environments between memory instutions are derived.",

Detailed and accurate digital 3D models can be produced with 3D scanning devices, which allow conversion of reality into digital form in a cost and time-effective manner. We present the capabilities of this technology and the main issues which are preventing its wider use in contemporary applications, highlighting some open problems and a few promising new approaches for 3D model construction. We also briefly review some CH applications which could boost the diffusion and evolution of 3D scanning technology.",

        "abstract": "The current methods to describe the shape of three-dimensional objects can be classified into two groups: methods following the composition of primitives approach and descriptions based on procedural shape representations. As a 3D acquisition device returns an agglomeration of elementary objects (e.g. a laser scanner returns points), the model acquisition pipeline always starts with a composition of primitives. Due to the semantic information carried with a generative description, a procedural model provides valuable metadata that make up the basis for digital library services: retrieval, indexing, and searching.An important challenge in computer graphics in the field of cultural heritage is to build a bridge between the generative and the explicit geometry description combining both worlds—the accuracy and systematics of generative models with the realism and the irregularity of real-world data. A first step towards a semantically enriched data description is a reconstruction algorithm based on decreasing exponential fitting. This approach is robust towards outliers and multiple dataset mixtures. It does not need a preceding segmentation and is able to fit a generative shape template to a point cloud identifying the parameters of a shape.",

        "abstract": "Traveling through a single virtual environment only tells part of the story; a particularly interesting aspect is to illustrate how an area has developed over time. This article presents a unified approach to illustrating four-dimensional data concerning a cultural heritage site. The proposed framework provides a semi-automatic approach to both reconstructing the environment and bringing all the time-dependent models into an intuitive visualization package. For each time period considered for reconstruction, the system requires a set of building footprint maps depicting the layout of the environment plus a few statistics. The statistics govern the construction of three-dimensional building models, allowing each building's architectural style, typical building height, and roof style to be altered. This information is automatically processed and converted into a form that can be visualized. By integrating high quality landmark buildings from laser scanning or interactive modelling packages into the automatically generated scene, the cultural heritage site is realized both in a spatial and temporal context. The visualization is achieved via a 4D navigable movie which is presented using two concrete implementations written using Flash and OpenGL. The OpenGL-based implementation allows a collection of 3DS Max scenes to be automatically visualized requiring only a set of camera paths identified by the user.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we propose a general computational model for the extraction of symmetry features of Islamic geometrical patterns' (IGP) images. We describe IGP images using the discrete symmetry groups theory. Our model contains the three following steps. (1) By noting that these patterns fall into three major categories, we begin our indexation process by classifying every pattern into one of these categories. The first pattern category describes all the patterns generated by translation along one direction. Every pattern of this category can be classified into one of the seven Frieze groups. The second type of pattern contains translational symmetries in two independent directions. Patterns of this category can be classified into one of the seventeen Wallpaper groups. The last type, called rosettes, describes patterns which begin at a central point and grow radially outward. We use rosette symmetry groups to classify patterns of this latter category. (2) For every pattern, we extract the symmetry features, namely, the symmetry group and the fundamental region, which is a representative region in the image from which the whole image can be regenerated. But for rosette groups, we can also compute the number of folds. (3) Finally, we describe the fundamental region by a simple color histogram and build the feature vector which is a combination of the symmetry feature (defined in the second step) and histogram information. Experiments show promising results for either IGP images' classification or indexing. Efforts for the subsequent task of classifying Islamic geometrical patterns' images can be significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "This research addresses the question of what is an acceptable period between conservation treatments. Taking the cleaning of impressionist paintings as a case study, survival analysis is carried out on metadata from conservation records for the Tate, UK, the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, and the National Trust, UK. Currently the only guidance available is offered by the National Trust. Based on cost-benefit analysis, it suggests an interval of 25 years for light surface cleaning and 100 years for major treatment. The majority of paintings held by the National Trust are pre-20th century, with a varnish layer protecting the paint surface. Arguments are put forward that this guidance cannot be applied to unvarnished paintings with exposed ground and a fragile paint layer. The cleaning process for these types of paintings poses a greater risk as it inevitably causes some loss of paint. Any cleaning of paintings in this category is more akin to a major conservation treatment. The Kaplan Meier Product Limit estimator uses metadata collected from the conservation records to estimate an average inter-cleaning period for the Tate, UK, and National Gallery, Oslo. The result of the theoretical analysis, although highly dependent on the quality of conservation records available, is supplemented by evidence from practical experience. Current views on acceptable frequency of cleaning and the associated risks of treatment are sought using a survey of conservators with experience of treating impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. This is applied to a case study of the Munch paintings in the University Aula, Oslo, that are currently unacceptably dirty. In the past, these paintings have been cleaned on average once every 14 years, which is clearly too often. The results suggest that the intercleaning period should be increased by a factor of three. Criteria are discussed for improving the environment within the University Aula, Oslo, to achieve this goal.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, the number of projects involving historical reconstruction has increased significantly. Recent technologies have proven a powerful tool for a better understanding of our cultural heritage through which to attain a glimpse of the environments in which our ancestors lived. However, to accomplish such a purpose, these reconstructions should be presented to us as they may really have been perceived by a local inhabitant, according to the illumination and materials used back then and, equally important, the characteristics of the human visual system.The human visual system has a remarkable ability to adjust itself to almost all everyday scenarios. This is particularly evident in extreme lighting conditions, such as bright light or dark environments. However, a major portion of the visible spectra captured by our visual system cannot be represented in most display devices. High dynamic range imagery is a field of research which is developing techniques to correct such inaccuracies. This new viewing paradigm is perfectly suited for archaeological interpretation, since its high contrast and chromaticity can present us with an enhanced viewing experience, closer to what an inhabitant of that era may have seen.In this article we present a case study of the reconstruction of a Roman site. We generate high dynamic range images of mosaics and frescoes from one of the most impressive monuments in the ruins of Conimbriga, Portugal, an ancient city of the Roman Empire. To achieve the requisite level of precision, in addition to having a precise geometric 3D model, it is crucial to integrate in the virtual simulation authentic physical data of the light used in the period under consideration. Therefore, in order to create a realistic physical-based environment, we use in our lighting simulations real data obtained from simulated Roman luminaries of that time.",

        "abstract": "The article reports the interdisciplinary project of the virtualization of the Great Inscription of Gortyna, Crete, for 3D documentation, structural studies, and physical replica purposes. The digitization of the longest epigraphic text of the Greek civilization (6 m long and 1.75 m high, with approximately 2--3 mm-depth engraved letters) and its surrounding heritage area (around 30 × 30 m), required long planning and the construction of a dedicated acquisition system to speed up the surveying time, limited to few hours per day. Primarily, range sensors were employed in a multi-resolution way, digitizing detailed parts in high resolution and less smoothed areas with lower geometric resolution. Some selected areas were also modeled with our multiphoto geometrically constrained image matching approach to demonstrate that the same accuracy and details can be achieved using either scanners or photogrammetry. The derived 3D model of the heritage is now the basis for further archaeological studies on the incision techniques and a deeper structural analysis on the monument. The challenges of the work stay in the acquisition, processing, and integration of the multi-resolution data as well as their interactive visualization.",

        "abstract": "In this article, the wind flow over one of the most important Egyptian historical heritage sites, the Giza Plateau, was investigated using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) state-of-the-art techniques. The present study addresses the influences of wind flow structure, as an important denudation factor, on the site and its famous monuments: the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx. Three-dimensional CFD simulations have been performed based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for the cases of the northwest wind, at the average wind speed over the year, and the southwest windstorms. In addition, the wind-driven sand was considered for the same cases. Particular attention was paid to the Great Sphinx and the Pyramids to investigate their parts most vulnerable to the wind, which is contributing to the erosion of these monuments. The Great Sphinx was buried by sand and it was cleared several times throughout its history. In this study, we also address the less understood, yet important, burial mechanism of the Great Sphinx. The present work may give more insight to the effect of wind around the Giza Plateau when developing a global plan for conserving and protecting the site.",

We advocate open repositories of scientifically authenticated 3D models based on the example of traditional scholarly journals, with standard mechanisms for preservation, peer review, publication, updating, and dissemination of the 3D models. However, fully realizing this vision will require addressing a number of related research challenges.In this article, we first give a brief background of the virtual heritage discipline, and characterize the need for centralized 3D archives, including a preliminary needs assessment survey of virtual heritage practitioners. Then we describe several existing 3D cultural heritage repositories, and enumerate a number of technical research challenges that should be addressed to realize an ideal archive. These challenges include digital rights management for the 3D models, clear depiction of uncertainty in 3D reconstructions, version control for 3D models, effective metadata structures, long-term preservation, interoperability, and 3D searching. Other concerns are provision for the application of computational analysis tools, and the organizational structure of a peer-reviewed 3D model archive.",

However, deriving a visitor's profile is not an easy task, since most common ways (asking direct questions, recording user actions) are either intrusive or time consuming. Observing the visitors' movement (visiting style) within the museum could provide valuable information regarding adaptivity. In the present study, issues of visiting style were explored and statistical significance was found once different factors were analyzed. Most importantly, there seems to be a connection between the way people move in a museum and the way they prefer to approach and process information cognitively. Environmental factors that can affect the expression of visiting style were also identified.",

        "abstract": "We propose a set of dynamic shading enhancement techniques for improving the perception of details, features, and overall shape characteristics from images created with Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) techniques. Selection of these perceptual enhancement filters can significantly improve the user's ability to interactively inspect the content of 2D RTI media by zooming, panning, and changing the illumination direction. In particular, we present two groups of strategies for RTI image enhancement based on two main ideas: exploiting the unsharp masking methodology in the RTI-specific context; and locally optimizing the incident light direction for improved RTI image sharpness and illumination of surface features. The Result section will present a number of datasets and compare them with existing techniques.",

        "abstract": "The Chinese zither, called guqin, has existed for over 3,000 years and always played an important role in Chinese social history. An interesting but unfortunate fact is that the traditional notation of guqin music does not provide the duration information for each music note which requires the player to learn from his teacher and memorize. As a result, among several thousands of compositions that have been created and recorded with guqin music notation, only around 100 of them are still being played today. In this article we use a machine learning method to study the guqin music recovery problem which tries to use the guqin music notation to recover the duration of each music note. Information provided by the music note is used as features to predict the duration information with a support vector machine. The experimental result shows that our system can predict with fair accuracy, and can be used as a valuable reference for human guqin masters to recover guqin music.",

        "abstract": "ArcheoTUI is a new tangible user interface for the efficient assembly of the 3D scanned fragments of fractured archeological objects. An efficient user interaction for the complex task to orientate or position two 3D objects relative to each other is essential, eventually in addition to automatic matching techniques.Our key idea is to use tangible props for the manipulation of the virtual fragments. In each hand, the user manipulates an electromagnetically tracked prop, and the translations and rotations are directly mapped to the corresponding virtual fragments on the display.For each hand, a corresponding foot pedal is used to clutch the movements of the hands. Hence, the user's hands can be repositioned, or the user can be switched. The software of ArcheoTUI is designed to easily change assembly hypotheses, beyond classical undo/redo, by using a scene graph.We designed ArcheoTUI on the demand of archeaologists and in a direct collaboration with them, and we conducted two user studies on site at their workplace. The first user study revealed that the interface, and especially the foot pedal, was accepted, and that all the users managed to solve simple assembly tasks. In a second user study, we compare a different clutching mechanism with buttons on the props to the foot pedal mechanism. This second user study revealed that the movement of the hands is more similar to real-world assembly scenarios when using the foot pedals, and that the users can keep on concentrating on the actual assembly task.Finally, we show how the virtual assembly is used for a fractured archeological finding.",

        "abstract": "In this article, an integrated conjecture about the method of drawing of monumental prehistoric wall-paintings is presented and supported. Specifically, the article deals with paintings that initially decorated the internal walls of the highest floor of a building, called “Xeste 3”, at Akrotiri of the Greek island of Thera circa. 1650 B.C. It is argued that these wall-paintings could had been drawn while the brush was guided by an apparatus, which corresponds to advanced for the era of geometric prototypes with impressive precision. A set of assumptions concerning the actions the artists might have taken in order to create the spiral themes is stated and supported. These assumptions refer to the existence of a draft plan, the sequence of brush strokes, the placement of the brush on the wall, as well as the possible form of the apparatus. These conjectures are evaluated and tested by means of curve fitting and image analysis methods developed by the authors. The results indicate that all drawn contour parts optimally fit along a single prototype linear spiral with fitting error of less than 0.4mm, supporting existence of a very advanced culture for the era of geometric guide. It is statistically rejected that this guide could have the form of a stamp. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the painter might have used a draft plan of the spiral themes to prepare the final drawing and that the linear spiral guide has been used by alternating its placements in order to form the internal and external spiral contour.",

        "abstract": "Even decades after the advent of computer technology, preserving information in digital archives remains a challenging task. Technological progress on all levels calls for migration as an essential component of any digital archive. Migration, however, is not only expensive, but also makes it difficult to ensure the authenticity of digital documents. The University of Basel's Imaging and Media Lab has developed PEVIAR (Permanent Visual Archive), an archiving solution addressing one of the fundamental challenges of digital archiving, migration, and introducing the notion of digital originals. Essentially, digital documents are inseparably bound to a migration-free medium, thereby overcoming the transient nature of today's state-of-the-art storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Flash light of digital cameras is a very useful way to picture scenes with low-quality illumination. Nevertheless, especially in low-end cameras integrated flash lights are considered as not reliable for high-quality images, due to known artifacts (sharp shadows, highlights, uneven lighting) generated in images. Moreover, a mathematical model of this kind of light is difficult to create. In this article we present a color correction space which, given some information about the geometry of the pictured scene, is able to provide a space-dependent color correction for each pixel of the image. The correction space can be calculated once in a lifetime using a quite fast acquisition procedure; after 3D spatial calibration, the obtained color correction function can be applied to every image where flash is the dominant light source. We developed this approach to produce better color samples in the application framework of color mapping on 3D scanned models. The correction space proposed presents several advantages: it is independent from the kind of light used (provided that it is bound to the camera), it gives the possibility to correct some artifacts (for example, color deviation) introduced by flash light, and it has a wide range of possible applications, from image enhancement to material color estimation. Moreover, once that the inverse photo-to-geometry transformation is known, it allows the easy estimation of the flash light position and permits to identify and remove other annoying artifacts, like highlights and shadows. The resulting approach allows to gather in an easy manner a better and more consistent color information and to produce higher-quality 3D models.",

        "abstract": "The dichotomy between full detail representation and the efficient management of data digitization is still a big issue in the context of the acquisition and visualization of 3D objects, especially in the field of the cultural heritage. Modern scanning devices enable very detailed geometry to be acquired, but it is usually quite hard to apply these technologies to large artifacts. In this article we present a project aimed at virtually reconstructing the impressive (7×11 m.) portal of the Ripoll Monastery, Spain. The monument was acquired using triangulation laser scanning technology, producing a dataset of 2212 range maps for a total of more than 1 billion triangles. All the steps of the entire project are described, from the acquisition planning to the final setup for dissemination to the public. We show how time-of-flight laser scanning data can be used to speed-up the alignment process. In addition we show how, after creating a model and repairing imperfections, an interactive and immersive setup enables the public to navigate and display a fully detailed representation of the portal. This article shows that, after careful planning and with the aid of state-of-the-art algorithms, it is now possible to preserve and visualize highly detailed information, even for very large surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Technology can play a crucial role in supporting museum visitors and enhancing their overall museum visit experiences. Visitors coming to a museum do not want to be overloaded with information, but to receive the relevant information, learn, and have an overall interesting experience. To serve this goal, a user-friendly and flexible system is needed. The design of such a system poses several challenges that need to be addressed in parallel. The user interface should be intuitive and let the visitors focus on the exhibits, not on the technology. Content and delivery must provide relevant information and at the same time allow visitors to get the level of detail and the perspectives in which they are interested. Personalization may play a key role in providing relevant information to individuals. Yet, since visitors tend to visit the museum in small groups, technology should also contribute to and facilitate during-the-visit communication or post-visit group interaction. The PIL project applied at the Hecht museum extended the research results of the PEACH project and tried to address all of these considerations. Evaluation involving users substantiated several aspects of the design.",

        "abstract": "Exhibits within cultural heritage collections such as museums and art galleries are arranged by experts with intimate knowledge of the domain, but there may exist connections between individual exhibits that are not evident in this representation. For example, the visitors to such a space may have their own opinions on how exhibits relate to one another. In this article, we explore the possibility of estimating the perceived relatedness of exhibits by museum visitors through a variety of ontological and document similarity-based methods. Specifically, we combine the Wikipedia category hierarchy with lexical similarity measures, and evaluate the correlation with the relatedness judgements of visitors. We compare our measure with simple document similarity calculations, based on either Wikipedia documents or Web pages taken from the Web site for the museum of interest. We also investigate the hypothesis that physical distance in the museum space is a direct representation of the conceptual distance between exhibits. We demonstrate that ontological similarity measures are highly effective at capturing perceived relatedness and that the proposed RACO (Related Article Conceptual Overlap) method is able to achieve results closest to relatedness judgements provided by human annotators compared to existing state-of-the art measures of semantic relatedness.",

The guqin has its own special notation composed of reduced characters. The input system of the guqin notation is necessary for digital storage and analysis of guqin notation. This article presents the first handwriting input system of guqin notation. This system adopts a radical-based approach. In this approach, the radicals of the input reduced character are extracted first. Next the layout template that best matches the character is found. The name of the character can then be interpreted according to the radicals and the matching layout template. Radical extraction is the key step of any radical-based approach. In this article a method of radical extraction for online cursive characters is proposed. Experimental results show that the approach is efficient and that the input system performs well.",

        "abstract": "Modeling human argumentation should shed light on how knowledge described in information systems could be better accessed, structured, and used for real life research purposes. Current argumentation models are either not analytical enough or restricted to formal logic. For that purpose, we seek a model of human argumentation in which reasoning may not only consist of falsification or verification but more generally of strengthening or weakening hypotheses, and a way to connect this model to an ontology of the domain of discourse. We have studied examples of factual argumentation in empirical research in archaeology. Based on this and other empirical material, we propose an innovative integrated model of factual argumentation that includes evolution, composition, and revision of arguments. It makes explicit both the processes of argument-making and the states of belief at a particular point in time in a composite inference, and connects explicitly to a domain ontology, free of tacit background knowledge. We have implemented the model in a more restricted form and tested it with published archaeological examples. Future work may generalize the model to other kinds of argumentation.",

We present an ontology-based approach for designing a cultural heritage repository for that purpose. Since dance and music are recorded in multimedia format, we use Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) to encode the domain knowledge. We propose an architectural framework that includes a method to construct the ontology with a labeled set of training data and use of the ontology to automatically annotate new instances of digital heritage artifacts. The annotations enable creation of a semantic navigation environment in a cultural heritage repository. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach by constructing an ontology for the cultural heritage domain of Indian classical dance, and have developed a browsing application for semantic access to the heritage collection of Indian dance videos.",

There are two types of approaches: unified approaches, that is, one detector for all gradual transition types, and approaches that use specialized detectors for each gradual transition type. We present an overview on existing methods and extend an existing unified approach for the detection of gradual transitions in historic material. In an experimental study, we evaluate the proposed approach on complex and low-quality historic material as well as on contemporary material from the TRECVid evaluation. Additionally, we investigate different features, feature combinations, and fusion strategies. We observe that the historic material requires the use of texture features, in contrast to the contemporary material that, in most of the cases, requires the use of color and luminance features.",

The surveys were performed with a new photogrammetric technique, Spherical Photogrammetry, developed by Gabriele Fangi [2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]. The method is based on so-called spherical panoramas. These are obtained by stitching together several pictures taken from the same point and covering 360°, which are then mapped in a plane with an equi-rectangular projection. This technique is normally used to produce QuickTime movies which have already proven to be very useful for the documentation of cultural heritage. One panorama can replace many normal photographic images. Ease, rapidity, low cost, and completeness of the documentation are the main advantages of this technique.The Abbey of San Galgano is an important example of Gothic architecture in Italy. The church is empty and without its roof, which fell towards the end of the 18th century. The photogrammetric survey was done in November 2009. Thirty-four panoramas were taken outside, around the perimeter of the complex, and 22 were taken inside the church. The Roman theatre of Sabratha, built in the 2nd century AD, was rebuilt in the years between 1930-1940 at the command of the Italian governor of Libya, Italo Balbo, as a rememberance of the past Roman Empire. The project was handled by two Italian archaeologists Caputo [1953] and Guidi [1935]. The photogrammetric survey was done in August 2009 with 22 panoramas taken around and inside the monument. These two projects are limited in their scope, not covering the geometry of the entire monuments. The time and the available resources did not permit a complete survey. The purpose of the two projects was not to satisfy the needs of a client, but only to demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of the approach. In these two projects accuracy tests were not made, but in other projects accuracy was found to be on the order of 1/1000 the object distance, say one centimeter every ten meters of distance from the object [Fangi 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2009, 2010].",

        "abstract": "One of the main problems faced during reconstruction of fractured archaeological artifacts is sorting through a large number of candidate matches between fragments to find the relatively few that are correct. Previous computer methods for this task provided scoring functions based on a variety of properties of potential matches, including color and geometric compatibility across fracture surfaces. However, they usually consider only one or at most a few properties at once, and therefore provide match predictions with very low precision. In this article, we investigate a machine learning approach that computes the probability that a match is correct based on the combination of many features. We explore this machine learning approach for ranking matches in three different sets of fresco fragments, finding that classifiers based on many match properties can be significantly more effective at ranking proposed matches than scores based on any single property alone. Our results suggest that it is possible to train a classifier on match properties in one dataset and then use it to rank predicted matches in another dataset effectively. We believe that this approach could be helpful in a variety of cultural heritage reconstruction systems.",

Our method does not require meshing or extensive processing of the input model, works on a coarsely spatially reordered point stream, and can adaptively refine point cloud geometry on the basis of image content. Seamless multiband image blending is obtained by using GPU-accelerated screen-space operators, which solve point set visibility, compute a per-pixel view-dependent weight, and ensure a smooth weighting function over each input image. The proposed approach works independently on each image in a memory-coherent manner, and can be easily extended to include further image-quality estimators. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a series of massive real-world point datasets.",

Starting from high-resolution images of original paintings, our process allows an artist to quickly design the desired form, and generate data suitable for rapid prototyping machines to produce the physical touch tools. Laser-cut layered depth diagrams convey not only the individual objects in the painting and their spatial layout, but also augment their depth relations. CNC-milled textured reliefs additionally render fine details like brush strokes and texture suitable for the sense of touch. Our methods mimic aspects of the visual sense, make sure that the haptic output is quite faithful to the original paintings, and do not require special manual abilities like sculpting skills.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a general framework for the retrieval of artistic line-drawings is introduced. It relies on the pictorial content, defined as a combination of the stylistic content and the visual features of the represented subject. First, we propose an automatic method for the extraction of stroke contours in line drawings, relying on a filtering of the level lines of images. Next, the radius of the drawing tool is estimated from these segmented strokes. This information then efficiently tunes the extraction of several geometric features, including the distribution of curvature, endpoints, junctions and corners of strokes. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated with several experiments on two classified databases of artistic line-drawings, and compared with an approach based on the curvature scale space (CSS). Retrieval experiments suggest that the proposed framework is able to handle the pictorial effect delivered by line drawings to a human observer.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces a model and a system for embodied social active listening to sound and music content. The model is based on the simultaneous navigation/exploration of multiple maps, starting from a low-level physical map, up to a high-level emotional, affective map. The paper discusses the concepts underlying such a model, the system implementing it, and two concrete examples: The Orchestra Explorer designed for the Museo degli Strumenti Musicali at Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Roma, Italy, and the interactive dance and music performance The Bow Is bent and Drawn (composer Nicola Ferrari), presented at Casa Paganini, Genova, Italy, in occasion of the opening concert of the 8th Intl. Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME08), June 4, 2008, and in museum interactive experiences at Festival della Scienza, Genova. This work is part of current research at Casa Paganini—InfoMus on embodied social active listening to sound and music content through the analysis and processing of expressiveness in human full-body movement and gesture. A user-centric interactive multimedia system architecture is proposed, operating on prerecorded music. From the perspective of valorization of cultural heritage, this research provides engaging paradigms of interaction with prerecorded music content, enabling a large number of nonexpert users to rediscover the musical heritage (e.g., classical and contemporary music) they may not be familiar with. Research was carried out in the framework of the EU-ICT Project SAME (Sound and Music for Everyone, Everyday, Everywhere, Every Way, www.sameproject.eu, 2008–2010) and has been recently extended to active experience of audiovisual content, and in particular to cultural heritage and museum scenarios: the novel interactive permanent museum exhibition Viaggiatori di Sguardo has been designed and developed at Palazzo Ducale, Genova, enabling visitors to explore virtually the UNESCO Heritage Palazzi dei Rolli in Genova.",

        "abstract": "Digital documentation and reconstruction is a comparatively recent phenomenon in the history of architectural heritage documentation and conservation. It has emerged as a result of technological development, especially in computer applications that have extended our capabilities to cope up with the knowledge systems of increasing broad range and complexity.For most people, including architects, heritage and conservation mean historical buildings and their conservation. However, there is another facet to it that is not well recognized; the area of “literary architectural heritage, ” that is, the literature on historical architecture. In the literary architectural heritage of India, many architectural treatises are available for graphical documentation of the built examples described in them. This article aims to present digital graphical documentation of the pavilions described in the Mayamatam, an architectural treatise of ancient India.Research in this area will enrich the knowledge base of architecture. Having this information in a digital format like CAD drawings, virtual 3D models would result in better communication, storage, and retrieval for editing, modifications, and analysis. This digital documentation and representation provides the possibility of being used as a teaching aid for students and architects and also for recovering lost knowledge in the context of partially destroyed structures. For architects and designers, who constantly search for new ways, the digital presentation of ancient Indian pavilions provide a design tool for discovering new patterns to be used in contemporary architecture.",

        "abstract": "The aim of our project, Last House on the Hill (LHotH), is to holistically reconstitute the rich multimedia and primary research data with the impressive texts of the monograph, the printed final report of the Berkeley Archaeologists at Çatalhöyük (BACH) project, in which a team from UC Berkeley excavated a group of Neolithic 9000-year old buildings at this famous cultural heritage location in Central Anatolia, Turkey. The Last House on the Hill brings together the published text, complete project database (including all media formats such as photographs, videos, maps, line drawings), related Web sites, data and media outside the direct domain of the BACH project, and recontextualized presentations of the data as remixes, movies, and other interpretive works by BACH team members and many others. We are achieving this through an event-centered, CIDOC-CRM-compatible implementation ontology, expressed through an open-source Web publishing platform, providing open access, transparency and open-endedness to what is normally the closed and final process of monograph publication.The idea of embedding, interweaving, entangling, and otherwise linking the data and media from archaeological excavations with their interpretation and meaningful presentation in an open access sharable platform has long been an ambition of those of us working in the digital documentation of archaeological research and the public presentation of cultural heritage. Formidable barriers still exist to making it possible for projects to achieve these aims, ranging from intellectual property concerns to providing commitments to the long-term sustainability of the digital content. We believe that our event-centered implementation ontology will make it far easier for archaeologists and researchers in other disciplines to organize, manage, and share their data while gaining the significant benefits of the CIDOC-CRM framework.This article describes the strategy, goals, architecture, and implementation for the project, emphasizing the novel and innovative approaches that were required to make the project successful.",

The usability test was conducted to determine if computer technology such as smartpens can provide an effective tool in the Tribe's home-based education initiative. Previous efforts in the use of computer technology language revitalization are reviewed and found to offer promise. The smartpen technology is reviewed, the interactive booklets and programmed smartpen are described, and usability test results are analyzed. Encouraging findings have led to interest in further development of additional technological tools that could be incorporated into “home learning kits.” Additionally, by interchanging sound files, the smartpen software can be adapted easily to support language revitalization work by other communities.",

The first experiment consisted in evaluating UML class diagrams and a conceptual graph. The second experiment evaluated a value cluster modeling approach. These qualitative evaluations were conducted using focus groups composed of cultural heritage specialists. We evaluated the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, and the intention to use of the three techniques (UML class diagrams, conceptual graphs, and the value cluster approach). Thanks to these evaluations, we will be able to propose a combined approach using value cluster modeling and UML class diagraming techniques to describe cultural heritage information.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of visual art is a highly complex cognitive task that depends on the very many aspects of the art as well as complex brain connectivity, and the examination of visual art and the analysis of influential links between artists and artistic movements require the trained eye of knowledgeable art historians. However, while the human eye and brain can perceive visual art and notice the differences, similarities, and influential links between painters, computers employing artificial intelligence find this task far more challenging. In this article we show that computers can automatically analyze paintings of different artists and different schools of art in an unsupervised fashion. Experimental results show that the automatic computer analysis can group artists by their artistic movements, and provide a map of similarities and influential links that is largely in agreement with the analysis of art historians. These results demonstrate that machine vision and pattern recognition algorithms are able to mimic the complex cognitive task of the human perception of visual art, and can be used to measure and quantify visual similarities between paintings, painters, and schools of art.",

The painting was created with moving focus drawing technique without rigorous perspective. A novel algorithm is proposed to infer the 3D space of the painting according to its layout and embed the audio annotations. For exhibition, the masterpiece is scanned into a high-resolution gigapixel image for presenting the drawing details, and we develop an interactive multimedia system with a panning and zooming interface to enable smooth navigation on the giant painting and exploring the historical culture. During the navigation, the system estimates the 3D position of the user's viewpoint from his/her actions, and subsequently synthesizes a realistic stereo audio field according to the viewer's orientation and distance from the annotations in the 3D space. The proposed system provides an immersive user experience by rendering a visual-audio consistent perception.",

Using the example of the evolution of German past tenses, we show how a variety of categories ranging from low to high complexity interact with the choice between competing linguistic variants. To adequately explore the influence of these categories, we use a multilayer corpus architecture that develops together with our study. We show that a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses can recognize relevant contextual factors, which feed into the addition of new annotation layers applying to the same data. By making our categorizations explicit as corpus annotations and our data available to other researchers, we promote an open, extensible, and transparent mode of research, where both raw data and the inferential process are exposed to other researchers.",

Most of this work currently receives little, if any, attention. The collection is too large to be read by any single person and mostly not of sufficient interest to warrant traditional close reading. This article presents computational methods for identifying patterns and testing hypotheses about Classics as a field. Such tools can help organize large collections, introduce younger scholars to the history of the field, and act as a “survey,” identifying anomalies that can be explored using more traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of large open digitization projects such as the Internet Archive and Google Books, we are witnessing an explosive growth in the number of source texts becoming available to researchers in historical languages. The Internet Archive alone contains over 27,014 texts catalogued as Latin, including classical prose and poetry written under the Roman Empire, ecclesiastical treatises from the Middle Ages, and dissertations from 19th-century Germany written—in Latin—on the philosophy of Hegel. At one billion words, this collection eclipses the extant corpus of Classical Latin by several orders of magnitude. In addition, the much larger collection of books in English, German, French, and other languages already scanned contains unknown numbers of translations for many Latin books, or parts of books.The sheer scale of this collection offers a broad vista of new research questions, and we focus here on both the opportunities and challenges of computing over such a large space of heterogeneous texts. The works in this massive collection do not constitute a finely curated (or much less balanced) corpus of Latin; it is, instead, simply all the Latin that can be extracted, and in its reach of twenty-one centuries (from approximately 200 BCE to 1922 CE) arguably spans the greatest historical distance of any major textual collection today. While we might hope that the size and historical reach of this collection can eventually offer insight into grand questions such as the evolution of a language over both time and space, we must contend as well with the noise inherent in a corpus that has been assembled with minimal human intervention.",

Most methods perform poorly in areas containing little or no texture and in the presence of repetitive patterns. We present a portable, cost-effective pattern projector system powered by the flash of a camera, to aid the reconstruction of such areas. No calibration is required between the camera-projector, projector-scene, or pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on various representative surfaces like stone, metal, clay, porcelain, and natural fibers, with different inherent colors/textures. A pipeline is presented to automatically generate textured, true-scale metric models, that can be used for quantitative studies or visualization. The practicability of our system is explored in the specific area of digital archiving of historically significant objects. We show results from field trips to 12th century temples at Belur and Halebidu in South India and objects from the Wintherthur museum, Delaware, USA.",

        "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of automatic reconstruction of a 3D relief object from a line drawing. Our main application is reconstruction of archaeological artifacts based on line drawings. The problem is challenging due to five reasons: the small number of orthogonal views of the object, the sparsity of the strokes, their ambiguity, their large number, and their interrelations. We partition the reconstruction problem into two subproblems. First, we reconstruct the underlying smooth base of the object from the silhouette. Assuming that the variation of bases belonging to the same class of objects is relatively small, we create the base by modifying a similar base retrieved from a database. Second, we reconstruct the relief on top of the base. Our approach can reconstruct the relief from a complex drawing that consists of many interrelated strokes. Rather than viewing the interdependencies as a problem, we show how they can be exploited to automatically generate a good initial interpretation of the line drawing. Even though our algorithm is generic, its strength is demonstrated by the reconstruction of artifacts from manual drawings taken from real archaeological reports. These drawings are highly challenging, since artists created very complex and detailed descriptions of artifacts regardless of any considerations concerning their future use for shape reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "DirectorNotation (DN) is a symbolic language intended to express the content of film (motion pictures), much as notes provide a language for the writing of music. It thus constitutes a new approach to the creative process of filmmaking. Musicians, and also choreographers, have long been able to express their creative choices using logical symbolic structures (music notation and dance notation), yet those working in the movie industry have to rely on cartoons and verbal description. Development of a successful notation becomes appropriate today because of its dependence upon the parallel development of effective notation-based software tools such as visualisation (automatic animated storyboard generation), production budget estimation, and automated rough editing of dailies. Directors maintain complete control of their creative decisions when using DN. It is an artistic language supported by technical tools for planning and analysis. The notation is not merely a graphical user interface for these tools, and the tools are never intended to make decisions for the director. This article introduces DN, argues its great cultural significance, provides market research results showing directors' interest in using it, and reports on two controlled experiments confirming its effectiveness—including its usability in a practical context and its ability to represent and communicate the necessary information.",

        "abstract": "Serious games present a promising opportunity for learning, but the genre still lacks methodologies and tools for efficient and low-cost production, particularly for teacher and domain experts. This article gives an authoring framework that aims to provide structured support, from content design to final implementation. In particular, we have abstracted a conceptual model—the SandBox Serious Game - which relies on a generalization of task-based learning theory. The model invites players to perform cognitive tasks contextually while exploring information-rich virtual environments. We consider it particularly suited for cultural heritage entertainment applications. The model defines games that are set in realistic virtual worlds enriched with embedded educational tasks, which we have implemented as minigames. This approach simplifies the authoring work, which can easily be supported by visual authoring tools for ontology-based urban 3D modeling and implementation tasks, thus allowing an approach similar to the mind-maps concept. We propose a top-down methodology for content preparation, starting from a city-level analysis down to the single points of interest and associated tasks, which are instances of simple predefined minigame/quiz typologies. We provide examples and discuss criteria for selecting task typologies according to the authors' cognitive targets. Finally, we discuss the results of a user test, which took place in a lab, aimed at verifying the acquisition of cultural heritage knowledge in a pleasant and engaging way. Games appear particularly suited for supporting the study of images, especially of iconography. Compared to reading text, a game forces the player to focus more strongly on problems, which favors knowledge acquisition and retention. Learning complex concepts requires an investigative attitude, which can be spurred by well-designed games. Good design involves usability, graphic appeal, appropriate content, and the presence of connections which a player must discover in the content. Players should be asked to pay attention to and reason about their whole game activity - including the relationships between the game content, the brief introduction, and concluding texts. More comprehensive tests are needed to better investigate the educational effectiveness—however, the first results are promising, especially in terms of user motivation and creation of new opportunities for learning about CH.",

        "abstract": "Large amounts of cultural heritage content have now been digitized and are available in digital libraries. However, these are often unstructured and difficult to navigate. Automatic techniques for identifying similar items in these collections could be used to improve navigation since it would allow items that are implicitly connected to be linked together and allow sets of similar items to be clustered. Europeana is a large digital library containing more than 20 million digital objects from a set of cultural heritage providers throughout Europe. The diverse nature of this collection means that the items do not have standard metadata to assist navigation.A range of methods for computing the similarity between pairs of texts are applied to metadata records in Europeana in order to estimate the similarity between items. Various methods for computing similarity have been proposed and can be classified into two main approaches: (1) knowledge-based, which make use of external knowledge sources and (2) corpus-based approaches, which rely on analyzing the frequency distributions of words in documents. Both techniques are evaluated against manual judgements obtained for this study and a multiple-choice test created from manually generated categories in cultural heritage collections. We find that a combination of corpus and knowledge-based approaches provide the best results in both experiments.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a novel technique for automatic archaeological sherd classification. Sherds that are found in the field usually have little to no visible textual information such as symbols, graphs, or marks on them. This makes manual classification an extremely difficult and time-consuming task for conservators and archaeologists. For a bunch of sherds found in the field, an expert identifies different classes and indicates at least one representative sherd for each class (training sample). The proposed technique uses the representative sherds in order to correctly classify the remaining sherds. For each sherd, local features based on color and texture information are extracted and are then transformed into a global vector that describes the whole sherd image, using a new bag of words technique. Finally, a feature selection algorithm is applied that locates features with high discriminative power. Extensive experiments were performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique and show very promising results.",

        "abstract": "Digital heritage archives often lack engaging user interfaces that strike a balance between providing narrative context and affording user interaction and exploration. It seems nevertheless feasible for metadata tagging and a “joined up” workflow to provide a basis for such rich interaction. After outlining relevant research from within and outside the heritage domain, we present our project, FINE (Fluid Interfaces for Narrative Exploration), an effort to develop such a system. Based on content from Wendy James' archive of anthropological research material from the Sudan/Ethiopian borderlands, the FINE project attempts to use structural and thematic metadata to drive exploratory interfaces which link video, images, audio, and text to relevant narrative units. The interfaces also benefit from the temporal and spatial variety of the collection to provide opportunities to discover contrasts and juxtaposition in the material across place and time.",

        "abstract": "Laser scanning has been widely adopted for the digital preservation and study of cultural heritage artifacts. However, surface scans alone are not sufficient for a variety of intricate objects such as the Cantonese chess pieces that were delicately carved from ivory throughout the 19th Century. These pieces incorporate a puzzle ball base, which is comprised of several balls, one inside the other. In this project we explore the use of x-ray micro-CT technology to scan the piece with a voxel separation of less than 9 μm, By using masking and editing software we generate 3D surface models of the separate parts to enable close inspection of both exterior and interior sections. Visualizing the dataset at a much larger scale enables the viewer to appreciate the fine surface details imperceivable in the original piece. Finally, 3D scaled versions are printed where the small details are also easily observed and the inner balls within the puzzle ball base move freely. The work flow demonstrated in this article has important possibilities in digital preservation, documentation, and presentation.",

        "abstract": "During the construction of an underground museum in the historic city center of Cologne, Germany, large parts of the Roman and medieval city are being excavated. The newly excavated remains as well as remains of the Roman city, which had already been excavated in 1954, exhibit structural damages. While at first deficiencies in the construction were assumed to be the cause of the damages, in 2003 a seismogenic origin was suggested. To further test this hypothesis of seismically induced slope movements and other possible causes, a multidisciplinary project was started. One step in this project is the documentation of the damages using a 3D laser scanner, followed by a quantitative damage analysis. This article presents the 3D documentation and the quantitative damage analysis of a recently excavated medieval cesspit. The 8.3m-deep cesspit was mapped during 11 campaigns using a phase-based 3D laser scanner. Due to the static conditions of the cesspit, the structure could not be excavated in its entirety. After the excavation of every 1-2m-section, restoration work had to be done to avoid a collapse of the construction. The laser scanning technique offered the possibility of working parallel to the excavation so the original conditions of each section could be documented before the restoration. The resulting models were used to identify, classify, and quantify the structural damages of the cesspit.",

        "abstract": "Museums have recognized the need for supporting visitors in fulfilling a personalized experience when visiting artwork collections, and they have started to adopt recommender systems as a way to meet this requirement. Content-based recommender systems analyze features of artworks previously rated by a visitor and build a visitor model or profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, based on those features. For example, the profile of a visitor might store the names of his or her favorite painters or painting techniques, extracted from short textual descriptions associated with artworks. The user profile is then matched against the attributes of new items in order to provide personalized suggestions. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution has changed the game for personalization from “elitist” Web 1.0, written by few and read by many, to Web content potentially generated by everyone (user-generated content - UGC). One of the forms of UGC that has drawn most attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags.In this work, we investigate the problem of deciding whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests in the context of recommending digital artworks. We present FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), a content-based recommender system which integrates UGC through social tagging in a classic content-based model, letting users express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as by annotating items with free tags. Experiments show that the accuracy of recommendations increases when tags are exploited in the recommendation process to enrich user profiles, provided that tags are not used as a surrogate for the item descriptions, but in conjunction with them. FIRSt has been developed within the CHAT project “Cultural Heritage fruition & e-learning applications of new Advanced (multimodal) Technologies”, and it is the core of a bouquet of Web services designed for personalized museum tours.",

The system is implemented in a Service Oriented Architecture perspective and it exposes its functionalities through Web services. It also provides an easy to use authoring tool, which allows cultural heritage experts to define the character's knowledge without the need for learning a scripting language. We tested the system by embedding it in a simple serious game, where the user could interact with the virtual representation of a XVI century Geneoese artist, Luca Cambiaso, in order to acquire knowledge about his life and artworks. These early lab test results showed a high level of appreciation for the usability of the system and for the user engagement. Tests also showed that the system is a good didactic tool, since players demonstrated a similar level of knowledge acquisition to that achieved by reading a text.",

        "abstract": "This study utilizes the characteristics of the Annales School, including their emphasis on total history and space and time integration, their focus on the economic world, and their use of structural analysis to develop a creation framework for a serious video game related to the cultural and life history of Taiwan's indigenous people. Game development comprised the tiers of data, logic, and presentation. During the data tier, we used taxonomy to extract the cultural components of Taiwan's Atayal tribe. During the logic tier, we employed an analysis of cultural characteristics and comparisons of historical education goals to confirm the game's framework and storytelling engine, selecting a construction management simulation game genre to present tribal life and economic operations. Finally, in the presentation tier, we converted cultural components into elements in the game's user interface.The game evaluation results showed that “Papakwaqa” (our serious game) had positive benefits for enhancing schoolchildren's learning motivation and performance regarding indigenous life and history. Our research verified that integrating the cross-disciplinary methods of anthropologists, history teachers, tribal elders, and game designers to establish instructional goals and design foci for game development and to create a cultural heritage serious game-creation framework warrants further study and effort.",

        "abstract": "This article describes a case study on MuseUs, a pervasive serious game for use in museums, running as a smartphone app. During the museum visit, players are invited to create their own exposition and are guided by the application in doing so. The aim is to provide a learning effect during a visit to a museum exhibition. Central to the MuseUs experience is that it does not necessitate a predefined path trough the museum and that it does not draw the attention away from the exposition itself. Also, the application stimulates the visitor to look at cultural heritage elements in a different way, permitting the construction of personal narratives while creating a personal exposition. Using a methodology derived from action research, we present recommendations for the design of similar applications and conclude by proposing a high-level architecture for pervasive serious games applied to cultural heritage.",

        "abstract": "Games have become an integral part of today's culture, most obviously among younger people. At the same time, learning games have proved that they can be a source of enjoyment and are, if well-made, powerful tools for communicating knowledge. For cultural heritage projects targeted to raising the awareness of the general public, the integration of interactivity and innovative storytelling techniques can be supporting elements to capture their target audiences' enthusiasm. In particular, games that deal with art history have particular flaws in integrating motivating elements. This observation led us to the development of the 3D online learning game, ThIATRO, that immerses the player an exhibition and, as a side-effect communicates knowledge of art history concepts to the player. Its playful approach not only increases motivation to learn but also raises interest in art history and cultural heritage in general. We provide an overview of the design ideas behind ThIATRO and summarize the results of evaluations conducted with a group of 14-year-old pupils in a classroom environment. The results indicate that ThIATRO changes the player's aesthetic response and allows him or her to perceive art on a deeper level.",

        "abstract": "Coin classification is one of the main aspects of numismatics. The introduction of an automated image-based coin classification system could assist numismatists in their everyday work and allow hobby numismatists to gain additional information on their coin collection by uploading images to a respective Web site. For Roman Republican coins, the inscription is one of the most significant features, and its recognition is an essential part in the successful research of an image-based coin recognition system. This article presents a novel way for the recognition of ancient Roman Republican coin legends. Traditional optical character recognition (OCR) strategies were designed for printed or handwritten texts and rely on binarization in the course of their recognition process. Since coin legends are simply embossed onto a piece of metal, they are of the same color as the background and binarization becomes error prone and prohibits the use of standard OCR. Therefore, the proposed method is based on state-of-the-art scene text recognition methods that are rooted in object recognition. Sift descriptors are computed for a dense grid of keypoints and are tested using support vector machines trained for each letter of the respective alphabet. Each descriptor receives a score for every letter, and the use of pictorial structures allows one to detect the optimal configuration for the lexicon words within an image; the word causing the lowest costs is recognized. Character and word recognition capabilities of the proposed method are evaluated individually; character recognition is benchmarked on three and word recognition on different datasets. Depending on the Sift configuration, lexicon, and dataset used, the word recognition rates range from 29% to 67%.",

It proposes a novel editable text method to represent the multidimensional tree-like information structure of the Kunqu libretto literature and a musical semantic annotation method based on numbered musical notation to accommodate the musical features of Kunqu librettos. To maintain the characteristics of the original Kunqu musical notation, it proposes a method to reconstruct Kunqu libretto on the Web based on scalable vector graphics. Some Kunqu librettos were randomly selected for experiments, and the results demonstrated that the editable text method and the musical semantic annotation method were able to fully represent the effective information of the Kunqu libretto literature and that the method to reconstruct librettos on the Web was able to reflect the writing characteristics of the musical notation in the original librettos. Finally, it discusses the primary future research directions related to digital Kunqu, including Kunqu libretto metadata research, corpus construction for the librettos and Qupai (the unique ancient Chinese tune mode), libretto music information disambiguation research, libretto image segmentation and pattern recognition, digital Kunqu roles, digital Kunqu stages, digital Kunqu costume suitcases, virtual Kunqu, digitization and restoration of Kunqu cultural relics, and Kunqu's application prospects in conventional media such as animation, anime, and movies.",

        "abstract": "We propose an application that allows a museum audience to interact with the past and to appreciate the value of antique objects through multimedia installations. Discussions in this article are based on our experiences in developing the Mao-Kung Cauldron time perception journey multimedia application. This installation was inspired by the Mao-Kung Cauldron, an ancient bronze cauldron in the collection of the National Palace Museum known for its historical significance. The question, however, lies in how to create an experience in which the audiences can interact with the past. To address this issue, the research team used the Kinect-based breath detection and deterioration/recovery simulation technologies to develop the application. This installation is the first application linked to Kinect-based breath detection and deterioration/recovery simulation technologies. The main contribution of this work is the analysis of design concepts, design decisions, and evaluations in a museum setting. We conduct a control group study to compare the outcomes between the experimental group (Mao-Kung Cauldron time perception journey multimedia application) and control group (asynchronous web-based kiosk). Both the quantitative (questionnaire survey) and qualitative methods (observation) are used to analyze the collected data. This work proposes a feasibility design to let museum audiences experience the features of cultural object by the virtual time perception journey application.",

        "abstract": "This article presents the process of reconstructing three facade designs for the east wing of the Louvre using procedural modeling. The first proposal reconstructed is Louis Le Vau's 1662 scheme, the second is Gian Lorenzo Bernini's first design, and the third is the 1668 petit conseil design that still stands today. The results show how such reconstructions may aid both a general and an expert understanding of the three designs. It is proposed that by formalizing the facade description into a shape grammar with procedural modeling, a systematized approach to a stylistic analysis is possible. It is also asserted that such an analysis is still best understood within the historical context of what is known about the contemporary design intentions of the building creators and commissioners.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the similarities, differences, and relationships between cultural heritage artifacts is critical for determining their significance and their provenance. It also provides valuable information for ensuring the long-term preservation of cultural heritage artifacts. Consequently, as more museums develop online three-dimensional (3D) collections, curators and scholars are demanding online tools that enable them to document and interpret variances and similarities between related 3D digital objects. This article describes a system that was developed to enable museum curators and/or scholars to document relationships between multiple 3D digital representations of museum objects using web-based annotation tools. The 3D Semantic Association (3DSA) system enables users to annotate relationships between multiple whole objects, parts of objects, or features on objects (surface features or volumetric segments). The annotations are stored on a server in an interoperable format that can be shared, discovered, browsed, and retrieved through a web browser interface. This approach not only improves scholars’ capabilities to undertake cultural heritage research but also enables researchers to document, share, discuss, and compare alternative hypotheses about the relationships between artifacts.",

This paper describes the initial steps of an attempt to design games for different places of cultural heritage and consists of three parts. In the first part, the descriptive model to be used as a classification method for games of different characteristics for cultural heritage sites is presented. In the second part, the model is used for the creation of different cultural heritage games. Finally, the third part presents a detailed case study of one of the developed games, showing the implementation and user testing processes as well as its efficiency in terms of education and visit motivation.",

However, experimental archaeology has, until now, confined itself to rigid, empirical, and quantitative questions. This article applies principles of experimental archaeology and serious gaming tools in the reconstructions of a British Iron Age round house. This article explains a number of experiments conducted to look for quantitative differences in movement in virtual versus material environments, using both “virtual” studio reconstruction as well as material reconstruction. The data from these experiments was then analysed to look for differences in movement that could be attributed to artefacts and/or environments. This article also explains the structure of the experiments, how the data was generated, what theories may make sense of the data, what conclusions have been drawn, and how serious gaming tools can support the creation of new experimental heritage environments.",

The strong spatial dependence of this data suggests that the information should be linked to a 3D model of the artifact. This article presents a 3D information system that has been designed to manage cultural heritage information. The system allows information layers to be associated with the surface of the artifact, following an approach similar to that used in geographical information systems. This permits relationships between the different elements to be ascertained, and allows both specialists and the layperson to more easily understand the information. We describe here the structure and functionality of the system.",

        "abstract": "Laser range scanning is commonly used in cultural heritage to create digital models of real-world artefacts. A large scanning campaign can produce billions of point samples—too many to be manipulated in memory on most computers. It is thus necessary to spatially partition the data so that it can be processed in bins or slices. We introduce a novel compression mechanism that exploits spatial coherence in the data to allow the bins to be computed with only 1.01 bytes of I/O traffic for each byte of input, compared to 2 or more for previous schemes. Additionally, the bins are loaded from the original files for processing rather than from a sorted copy, thus minimizing disk space requirements. We demonstrate that our method yields performance improvements in a typical point-processing task, while also using little memory and guaranteeing an upper bound on the number of samples held in-core.",

This platform, called LOCUS IMAGINIS, provides access to cultural information about monuments by collecting personal snapshots taken by visitors. In particular, the platform enables to perform two actions. First, pictures are added into the database: visitors manually align images to the digital model of the monument and than, by means of automatic procedures, images are enriched with 2D semantic annotations that are projected from the 3D model. Second, the collection of semantically-enriched data can be queried: when visitors select 2D images of the database, these are oriented in the 3D scene and superimposed onto the 3D-model. In this way, this tool provides access to textual and graphic information describing the photographed site (semantic, spatial, temporal features, etc.). Moreover, visitors can interact both with images and the 3D-model to highlight building parts by color. Accessible onsite and online, this tool can create awareness about conservation and is adapted to all kinds of audience: Students involved in educational workshops, visitors needing to extend their visit, and documentalists interested in the consultation of the iconographic corpus.",

        "abstract": "Digital gaming and digital technologies have their own unique cultural history while at the same time, the cultural heritage of digital technology is emerging. Digital technology has been understood as merely an apparatus that can be utilized for transferring nondigital historical content to novel digital products. These products, including types such as multimedia shows, games, Web sites, and online course environments, are targeted at juvenile audiences, who are typically considered to be the primary users of such new media forms. For decades, the changes and new continuities in both mediated content and the technology of mediation were mostly hidden in the shadow of educational goal-attainment. This article draws inspiration from ideas on media archaeology and the cultures of history. In this article we suggest an approach of internal and external cultural heritage of games cultures. We introduce a four-fold table regarding the relationship between cultural heritage (or history) and digital technology. The four-fold table consists of the dimension of a researcher's comprehensive/applied goal-attainment and the dimension of the internality/externality of history and cultural heritage in regard to the digital game cultural context. Within these cultures, there are several alternative ways of discussing the relationship between history, cultural heritage, and digital technology, separate from the traditional edutainment perspective. The dimensions are illustrated with practical examples, including a typologization of historiographical computer games, retrogaming, and educational workshops on game classics.",

        "abstract": "Museums and Cultural Heritage institutions have a growing interest in presenting their collections to a broader community via the Internet. The photo-realistic presentation of interactively inspectable virtual surrogates is one of the most challenging problems in this field. For this purpose, we seek to employ not only a 3D geometry but also a powerful material representation capable of reproducing the full visual appeal of an object. In this article, we propose a WebGL-based presentation framework in which reflectance information is represented via Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). Our approach works out-of-the-box in modern Web browsers and allows for the progressive transmission and interactive rendering of digitized artifacts consisting of 3D geometry and reflectance information. We handle the huge amount of data needed for this representation by employing a novel progressive streaming approach for BTFs, which allows for the smooth interactive inspection of a steadily improving version during the download. We demonstrate an interesting use-case of this technique at a cross section of Cultural Heritage, medical education, and research and provide an evaluation of the capabilities of our framework in the scope of BTF compression and transmission.",

However, in digital cultural heritage research, intangible cultural heritage has been relatively less studied, and the focus has been placed on creating tools and applications for professionals rather than for the general public. In this paper, we present our research effort on creating an interactive system for conveying traditional Chinese culture through natural language conversation. We propose a systematic method for the domain experts to construct, with minimal effort, the knowledge base from a set of unstructured philosophy texts, and we design an algorithm to build a conversational agent emulating the conversation ability of a famous Chinese philosopher. We also report two evaluation studies on the prototype we developed, showing encouraging results on the feasibility and benefits of our approach. By automating part of the answer-finding task using natural language processing and information retrieval technology, the system is able to find answers dynamically, without the need to manually author large amounts of question and answer pairs. Our proposed method could potentially be used to create other conversational agents for educating and promoting cultural values to the general public in a natural and appealing way.",

        "abstract": "We describe a system that automatically notates a comparative visualization of multiple recorded performances of the same musical work. Written musical scores have transmitted basic performance information to musicians over the ages; however, these scores only provide skeletal instructions that must be fleshed out in performance, as musical notation describes phrasing, articulation, dynamics, accentuation, and other ornamentations in generalized and ambiguous forms. Consequently, musical performances derived from the same notation can vary widely from each other in the same manner that a written text may be spoken with intense emotion or in flat monotone. Prior to the advent of recording technology, musical performances were ephemeral, only occurring once, never to be heard again in exactly the same rendition. As a result, musical interpretations were informed only by live listening. Now, with more than a century of recorded performance practice, musicians can delve deeper into the history of their aural art to gain inspiration and insight from sources that would otherwise have been inaccessible. Performers have become interested in giving performances inspired by recordings of the past, which often obey a musical common sense alien to the standards of modern practice, and it is useful for historically informed performers to describe, analyze, emulate, and internalize the performance styles of the past through the detailed study of recordings. Although much can be learned by listening, a visual interface may reveal potentially inaudible details of a recording. Because performers interact daily with traditional musical notation—a sophisticated, if ambiguous, multidimensional visualization of musical information—one approach to the design of such an interface leverages performers' existing knowledge by reducing the gap between data visualization and traditional musical notation as much as possible. Using Abjad, a Python-based tool for musical composition, the symbols of conventional staff notation are augmented to illustrate the intensity and temporal proximity of performed musical events graphically, thus facilitating the comparison of individual performances and the study of changes in performance aesthetics over time.",

        "abstract": "In this article, a method of merging point clouds using the modified Harris corner detection algorithm for extracting interest points of textured 3D point clouds is proposed. A new descriptor characterizing point features for identifying corresponding points in datasets is presented. The merging process is based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which enables calculation of the geometric transformation between point clouds based on a set of interest points that includes incorrect samples, called outliers. The proposed processing path is designed to integrate many directional measurements, which are acquired with a 3D scanner and are represented as unsorted point clouds (x, y, z) with color information (R, G, B). Exemplary measurements shown in this article represent sections of ceiling in the King's Chinese Cabinet of the Museum of King Jan III's Palace at Wilanow in Warsaw, Poland, as well as some more complex objects. Experimental verification confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in integrating directional measurements of objects with detailed texture, particularly if they have no unique geometric features.",

        "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of automatic reconstruction of ancient artifacts from archaeological fragments. The technique described here focuses on pairwise matching of flat fragments (typically fresco fragments), and it is intended to be the core of a larger system for artifact reconstruction. Global registration techniques are challenging due to the combinatory explosion that happens in the solution space: the goal is to find the best alignment among all possible ones without an initialization. This fact defines the duality between performance and correction that we face in this work. The proposed technique defines a cost function to evaluate the quality of an alignment based on a discrete sampling of the fragments that ensures data alignment. Starting from an exhaustive search strategy, the technique progressively incorporates new features that lead to a hierarchical search strategy. Convergence and correction of the resulting technique are ensured using an optimistic cost function. Internal search calculations are optimized so the only operations performed are additions, subtractions, and comparisons over aligned data. All heavy geometric operations are carried out by the GPU on a preprocessing stage that only happens once per fragment.",

        "abstract": "Art conservators now have access to a wide variety of digital imaging techniques to assist in examining and documenting physical works of art. Commonly used techniques include hyperspectral imaging, 3D scanning, and medical computed tomography imaging. However, viewing most of this digital image data frequently requires both specialized software, which is often associated with a particular type of acquisition device, and professional knowledge of and experience with each type of data. In addition, many of these software packages are focused on particular applications (such as medicine or remote sensing) and do not permit users to access and fully exploit all the information contained in the data. In this paper, we address two practical barriers to using high-tech digital data in art conservation. First, users must deal with a wide variety of interfaces specialized for applications besides conservation. We provide an open-source software tool with a single intuitive interface consistent with conservators' needs that handles various types of 2D and 3D image data and preserves user-generated metadata and annotations. Second, previous software has largely allowed visualizing a single type or only a few types of data. The software we present is designed and structured to accommodate multiple types of digital imaging data, including as yet unspecified or unimplemented formats, in an integrated environment. This allows conservators to access different forms of information and to view a variety of image types simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "This research has been conducted in the context of the ArtiMuse project that aims at the modeling and renewal of rare gestural knowledge and skills involved in the traditional craftsmanship and more precisely in the art of wheel-throwing pottery. These knowledge and skills constitute intangible cultural heritage and refer to the fruit of diverse expertise founded and propagated over the centuries thanks to the ingeniousness of the gesture and the creativity of the human spirit. Nowadays, this expertise is very often threatened with disappearance because of the difficulty to resist globalization and the fact that most of those “expertise holders” are not easily accessible due to geographical or other constraints. In this article, a methodological framework for capturing and modeling gestural knowledge and skills in wheel-throwing pottery is proposed. It is based on capturing gestures using wireless inertial sensors and statistical modeling. In particular, we used a system that allows for online alignment of gestures using a modified Hidden Markov Model. This methodology is implemented into a human--computer interface, which permits both the modeling and recognition of expert technical gestures. This system could be used to assist in the learning of these gestures by giving continuous feedback in real time by measuring the difference between expert and learner gestures. The system has been tested and evaluated on different potters with rare expertise, which is strongly related to their local identity.",

        "abstract": "Starting from our experience in this domain, we discuss some fundamental concepts about the potentialities of the virtual reconstructions of cultural sites inside museums, with a specific focus on the communication needs, the design, the combination of media, the interaction interfaces, and the embodiment. We conceive a virtual reconstruction as a digital ecosystem, whose main peculiarities are (1) 3D reconstruction, (2) inclusivity, and (3) interactivity. A virtual reconstruction, in a wide sense, should integrate different levels of visualization, both realistic and symbolic; 3D models; metadata; storytelling; behaviors; and tools of visualization and interaction, in order to “reconstruct” and communicate a cultural context, an ecosystem where all the information is integrated. Despite the great advancements of the last years in the digitization process, computer graphics techniques, and archiving strategies, a basic limit of most of virtual museums is that they do not fire up the attention and the involvement of the public: they lack stimulating activities for visitors, narratives metaphors, and emotional impact. The interaction interfaces are not always simple to understand and to control in a few minutes, and they can generate a sense of frustration that causes users to abandon the application after a short and superficial approach. No gap should exist between knowledge and communication. But how can we translate the complexity of the knowledge in appealing to users and into simple applications that fit with the public's need? This article focuses on some communication rules and criteria that are often considered of minor importance by the researchers working in the field of digital cultural heritage but that are really essential to cultural transmission, especially inside museums. We believe that a stronger collaboration between research institutions and museums and among different disciplines would be recommended. Given this premise, we present the Etruscanning EU project, developed in 2011--2013, focused on the virtual reconstruction of two important Etruscan tombs of the Orientalizing period: the Regolini-Galassi tomb in Cerveteri and the tomb n.5 of Monte Michele in Veii.",

        "abstract": "Over the past three decades, the introduction of digital technologies in the field of architectural documentation has profoundly changed tools and acquisition techniques. Most of the developments concern metrical and colorimetric characteristics of the objects studied. These developments, surrounding the practice of architectural survey, tend to respond primarily to the requirements of completeness. In this context, it seems necessary to assess the impact of these instruments on the cognitive value of architectural representation. With a strong technological presence, the study of the built heritage is facing a problem of “information overload.” Indeed, this strong technological presence fails to strengthen representation in its role as a vehicle of knowledge. Confronted with the intelligibility deficit, this article proposes an original approach for reading morphological features of an artifact by using a bottom-up approach: the meaning of elements (i.e., their semantic layouts) come from a statistical analysis of the major shape discontinuities of a collection of instances. The idea is to rely on data accumulation to render apparent high-level semantic structures from the comparative analysis of common low-level geometric features. The principles introduced are illustrated by the study of 31 columns of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa. To summarize, the first objective is to understand how digital technologies can help us in the analysis of artistic and technical production of Romanesque columns. The second objective is to automatically identify the common semantic articulations of the entire collection to build a reference model for the future assessment of each artifact.",

        "abstract": "The Dream of the Rood is one of the earliest Christian poems in Old English and an example of the genre of dream poetry. While a complete text can be found in the 10th-century “Vercelli Book,” the poem is considerably older, and its oldest occurrence is carved (in runes) on the 7- to 8th-century Ruthwell Stone Cross. In this article, we present the work done in the framework of the “Visionary Cross” project, starting from the digitization of the Ruthwell Cross to the creation of a web-based digital edition of The Dream of the Rood, as it is carved on the Cross. The 3D data has been collected and processed with the explicit aim of creating a multimedia framework able to present the highly detailed digital model acquired with 3D scanning technology, together with the transcription and translation of the runes that can be found on its surface. The textual and spatial information are linked through a system of bidirectional links called Spots, which allow the users to navigate freely over the multimedia content, keeping the 3D and textual data synchronized. The present work discusses the different issues that arose during the work, from digitization and processing to the design of a tool for the integration of three-dimensional content in the context of the presentation on the web platform of heterogeneous multimedia data. We end with the difficulties involved in the creation of an XML encoding that could account for the necessities of the visualization system but remain within the scholarly encoding standards of the relevant disciplinary community.",

        "abstract": "We propose an approach for improving the digitization of shape and color of 3D artworks in a cluttered environment using 3D laser scanning and flash photography. To separate clutter from acquired material, semiautomated methods are employed to generate masks used to segment the range maps and the color photographs. This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont’e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports. Color and shape were acquired at a resolution of 0.25mm, which resulted in more than 6,200 range maps (about 1.3G valid samples) and 3,817 photographs.",

        "abstract": "Effective documentation and display of ancient objects is an essential task in the field of cultural heritage conservation. Digitization plays an important role in the process of creating, preserving, and accessing objects in digital space. Up to the present day, industrial scanners are used for this task, which focus mainly on the detailed reconstruction of the object’s geometry only. However, particularly important for a faithful digital presentation of the object is the appearance information—that is, a description of the used materials and how they interact with incident light. Using the world’s first full-spherical scanner, we propose a user-friendly reconstruction process that is specifically tailored to the needs of digitizing and representing cultural heritage artifacts. More precisely, our hardware specifically addresses the problem that invaluable or fragile artifacts may not be turned over during acquisition. Nevertheless, we can digitize the object completely, including its bottom. Further, by integrating appearance information into our digitization, we achieve a far more faithful digital replica with a quality comparable to a real picture of the object. But in contrast to a static picture, our representation allows one to interactively change the viewing and lighting directions freely. In addition, the results are very memory efficient, consuming only several megabytes per scanned object. In cooperation with museums and a private collector, we digitized several cultural heritage artifacts to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed process.",

The study and browsing of such digital libraries is invaluable for scholars in the Cultural Heritage field but requires automatic tools for analyzing and indexing these datasets. We present two completely automatic methods requiring no human intervention: text height estimation and text line extraction. Our proposed methods have been evaluated on a huge heterogeneous corpus of illuminated medieval manuscripts of different writing styles and with various problematic attributes, such as holes, spots, ink bleed-through, ornamentation, background noise, and overlapping text lines. Our experimental results demonstrate that these two new methods are efficient and reliable, even when applied to very noisy and damaged old handwritten manuscripts.",

        "abstract": "As scanning technologies improve new approaches to digitizing cultural heritage artefacts emerge. The use of micro--computed tomography (micro-CT) presents an interesting approach as it is capable of high-resolution scans of not just the surface of the artifact but also the intricate internal structures and volumes leading to more complete digitization than is possible with traditional surface laser scanning techniques. In this work, we investigate the potential to digitize heritage artifacts using micro-CT and focus on the methods of interacting with the datasets to create digital restorations of broken and incomplete pieces before printing physical replicas using 3D printing technology. We visualize the virtual models with clear identification of the new portions added by a digital artist with reference to existing pieces and archives.",

The installation was built for the Maritime Museum in Kotka, Finland, and is part of the preservation efforts of the wreck, which still remains underwater. In addition to the cultural heritage aspect, the project was an experiment in holistic user-centered design, where several design methods, such as scenarios, role playing and informance, storyboards, and prototyping, were employed throughout the process in order to envision the final product as well as assess their utility in the scope of immersive installations. The approach we have taken and documented here can be used as a starting point for similar projects where archaeological sites are reconstructed virtually and presented, for example, in a museum setting.",

        "abstract": "Studying Greek and Latin cultural heritage has always been considered essential to the understanding of important aspects of the roots of current European societies. However, only a small fraction of the total production of texts from ancient Greece and Rome has survived up to the present, leaving many gaps in the historiographic records. Epigraphy, which is the study of inscriptions (epigraphs), helps to fill these gaps. In particular, the goal of epigraphy is to clarify the meanings of epigraphs; to classify their uses according to their dating and cultural contexts; and to study aspects of the writing, the writers, and their “consumers.” Although several research projects have recently been promoted for digitally storing and retrieving data and metadata about epigraphs, there has actually been no attempt to apply data mining technologies to discover previously unknown cultural aspects. In this context, we propose to exploit the temporal dimension associated with epigraphs (dating) by applying a data mining method for novelty detection. The main goal is to discover relational novelty patterns—that is, patterns expressed as logical clauses describing significant variations (in frequency) over the different epochs, in terms of relevant features such as language, writing style, and material. As a case study, we considered the set of Inscriptiones Christianae Vrbis Romae stored in Epigraphic Database Bari, an epigraphic repository. Some patterns discovered by the data mining method were easily deciphered by experts since they captured relevant cultural changes, whereas others disclosed unexpected variations, which might be used to formulate new questions, thus expanding the research opportunities in the field of epigraphy.",

        "abstract": "Despite their temporal proximity, the technologies of the early computers are far from us. Yet, they are part of the history of science and technology, and they deserve to be studied and popularized. Being machines made to run software programs, they should be exhibited running. Unfortunately, old machines still in working condition are extremely rare. Restoring or rebuilding an old computer is a hard, expensive task: the original components are rare, and the technology is forgotten and sometimes lost. The research needed to re-understand those computers has to adopt experimental archaeology methods: rebuilding old hardware/software requires proceeding by hypotheses and experiments.However, a rebuilt or restored computer is a unique exemplar and a precious specimen: it is not suitable to let people interact with it. A more flexible solution is to use software simulations. First of all, simulation is a valuable tool to carry out the experiments needed to study past technology. Second, the simulators are virtual replicas that let people fully understand the old machines by interacting with them without jeopardizing those precious relics of the past.This article presents the virtual rebuilding of the first computer made in Italy: the Macchina Ridotta (MR) of the University of Pisa. The MR was dismantled after few months of intensive usage to cannibalize the materials for a second computer. As a consequence, the MR disappeared from later chronicles and for many years was ignored by historians. When we attempted to reconstruct the MR history, we found that the survived documentation was far from complete. Simulation proved to be the key tool to support the experimental approach adopted for understanding the MR technology, rebuilding it, and assessing its achievements. The MR simulator is now used at the Museum of Computing Machinery of Pisa as a mean to truly experience a working session on the MR—a typical computer from the 1950s. The exhibit and the workshops, by exploiting the accurately reproduced characteristics of the MR, address popularization of computer science from several perspectives: from technological mechanisms to scientific foundations, passing through the representation of computers in popular culture.",

        "abstract": "This article is devoted to a novel application of the micro-3D modeling based on shape from focus. A 3D portable digital microscope prototype has been used for the first time in order to analyze gold punchwork on medieval panel paintings. In general, the 3D domain provides a more flexible and complete characterization of these decorative elements than traditional photographic documentation. Low-magnification 3D digital microscopy is well suited for analyzing morphologies, depths, and profiles of different punch marks. Here, we used these parameters for interpreting the punching process and recognizing sliding and bouncing effects. The 3D reconstruction of the surface engraved also allowed identifying types of anomalies that could be useful as possible authentication markers. The advantages of the present approach with respect to the photographic documentation are of general valence and can be exploited in order to document, parameterize, and interpret a variety of engraving works on panel paintings and metal artifacts.",

        "abstract": "This article deals with storage and transportation of fragile heritage objets. The main goal is to create an ad hoc packaging software solution by combining the use of 3D scanning and 3D milling technologies. Traditionally, packaging for this kind of object is made manually, creating custom supports and boxes adapted to the specific needs and particularities of each case. This process is time consuming and fully depends on the conservator’s skills. On the other hand, the proposed solution provides a faster execution and a standard solution adapted to every object. The process starts with the acquisition of 3D digital models of the original artifacts and uses an interactive GPU-accelerated algorithm to assist the conservator in the construction of the package. The final result is a CNC program that is sent to a low-cost milling machine to produce the housing for the selected artifact. Unlike 3D printers, milling machines allow working with lots of different materials, which is a key aspect for this kind of package: chemical stability and shock absorption are mandatory. Given that during the design process original artifacts are only manipulated in the acquisition stage, risks of damaging them are also reduced. Since the whole process is considered in the same application, intermediate calculations are performed considering manufacturing and user-defined restrictions. This way, together with a GPU implementation, achieved results are very fast, providing a real-time application with visual feedback.",

It has emerged as a result of new interest in the experimental archaeology and the technological development of computer graphic tools. Therefore, this article presents a project aimed at the scientific reconstruction of the original polychromy and the realistic rendering of an ancient sarcophagus, obtained with the use of some open source tools. In particular, starting from the accurate study of a polychrome Roman sarcophagus (National Roman Museum in Rome, inv. no. 125891), we show how the MeshLab tool was used to support the polychrome reconstruction stage and how Blender (or, rather, a combination of MeshLab and Blender) was used to achieve a more sophisticated visual presentation of the current and reconstruction ancient colour. A central role has been given to the rendering of different and overlapped layers of paint.",

        "abstract": "Location-based systems currently represent a suitable solution to enhance cultural experiences inside museums, as they can satisfy visitors’ needs through the provision of contextualized contents and services. In this framework, a promising approach to captivate the attention of teenagers—a hard to please target audience—is represented by mobile serious games, such as playful activities aiming to primarily fulfil educational purposes. The use of a mobile digital tool during the visit definitely discloses new opportunities for contextual learning scenarios; however, so far, only a few studies have analysed the impact of different communication approaches on visitors’ degree of exploration and acquisition of knowledge. This work aims to enrich this field of research, presenting the conceptual framework; the design principles; and the evaluation results of “Gossip at palace,” a location-based mobile game integrating a storytelling approach. The game was developed for an Italian historical residence to communicate its 18th-century history to teenagers, capitalizing on narrative and game mechanics to foster young visitors’ motivations to explore the museum and facilitate their meaning-making process. Following a mixed-methods perspective, the article firstly describes to what extent the components of the application were appreciated by teenagers as well as by other visitor segments. Secondly, it provides an insight on the effectiveness of the game in facilitating the acquisition of historical knowledge by participants, enriched by considerations on the methods to be adopted when evaluating mobile learning in informal educational settings. Thirdly, players’ degree of use of the digital game throughout the visit is compared to analogous patterns registered for people using a multimedia mobile guide in the same venue. On the one hand, the study pointed out that the game facilitated a wider exploration of the museum; on the other, it highlighted that players mainly gained a superficial knowledge of the proposed contents.",

        "abstract": "The literature on information retrieval shows the importance of information reliability as a key criterion for relevance judgment. However, information reliability evaluation is discussed in many disciplines such as history, Arabic storytelling, and computer science. Although these disciplines share common principles, they differ in many aspects, which are studied in this article. However, we mainly focus on two disciplines. On the one hand, Arabic storytelling stands by rigid rules for transmitting information and inspecting sources and contents. On the other hand, the characteristics of the Web as a collaborative, open and vast area for information sharing has caused changes in our evaluation of information. This article studies related works to enumerate the main principles and steps that constitute guidelines for automatic information reliability evaluation. Finally, these guidelines are applied to Arabic storytelling, and experimental results are presented.",

        "abstract": "The microscopic description of ancient pottery is widely used for the fabric definition, classification and provenance assessment. In most cases, however, the description is qualitative. An improvement of the study of archaeological pottery needs a more objective approach with quantitative analysis. In classical scientific literature, the structural features and mineralogical composition of pottery are carried out on thin sections by means of transmitted polarized light microscope. The determination were obtained through observations with and without cross polarizator (nicols). The quantitative measurements are normally achieved with tedious and time consuming table with point counter. In this article the attention has been focused on the automatic identification of structural and textural components of the potteries through optical microscopy. Image analysis techniques have been then used to automatically classify the image components. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach: petrographic data collection becomes faster with respect to the traditional method providing also quantitative information useful for fabric recognition.",

        "abstract": "Visitor studies explore human experiences within museums, cultural heritage sites, and other informal learning settings to inform decisions. Smartphones offer novel opportunities for extending the depth and breadth of visitor studies while considerably reducing their cost and their demands on specialist human resources. By enabling the collection of significantly higher volumes of data, they also make possible the application of advanced machine-learning and visualization techniques, potentially leading to the discovery of new patterns and behaviors that cannot be captured by simple descriptive statistics. In this article, we present a principled approach to the use of smartphones for visitor studies, in particular proposing a structured methodology and associated methods that enable its effective use in this context. We discuss specific methodological considerations that have to be addressed for effective data collection, preprocessing, and analysis and identify the limitations in the applicability of these tools using family visits to the London Zoo as a case study. We conclude with a discussion of the wider opportunities afforded by the introduction of smartphones and related technologies and outline the steps toward establishing them as a standard tool for visitor studies.",

        "abstract": "Andean textiles are products of one of the richest, oldest and continuous weaving traditions in the world. Understanding the knowledge and practice of textile production as a form of cultural heritage is particularly relevant in the Andean context due to erosion of clothing traditions, reuse of traditional textiles on commodities targeted at the tourism market, and loss of knowledge embedded in textile production. “Weaving Communities of Practice” was a pilot project that aimed to create a knowledge base of Andean weaving designed to contribute to curatorial practice and heritage policy. The research team gathered data on the chain of activities, instruments, resources, peoples, places and knowledge involved in the production of textiles, relating to over 700 textile samples. A major part of the project has been the modelling and representation of the knowledge of domain experts and information about the textile objects themselves in the form of an OWL ontology, and the development of a suite of search facilities to be supported by the ontology. This paper describes the research challenges faced in developing the ontology and search facilities, the methodology adopted, the design and implementation of the system, and the design and outcomes of a user evaluation of the system undertaken with a group of domain experts.",

The team of the University of Cyprus investigating the 4th-century BC Mazotos shipwreck are unable to interact easily and intuitively with the recorded data, a fact that impedes visualization and reconstruction and subsequently delays the evaluation of their hypotheses. An immersive 3D visualization application that utilizes a VR CAVE was developed, with the intent to enable researchers to mine the wealth of information this ancient shipwreck has to offer. Through the implementation and evaluation of the proposed application, this research seeks to investigate whether such an environment can aid the interpretation and analysis process and ultimately serve as an additional scientific tool for underwater archaeology.",

The proposed application is set at a UNESCO World Heritage site in Japan, and is based on a novel framework that supports the photorealistic superimposition of virtual objects onto virtualized real scenes. The proposed framework utilizes Image-Based Rendering (IBR), which enables users to freely change their viewpoint in a real-world virtualization constructed using precaptured images. This framework combines the offline rendering of virtual objects and IBR to take advantage of the higher quality of offline rendering without the additional computational cost of online processing; that is, it incurs only the cost of online lightweight IBR, which is simplified through the pregeneration of structured viewpoints (e.g., at grid points).",

The aim of this article is to present some consideration on factors that could facilitate cultural learning in virtual heritage environment. Cultural learning in the context of this study refers to the acquisition of knowledge that encourages cultural awareness and appreciation. In this study, we explore virtual heritage environment design features, and cultural information characteristics and presentation formats that are important to facilitate cultural learning, from the casual user's perspective. We conducted experiments that required users to explore virtual heritage environments (focusing on architectural heritage) from selected heritage-related websites, followed by interview sessions. Four contributing factors were identified: information design, information presentation, navigation mechanism, and environment setting. The results suggest the need to reduce users’ cognitive load when exploring virtual heritage environments while simultaneously presenting information that adds value to their understanding. The results also suggest that the inclusion of cultural information in virtual heritage environments is essential for cultural learning to take place.",

        "abstract": "Today’s information society needs efficient and economic solutions for the digital restoration of the photographic heritage. Different methods have been adopted up to now for the automatic detection of dust and scratches; each method has pros and cons, and a limited field of effectiveness. The use of infrared radiation and the spatiotemporal image analysis are among the most effective methods, although they have their limits. The infrared radiation only works for dye-based material, while the spatiotemporal image analysis is not applicable for still images and is limited due to motion in the scene. The present work defines in detail a set of methods for optical dust and scratches detection applicable on any type of transparent photographic material (silver-based as well as dye-based material, still images as well as moving images). The term “optical” refers to the fact that the considered methods seek physical evidence of the presence of foreign bodies or irregularities on the film; this allows avoiding the typical digital artifacts produced by “nonoptical” methods, for which certain elements of the scenes are erroneously obliterated because they resemble dust grains or scratches. “PDD” (Polarized Dark-field Detection) detects the flaws using an image acquired in a polarized dark-field setup; “DCD” (Dual Collimation Detection) takes advantage of the Callier effect to locate the flaws; “n-MDD” (Multiple Direction Detection) entails the acquisition of n images in dark-field setups with different directions of illumination, and the extraction of the differences between the images through multivariate analysis. A numerical evaluation of the performances of the MDD method with an eightfold acquisition (8-MDD) is carried out by comparing its flaw detection with the flaw detection provided by commercial software based on spatiotemporal image analysis.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of the statistical description of 3D surfaces with the purpose of automatic classification and retrieval of archaeological potsherds. These are particularly interesting problems in archaeology, as pottery comprises a great volume of findings in archaeological excavations. Indeed, the analysis of potsherds brings relevant cues for understanding the culture of ancient groups. In particular, we develop a new local shape descriptor for 3D surfaces, called the histogram of spherical orientations (HoSO), which we use in combination with a bag-of-words approach to compute visual similarity between 3D surfaces. Given a point of interest on a 3D surface, its local shape descriptor (HoSO) captures the distribution of the spherical orientations of its neighboring points. In turn, those spherical orientations are computed with respect to the point of interest itself, both in the azimuth and the zenith axis. The proposed HoSO is invariant to scale transformations and highly robust to rotation and noise. In addition, it is efficient, as it only exploits the information of the position of the 3D points and disregards other types of information like faces or normals. We performed experiments on a set of 3D surfaces representing potsherds from the Teotihuacan civilization and further validations on a set of 3D models of generic objects. Our results show that our methodology is effective for describing 3D models and that it improves classification performance with respect to previous local descriptors.",

In fact, the preservation of archaeological objects has always been an issue of concern for the research community. On the one hand, the fragility of the objects limits their study. On the other hand, such objects are housed in museums, libraries, and institutions worldwide, locations that significantly limit their accessibility. Different survey methods have been carried out in these attempts to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Among them, the MicMac open source software was used in this work to survey and process the dense correlation of the hieroglyphics inscriptions engraved on archaeological stones. Relatively standard workflows have led to depth maps, which can be represented either as 3D point clouds or shaded relief images. This article shows the application of this method in two epigraphic survey case studies.",

        "abstract": "An author's literary style is influenced by the cultural time period in which the author lives. The author's ideas, and the words chosen to express them, can help identify the cultural time period that most influenced the author.Ideas are expressed in language through sequences of words called n-grams. Over the past several years, Google has been engaged in digitizing millions of books. As part of this endeavor, Google has created a database of n-grams extracted from these digitized books and has made the database available to researchers online. This is the first time ever that such an extensive repository of cultural data has been made available.This study develops and tests an original method for utilizing Google's database to identify the cultural time period that most influenced the author of a published work. Several undisputed literary works are examined, from which sets of n-grams are extracted and compared against the Google database. The frequency and distribution of n-gram matches allow us to determine the cultural time period that most influenced the author. The method is also tested against several literary works having uncertain or disputed authorship and period of composition.The results suggest that the method developed provides a reasonable approximation of the time period of greatest cultural influence for each book. Unexpectedly, the results tend to support conclusions reached by another researcher with regard to prior literary influences on the Ern Malley Poems. In addition, they lend support to early 19th-century origins for authorship of Book of Mormon",

        "abstract": "Shape representations are critical for visual analysis of cultural heritage materials. This article studies two types of shape representations in a bag-of-words-based pipeline to recognize Maya glyphs. The first is a knowledge-driven Histogram of Orientation Shape Context (HOOSC) representation, and the second is a data-driven representation obtained by applying an unsupervised Sparse Autoencoder (SA). In addition to the glyph data, the generalization ability of the descriptors is investigated on a larger-scale sketch dataset. The contributions of this article are four-fold: (1) the evaluation of the performance of a data-driven auto-encoder approach for shape representation; (2) a comparative study of hand-designed HOOSC and data-driven SA; (3) an experimental protocol to assess the effect of the different parameters of both representations; and (4) bridging humanities and computer vision/machine learning for Maya studies, specifically for visual analysis of glyphs. From our experiments, the data-driven representation performs overall in par with the hand-designed representation for similar locality sizes on which the descriptor is computed. We also observe that a larger number of hidden units, the use of average pooling, and a larger training data size in the SA representation all improved the descriptor performance. Additionally, the characteristics of the data and stroke size play an important role in the learned representation.",

        "abstract": "We describe a common problem in the curation and analysis of archaeological materials: restoring the orientation and dimensions of damaged objects. Our focus is a common architectural type in Mediterranean sites, the Doric column drum, which we investigate at one of the earliest Doric temples in the Greek world, the Hera temple at Olympia. The 3D modeling and analysis of this building by the Digital Architecture Project since 2013 has revealed new insights into the construction history of its stone colonnades. This paper concerns the analysis of the 3D models of the in situ material, using the almost 100 fallen drums and capitals to reconstruct the colonnade digitally. In order to accomplish this, we propose two novel methods for training the machine to estimate the dimensions of a fragmentary column drum. One approach is a modification of ICP, where the fragment is compared to an ideal model of an intact drum, which is resized iteratively until concluding with a satisfactory fit. Another approach recasts the scan data into polar coordinates and uses RANSAC to identify the exterior profiles of the piece and remove points likely to belong to damaged areas. The filtered points are then examined by the algorithm to estimate the radii and taper of the drum. Besides saving a great deal of time in the field, these methods are also accurate to within 0.2% of the total radius for well-preserved material, and 1% for even the most fragmentary drums at Olympia. These data have allowed the digital reconstruction of 80% of the displaced drums and all of the capitals from the temple. Our algorithms can be used to measure any fluted column drums, and we discuss the potential value of our approach for other categories of archaeological artifacts.",

These findings are considered in the broader context of the need to design experiences that cater to engagement by families as a whole. We conclude by motivating the need for technologies that are robust in light of regular disengagement and by family members, and which provide functionality to directly support facilitation work.",

        "abstract": "Flamenco is a music tradition from Southern Spain that attracts a growing community of enthusiasts around the world. Its unique melodic and rhythmic elements, the typically spontaneous and improvised interpretation, and its diversity regarding styles make this still largely undocumented art form a particularly interesting material for musicological studies. In prior works, it has already been demonstrated that research on computational analysis of flamenco music, despite it being a relatively new field, can provide powerful tools for the discovery and diffusion of this genre. In this article, we present corpusCOFLA, a data framework for the development of such computational tools. The proposed collection of audio recordings and metadata serves as a pool for creating annotated subsets that can be used in development and evaluation of algorithms for specific music information retrieval tasks. First, we describe the design criteria for the corpus creation and then provide various examples of subsets drawn from the corpus. We showcase possible research applications in the context of computational study of flamenco music and give perspectives regarding further development of the corpus.",

        "abstract": "The need to preserve and live in cities with value and care for cultural heritage makes information technologies a tool to locate, document, describe, and visualize important urban contexts. With technology resources and the convergence of media such as text, data, maps, charts, pictures, and virtual models, among others, cultural heritage can be celebrated, contemplated, and admired more easily. However, creating an application for reactivation of cultural heritage by citizens remains a challenge because there is no clear methodology to be followed for its development. As far as we know, no one has proposed a methodological framework for applications in this field to determine which aspects should be considered and which tools should be used to successfully develop a cultural heritage application. This article proposes a methodological framework that allows a developer to categorize the type of cultural heritage application to develop and determine which types and quality of resources should be used in the application to provide good usability while fitting project requirements. The methodology is applied for the reactivation of Cisneros marketplace at Medellin, in Colombia, as a case study for testing the framework proposed. This article is part of a project called Reactivation of Cultural Heritage in Colombia using Information and Communication Technologies.",

        "abstract": "Ancient Chinese architecture from the Song dynasty is a prominent example of the ancient oriental architectures. The cai-fen system was a module system used for the carpentry of Song architectures, which was specified by the governmental manual, the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) compiled by Li Jie [1103]. We present a rule-based approach for generation of ancient Chinese architectures from the Song dynasty. Based on the special module system and the hierarchical topology of structural patterns in traditional Chinese architectures, the approach parameterizes the wooden elements of buildings and formalizes the construction rules for different architecture styles. In the approach, XML-based description files are generated for displaying the construction process. What the approach generates are standard architectures that strictly follow the ancient Chinese governmental manual. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, architectures in different styles have been generated based on their corresponding rules. The fundamental difference between our approach and previous works is that we apply and implement the module system in digitalization of ancient Chinese architecture.",

        "abstract": "We have experienced rapid development in Augmented Reality (AR) systems and platforms in the world of cultural heritage, namely in cultural settings and historical museums. However, we still face a range of challenges to design an AR system that meets the requirements for an AR installation working autonomously in a cultural heritage setting for an extended duration. This article describes the development of two installations for the visualization of a 3D reconstruction of a castle chapel, running autonomously during open hours in the location of a castle museum. We present a convincing 3D visualization running at interactive frame-rates on modern tablets. In one installation, the tablet is connected to a large screen TV for an immersive experience, and, in another, the tablet is hand-held, thus facilitating translational freedom in the chapel. Both installations allow unsupervised usage during museum visiting hours. Based on in-field observations and on-device logging of application usage, user behavior is analyzed and evaluated. Results indicate that users spent a limited amount of time using the application and did not fully explore the visual area of the chapel. In order for the user to spend more time with the application, additional information must be presented to the user.",

        "abstract": "Storytelling, especially in the form called drama, is pervasive across cultures and ages. Though much attention has been devoted to the preservation of the physical supports of drama (e.g., films and tapes), there is a widespread acknowledgment that such tangible heritage is the expression of an intangible notion of drama. This article introduces drama as a form of intangible cultural heritage and presents a solution for its preservation in terms of a formal encoding through a computational ontology. After the review of a formal representation of drama, called Drammar, developed in previous works, we show how an abstraction of drama can be encoded into a digital item. We also show how the method proposed is compliant with the major initiatives for the documentation of cultural heritage, namely CIDOC-CRM and FRBR. Finally, we test the applicability of our solution by showing how the major tenets of two well-known theories of drama can be encoded in Drammar and presenting the results of a focus group of drama scholars and practitioners who have accessed the encoding through a visualization system. The encoding and visualization system have turned out to be a promising support for teaching and investigating drama.",

A large amount of data has been collected and produced in the form of photographs, 3D models, maps, condition reports, and more. Here we discuss some of the different methods used to realize the potential of this data in different formats and for different purposes. The data are explored in both virtual and tangible settings, and—with the use of a touch table—a combination of both. We examine some alternative representations of this community-produced heritage data for educational, research, and public engagement applications.",

In this article, we present a novel interactive, low-cost approach to 3D reconstruction and compare it to a standard photogrammetry pipeline based on high-resolution photographs. Our novel real-time reconstruction pipeline is based on a low-cost, consumer-level hand-held RGB-D sensor. While scanning, the user sees a live view of the current reconstruction, allowing the user to intervene immediately and adapt the sensor path to the current scanning result. After a raw reconstruction has been acquired, the digital model is interactively warped to fit a geo-referenced map using a handle-based deformation paradigm. Even large sites can be scanned within a few minutes, and no costly postprocessing is required. The quality of the acquired digitized raw 3D models is evaluated by comparing them to actual imagery, a geo-referenced map of the excavation site, and a photogrammetry-based reconstruction. We made extensive tests under real-world conditions on an archeological excavation in Metropolis, Ionia, Turkey. We found that the reconstruction quality of our approach is comparable to that of photogrammetry. Yet, both approaches have advantages and shortcomings in specific setups, which we analyze and discuss.",

The article will focus on the development and implementation of a viable workflow for the production of high-quality 3D models of museum objects, based on the 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry of selected ancient Egyptian artefacts. The development of a robust protocol for the complete process chain for imaging cultural heritage artefacts, from the acquisition of 2D and/or 3D images to the development of interactive applications for the public audience, was a specific objective of the project. The workflow devised by the university museum team combines reference photography and 3D imaging with a curatorial review of the actual object to its digital counterpart. It also integrates methodologies for managing the accompanying metadatasets to record these activities. As final stage deliverables from the process, the museum is making high-quality 3D images of artefacts from its collection available through creation and dissemination of digital 3D multiplatform interactive applications in order to allow remote access and to enhance the museum's public engagement. This short article concludes with practical considerations for a 3D imaging workflow such as time and skills needed, 3D model quality, and expectation management.",

We developed TombSeer, an augmented reality application that aims to immerse the wearer in a museum space engaging two senses (seeing and gesturing) through a holographic heads-up interface that brings virtual, historical artifacts “back to life” through gestural interactivity. This article introduces the TombSeer software prototype and highlights the application of embodied interaction to museum visits using an emerging hardware platform for 3D interactive holographic images (e.g., Meta head-mounted display). This article discusses the TombSeer prototype's development and functionality testing with the Tomb of Kitines exhibit, which was conducted at The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada. TombSeer's embodied gestural and visual augmented reality experience functions to aesthetically enhance museum exhibits, cultural heritage sites, and galleries.",

Multi-resolution super-pixels are first extracted to represent each image. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to label each super-pixel region with a probability to belong to foreground glyph strokes. Pixelwise probability maps from multiple super-pixel resolution scales are then aggregated to cope with various stroke widths and background noise. A fully connected Conditional Random Field model is then applied to improve the labeling consistency. Segmentation results show that our system preserves delicate local details of the historic Maya glyphs with various stroke widths and also reduces background noise. As an application, we conduct retrieval experiments using the extracted binary images. Experimental results show that our automatically extracted glyph strokes achieve comparable retrieval results to those obtained using glyphs manually segmented by epigraphers in our team.",

        "abstract": "We propose three automatic algorithms for analyzing digitized medieval manuscripts, text block computation, text line segmentation, and special component extraction, by taking advantage of previous clustering algorithms and a template-matching technique. These three methods are completely automatic, so no user intervention or input is required to make them work. Moreover, they are all per-page based; that is, unlike some prior methods—that need a set of pages from the same manuscript for training purposes—they are able to analyze a single page without requiring any additional pages for input, eliminating the need for training on additional pages with similar layout. We extensively evaluated the algorithms on 1,771 images of pages of six different publicly available historical manuscripts, which differ significantly from each other in terms of layout structure, acquisition resolution, writing style, and so on. The experimental results indicate that they are able to achieve very satisfactory performance, that is, the average precision and recall values obtained by the text block computation method can reach as high as 98% and 99%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The problem of the restoration of broken artifacts, where large parts could be missing, is of high importance in archaeology. The typical manual restoration can become a tedious and error-prone process, which also does not scale well. In recent years, many methods have been proposed for assisting the process, most of which target specialized object types or operate under very strict constraints. We propose a digital shape restoration pipeline consisting of proven, robust methods for automatic fragment reassembly and shape completion of generic three-dimensional objects of arbitrary type. In this pipeline, first we introduce a novel unified approach for handling the reassembly of objects from heavily damaged fragments by exploiting both fracture surfaces and salient features on the intact sides of fragments, when available. Second, we propose an object completion procedure based on generalized symmetries and a complementary part extraction process that is suitable for driving the fabrication of missing geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real-world fractured objects and software implemented as part of the European Union--funded PRESIOUS project, which is also available for download from the project site.",
