Presented here is a geovisual reading of all three volumes of Karl Marx's Capital. Marx's seminal treatise on political economy is normally treated as a work of abstract conceptualization. However, Marx names hundreds of geographic locations in Capital, usually in a highly relational and dynamic fashion. It seemed to me there was enough geographic information contained in the volumes to produce a geovisually rich map, presenting the themes, places, and relationships in this text in a new and revealing way.
