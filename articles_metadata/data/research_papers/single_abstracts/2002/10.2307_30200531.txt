A range of inter-disciplinary discourses consider the computer-mediated writing space as a unique performance medium with characteristic protocols. Drawing on contemporary performance theory, literary criticism, and communication theory, the author proposes that technologists, academics, and artists are developing idiomatic rhetorics - a lingua franca - to explore the technical and expressive properties of the new "language machines" and their hypertextual environments. The role of improvisation - and its cross-disciplinary protocols - provides a further focus in the discussion of computing practice and performance.
