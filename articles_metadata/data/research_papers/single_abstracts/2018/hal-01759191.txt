The EUROPANGE project, involving both medievalists and computer scientists, aims to study the emergence of a corps of administrators in the Angevin controlled territories in the XIIIâ€“XV centuries. Our project attempts to analyze the officers' careers, shared relation networks and strategies based on the study of individual biographies. In this paper, we describe methods and tools designed to analyze these prosopographical data. These include OLAP analyzes and network analyzes associated with cartographic and chronological visualization tools.
