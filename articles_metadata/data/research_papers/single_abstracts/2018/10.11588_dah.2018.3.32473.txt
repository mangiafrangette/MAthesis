Digital 3D reconstruction methods have been widely applied to support research and the presentation of historical objects since the 1980s. Whereas 3D reconstruction has been incorporated into a multitude of research applications, essential methodological foundations for more widespread utilisation of digital reconstructions have yet to be developed. Against this background, the aim of this article is to consider the question as to how the methodology of 3D reconstruction alters research cultures in architectural and art history by exemplifying three problem areas, (1) research functions of 3D reconstructions and their drawback to a current research culture in art history, (2) consequences of cross-disciplinary project-based teamwork as main cooperation format within 3D reconstruction projects, and (3) problems and difficulties caused by imagery as primary media for research and communication.
