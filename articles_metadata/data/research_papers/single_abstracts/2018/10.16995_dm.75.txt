In the present paper we analyze nine manuscripts from the 11th–14th century Menaia (Greek: μηνάιον), Old-Slavic hymnographic texts, using a vector space model. The analysis and classification of the manuscripts in previous studies have been rather subjective. In an attempt to be objective we use contemporary research methods. Vector analysis allows one to separate the Putyatina Menaion and the Menaion Q.п.1.25 from the set of analyzed texts, since both manuscripts share both textological and lexical similarities. Similar findings were reached in existing studies. Manuscript BAN 16.14.13 is shown to be quite similar to the set of analyzed texts. The results are new to the literature.
