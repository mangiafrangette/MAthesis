Next to the primary goal of encoding and the systematic markup of the autobiographical documents in the manuscript collection of the Herzog August Library (HAB), it is of central importance for the project Selbstzeugnisse‹ der Frühen Neuzeit in der HAB (›Autobiographical writings of the early modern age in the Herzog August Library‹) to evaluate the options for producing and compiling texts and research results. In comparison with print-based methods, and using the group of autobiographical texts, the opportunities, advantages, and disadvantages of the scholarly distribution of information and communication should be explored. The Selbstzeugnisse in this project are defined as autobiographical writings, such as diaries, travel journals, or autobiographies, although the term is intentionally left open and is under discussion. The project results will be a finding aid to the Selbstzeugnisse using autoptic analysis of the manuscripts, a digital critical edition of the diary of Duke August the Younger of Braunschweig-Wolfenbuettel, and the presentation of the project results in a research portal.
