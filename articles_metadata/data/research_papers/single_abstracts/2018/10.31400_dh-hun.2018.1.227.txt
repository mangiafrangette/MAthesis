The NKFIH-project that seeks to publish the digital edition of Zsigmond Móricz’s (1892–1913) correspondence was launched in 2016 at the Petőfi Literary Museum in Budapest. The project itself has been a huge challenge for the Móricz-research group because they can only partially rely on the earlier paper-based edition. Drawing on the experiences and resolved problems of the first years of the project, this paper focuses on the harmonization and relationship of a museum's programming/IT possibilities, the philological problems and the applied software capacities. As the paper discusses the challenges of an ongoing project, the study does not offer a holistic and comprehensive overview of the entire project, rather a list of problems as encountered along the way and their solutions.
