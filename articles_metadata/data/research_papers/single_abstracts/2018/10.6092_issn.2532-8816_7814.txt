This paper introduces two projects in the realm of Digital Humanities, Mapping Visions of Rome and Digital Roman Heritage. The first project was conceived as a digital aid to my traditional research, while the second developed as a digital aid to the collaboration with other people and projects. Together they reflect how I, trained as a Latinist, entered the field of Digital Humanities, in which I have no specific training. The goal of this paper is therefore primarily to explore the opportunities offered by Digital Humanities for humanities researchers like myself who do not regard this field as their native soil but still wish to contribute to it and benefit from digital research infrastructures and technologies. In particular, it will reflect on the way in which Digital Humanities can further interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange, which I consider to be one of its greatest assets.
