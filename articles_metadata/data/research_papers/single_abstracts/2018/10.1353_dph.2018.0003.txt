Using the Estoria Digital as a case study, I examine some practical issues that may be encountered in collaborative digital editing projects of medieval texts: I describe some of the practical issues we encountered when creating the Estoria Digital, and some of the strategies we employed to overcome them. Focussing on transcription, collation, and regularization, I propose a model for their effective completion by more than one person. Finally, I consider if collaborative digital editing might be a misnomer in this context: what do we mean by collaborative and editing in the collaborative digital editing of medieval texts?
