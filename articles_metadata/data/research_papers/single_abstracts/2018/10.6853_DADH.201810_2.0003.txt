The author of Shiji (史記) is Sima Qian, but part of it was rewritten according to the old manuscript of his father Sima Tan. In addition to Sima Qian and Sima Tan, Chu Shaosun is also one of the authors of Shiji. This study used term frequency statistics tool on DocuSky to count 30 chapters of Shiji. Frist, I used virtual words in Shiji as the subject matter doing statistical analysis. And then used the writing of Chu Shaosun as a control group to compare the differences in the word frequency of the three people. And we can use digital methods to prove the similarities and differences between the authors of the Shiji.
