The Budapest Time Machine (Budapest Időgép, https://hungaricana.hu/hu/budapest-idogep/) is a recent project that offers innovative ways to use historical maps as a research tool. The web service contains overlapping maps from different periods with attached, geospacial, archival materials and photographs. These data present the recent history of Budapest and its geographic dimensions. This study demonstrates novel ways in which this resource can be used for research purposes.
