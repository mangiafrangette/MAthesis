CyArk is a California-based nonprofit dedicated to digitally documenting and preserving world heritage. Since 2003, they have used photogrammetry and laserscanning to capture 3D data for over 200 sites; most recently, they have partnered with Google Arts & Culture to create an open-access platform for these sites . Here, two members of the CyArk team, John Ristevski (Chairman and CEO) and Elizabeth Lee (Vice President of Programs and Development) sit down with Justin Underhill to discuss the past and present of digital cultural heritage.
