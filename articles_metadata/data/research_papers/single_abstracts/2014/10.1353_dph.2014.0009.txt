This article explains how the Llull DB, a database devoted to Ramon Llullâ€™s original works, apocryphal corpus, historical reception, and modern scholarship, was conceived and developed. In addition to addressing specific issues involved in the design of a database with a focus on the medieval author of a multilingual corpus that enjoyed a wide reception, this essay also shows how the Llull DB has provided the original template for a series of interconnected databases related to medieval Catalonia, and tackles the challenges posed by the need for an interoperative environment for all of them.
