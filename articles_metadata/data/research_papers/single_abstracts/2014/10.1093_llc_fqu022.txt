In this slightly modified version of my 2013 Roberto Busa Prize lecture, I look from the first four decades of digital humanities through its present toward a possible future. I find a means to construct this future by paying close attention to the enemy we need in order to grow: the fear that closed down the horizons of imaginative exploration during the years of the Cold War and that re-presents itself now clothed in numerous techno-scientific challenges to the human.
