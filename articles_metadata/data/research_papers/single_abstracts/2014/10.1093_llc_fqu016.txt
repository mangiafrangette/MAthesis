Based on Burrows's measure of stylometric difference that uses frequencies of most frequent words, Rolling Delta is a method for revealing stylometric signals of two (or more) authors in a collaborative text. It is applied here to study the texts written jointly by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford, producing results that generally confirm the usual critical consensus on the visibility of the two author's hand. It also confirms that Ford's claims to a sizeable fragment in Nostromo are unfounded.
