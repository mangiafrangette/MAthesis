This paper describes the evaluation of a WSD method within SENSEVAL. This method is based on Semantic Classification Trees (SCTs) and short context dependencies between nouns and verbs. The training procedure creates a binary tree for each word to be disambiguated. SCTs are easy to implement and yield some promising results. The integration of linguistic knowledge could lead to substantial improvement.
