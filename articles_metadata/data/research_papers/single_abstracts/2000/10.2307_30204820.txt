The article offers a case study of the relationship between current developments in Classical Studies and the impact of computing and IT. The first section summarises the main features of the Classical Studies environment, especially the deep seated changes which have been taking place. These changes are then related to specific initiatives in Research, Teaching and Learning. The discussion is framed by a statement of micro-criteria for the evaluation of new developments and by reference to the macro-climate of debate about the nature of cyberspace, especially the dichotomy between conceptions of post-modern diversity and of Enlightenment images of rational structures. It is suggested that these debates mirror those with which the discipline itself engages.
