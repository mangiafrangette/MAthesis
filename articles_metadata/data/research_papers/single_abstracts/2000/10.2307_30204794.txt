This work combines a set of available techniques - which could be further extended to perform noun sense disambiguation. We use several unsupervised techniques (Rigau et al., 1997) that draw knowledge from a variety of sources. In addition, we also apply a supervised technique in order to show that supervised and unsupervised methods can be combined to obtain better results. This paper tries to prove that using an appropriate method to combine those heuristics we can disambiguate words in free running text with reasonable precision.
