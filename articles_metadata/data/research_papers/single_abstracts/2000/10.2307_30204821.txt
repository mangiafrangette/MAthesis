Web-accessible conferencing software and "conversational ethics" drawn from Habermas and Rawls have successfully brought together on-line participants separated by geography and viewpoint, and occasionally resulted in consensus regarding otherwise divisive issues such as abortion. The author describes successes, limitations, and costs of incorporating these technologies and discourse ethics in a religious studies class. Results are striking, but the pedagogical benefits involve technical risks and high labor and time costs. This experience, coupled with recent research, suggests that electronic pedagogies, like other teaching strategies, work for some, but not all students: this argues that we take up electronic teaching as one approach among many.
