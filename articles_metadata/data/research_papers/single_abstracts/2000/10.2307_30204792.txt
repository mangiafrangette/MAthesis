SENSEVAL set itself the task of evaluating automatic word sense disambiguation programs (see Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, this volume, for an overview of the framework and results). In order to do this, it was necessary to provide a 'gold standard' dataset of 'correct' answers. This paper will describe the lexicographic part of the process involved in creating that dataset. The primary objective was for a group of lexicographers to manually examine keywords in a large number of corpus contexts, and assign to each context a sense-tag for the keyword, taken from the Hector dictionary. Corpus contexts also had to be manually part-of-speech (POS) tagged. Various observations made and insights gained by the lexicographers during this process will be presented, including a critique of the resources and the methodology.
