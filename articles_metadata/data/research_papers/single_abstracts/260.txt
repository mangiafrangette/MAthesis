Semi-automated extraction of details corresponding to narratological fabula from a corpus of narrative interviews on a single event provides decontextualized building blocks for transversal, or cross-document, narratives. With information extracted from 503 World Trade Center Task Force Interviews comprising 12,000 pages of testimony and novel visualization techniques, this article proposes a computational method for the emergence of narratives that cross beyond the boundaries of one interview. These assembled narratives, in cases like that of Chief Ganci, can document those who did not survive to tell their own story.
