This article examines the group of Machaut’s poems (a composite lai and ten ballades) copied into an anthology compiled by the French humanist Simon de Plumetot. More than half of the 155 items were composed by Eustache Deschamps, and most of the remainder are anonymous, but the collection has a markedly didactic character and many pieces make political allusions. The manuscript thus sets Machaut’s love poems in an unusual context. This essay argues that reading these poems as presented in the anthology enables the modern reader to approximate a medieval reading experience.
