We present an approach to shorten Ancient Greek sentences by using morpho-syntactic information attached to each word in a sentence. This work underpins the content of our eLearning application, AncientGeek, whose unique teaching technique draws from primary Greek sources. By applying a technique that skips the clausal dependents of a main verb, we reached a well-formed rate of 89% of the sentences.
