Ever since the Universal Networking Language (UNL) programme started in 1996, researchers and computational linguists across the globe have actively participated in this. English, Chinese, Georgian, Greek, Hindi, Punjabi, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Slovenian, etc., are some of the languages which are part of the UNL programme. Although previous years have witnessed significant interest and application development in UNL, UNL can be exploited for several different tasks in natural language engineering, such as multilingual document generation, summarization, text simplification, information retrieval, and semantic reasoning. Although UNL is language-independent artificial language, yet, existing UNL-based applications are standalone in the sense that they are language specific which supports the local natural language of the application developer. This article illustrates the cross-domain client application prototype that has been built to support the development of multilingual UNL-based applications where researchers, developers, or computational linguists across the globe can use this common application for UNL-ization and NL-ization. Output of the proposed system can further be utilized by any other UNL-based application. The proposed system is evaluated on the basis of two measures, i.e. accuracy and correctness. The accuracy of the proposed system is 100%. However, correctness of the proposed system depends upon the F-Measure of UNL-ization and NL-ization modules which has been consistently greater than 0.95 (on a scale of 0â€“1) for Punjabi language.
