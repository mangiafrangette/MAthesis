The use of the computer in Art History is changing the approach towards our objects of research. Now, we are able to compute more images than a human can see in a lifetime. That, in turn, calls for a new definition of the role of the researcher and the tools being used. The access to large amounts of visual data stands in a tradition of conventional methods of Art History, but also augments them with quantity. This article proposes a theoretical model on which to build an understanding of the meta image with which we interactively derive our conclusions.
