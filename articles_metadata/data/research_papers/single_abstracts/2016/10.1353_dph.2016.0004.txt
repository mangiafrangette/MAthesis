This chapter shakes up critical understanding of narrative voice in text and image of Machaut’s dits. It perceives narratorial activity as a function that, far from being proper to one party (“the narrator”), is inherently mobile, circulating around elements of a poem or miniature, whether human characters, animals or landscape features. Miniatures devised for the jugement poems are a particularly rich resource for analyzing this mobility being exploited by artists to draw attention to issues of narrative framing, communication and point of view – including, crucially, the point of view of the manuscript’s reader/viewer.
