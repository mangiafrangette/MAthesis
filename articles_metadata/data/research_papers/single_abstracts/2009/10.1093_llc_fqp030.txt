Part I of this series, [doi:10.1093/llc/fqp029], applied our ‘new-optics’ methodology to the ‘Shakespeare’ scenes in STMO and concluded that it had too much Shakespeare discrepancy to fit comfortably into the Canon. We considered it an improbable, but not impossible Shakespeare ascription for the 1600s and placed it for now in the High Apocrypha. We thought it extremely improbable that the whole of STMO could be by Shakespeare, or that the ‘Shakespeare’ parts could have been written in the 1590s. Part II, published here, addresses the ‘Shakespeare’ scenes of Edward III. Taken separately, four of the five ‘Shakespeare’ blocks of Edw3 fall inside our Shakespeare ballpark. So does a sixth block, scenes 4.05–4.09. If we followed the consensus strictly, all five Shakespeare blocks, taken as a group, would not make a probable solo Shakespeare ascription. However, if we switched 4.04 to ‘non-Shakespeare,’ and 4.05–4.09 to ‘Shakespeare,’ the revised Shakespeare blocks would be a plausible Shakespeare ascription even as a group, justifying the inclusion of Edw3 in the Canon as partly Shakespeare's: 1.02; 2.01–2.02; and 4.05–4.09. The odds that the ‘non-Shakespeare’ scenes, collectively, or individually (except for 4.05–4.09) could be his are vanishingly low.
