 Component models such as factor analysis can be used to analyse spatial distributions of a large number of different features – for instance the isogloss data in a dialect atlas, or the distributions of ethnological or archaeological phenomena – with the goal of finding dialects or similar cultural aggregates. However, there are several such methods, and it is not obvious how their differences affect their usability for computational dialectology. We attempt to tackle this question by comparing five such methods using two different dialectological data sets. There are some fundamental differences between these methods, and some of these have implications that affect the dialectological interpretation of the results.
