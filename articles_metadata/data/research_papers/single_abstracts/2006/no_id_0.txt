This paper presents a combination of literary studies and text technology. The goal of this work is to develop a formal representation and description system for literary characters. It should enable users either to search and compare literary characters and to integrate newly analysed characters. Technically, the system for description and representation is based on an ontology. The class system within the ontology is derived using literary character theories and own developed concepts. By using this description system new perspectives of literature and literary studies should be possible.
