We present our experience in developing an on-line infrastructure to support collaborative analysis of text, which we distinguish from existing, well-explored efforts to create annotative electronic editions. Using Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury as our primary text case, we outline the features and rationale of our collaborative framework, called Callimachus. We present our findings concerning that text and explore how these findings only became possible after breaking with the received wisdom concerning the application of XML and the Text Encoding Initiative to such analytical projects.
