Digital humanities require IT Infrastructure and sophisticated analytical tools, including data visualization, data mining, statistics, text mining and information retrieval. Regarding funding, to build a local data center will necessitate substantial investments. Fortunately, there is another option that will help researchers take advantage of these IT services to access, use and share information easily. Cloud services ideally offer on-demand software and resources over the Internet to read and analyze ancient documents. More interestingly, billing system is completely flexible and based on resource usage and Quality of Service (QoS) level. In spite of its multiple advantages, outsourcing computations to an external provider arises several challenges. Specifically, security is the major factor hindering the widespread acceptance of this new concept. As a case study, we review the use of cloud computing to process digital images safely. Recently, various solutions have been suggested to secure data processing in cloud environement. Though, ensuring privacy and high performance needs more improvements to protect the organization's most sensitive data. To this end, we propose a framework based on segmentation and watermarking techniques to ensure data privacy. In this respect, segementation algorithm is used to to protect client's data against untauhorized access, while watermarking method determines and maintains ownership. Consequentely, this framework will increase the speed of development on ready-to-use digital humanities tools.
