 Annotation and research in the humanities are tightly coupled. Annotations can be seen as expressions of research activity which can be turned into input data for subsequent research. The digital paradigm has profoundly altered the ways in which we humans can handle the information content of our sources and it also affects the practice of annotation. We explore new ways of annotation that were not feasible before the digital times, and we list a few requirements for annotation to act as a reliable source of research information. Rather than conducting an academic discussion on the ontology of annotations, we highlight practical use cases for new kinds of annotations. We illustrate those in a concrete system for linguistic annotations to the Hebrew Bible, SHEBANQ.
