Digitization of dictionaries originally in book form as well as the creation of online dictionaries has revolutionized the way dictionaries are presented and offers not only the opportunity of presenting textual links between dictionary headwords but the possibility of directly connecting one online dictionary to another. This article is an introduction to one of the new functions of the online Anglo-Norman dictionary, i.e. cross-referencing, the provision of links from the Anglo-Norman dictionary entries to other relevant medieval and modern dictionaries. In addition to establishing the usefulness of cross-referencing for dictionary users and presenting how this has been achieved in the Anglo-Norman dictionary, this article examines some of the potential pitfalls that need to be addressed when implementing live links to other dictionaries.
