A glowing tribute to Anne de France, duchess of Bourbon, appears on one of the final folios of Paris, BnF, MS fr. 24392, a fifteenth-century collection notable for its rehabilitation of Jean de Meun. The encomium, composed between 1488 and 1498, praises Anne for serving as regent for her brother, the future King Charles VIII. Citing her many attributes, the poet likens Anne's eloquence to that of Christine de Pizan. How and why he makes this comparison is the subject of this two-part article. I conclude that it is not by accident that the encomium poet added his compliment to Anne to Fran√ßais 24392.
