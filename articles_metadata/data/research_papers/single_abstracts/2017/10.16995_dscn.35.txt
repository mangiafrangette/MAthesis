That the 2012 Congress of the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences censored the Bonfire of the Humanities, a student-produced alternate reality game, apparently in order to preserve the reputations of its invited speakers and host universities is an alarming incident worthy of further inquiry and censure by Canada's scholarly and artistic communities. Curiously, the justification provided for censoring the game echoes the ethical arguments advanced by scholars and designers of pervasive games who warn that non-player bystanders are at risk of confusing games with reality. This essay considers the case in relation to Jacques Ranci√®re's ethics of recognition. I argue that pervasive gamers should stop disguising their activities to protect bystanders, and begin instead to recognize non-players as equally capable of negotiating the blurred boundaries of game and world. The emancipation of game spectatorship creates genuinely political encounters, and opens up new channels for scholarly experimentation and dissemination.
