In this paper we introduce the numerical tools that have been developed in the context of the Graphem project, in order to automate or leverage several steps in the study of medieval writing samples. We first describe various kinds of features that have been extracted from the samples, and then present two graphical tools to compare writing samples according to the features that have been extracted.
