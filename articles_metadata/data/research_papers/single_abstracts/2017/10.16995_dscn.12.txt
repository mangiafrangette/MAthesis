 In this chapter, we assess how existing digital projects that feature women's manuscripts (c. 1550-1900) can aid research on literature, history, and cultural studies. We argue that the best digital remediations of women's manuscripts contribute, paradoxically, both to their hypermediacy (those elements that remind users they are not faced with a manuscript) and their immediacy (those aspects that hide the remediation and encourage users not to reflect on the medium). We showcase the range of scholarly engagement possible through a variety of sites, including British Literary Manuscripts Online, Perdita Manuscripts, and Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts. Analyzing these resources demonstrates how they can best be used by teachers and scholars. By evaluating digital remediations of women's manuscripts, we highlight best practices for manuscript digitization and point to new directions for digital projects and literary study.
