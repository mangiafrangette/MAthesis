 Aequilibrium is a transmedia and location-based experience which engages players in an adventure that blurs the boundaries between digital and physical spaces, imaginary and real people from the local community. The project is the first Italian Alternate Reality Game (ARG) dedicated to Leonardo Da Vinci and is aimed at promoting the territory of Lomellina adopting innovative communication strategies to engage players in a game which is designed to amuse and encourage tourism. The transmedia and the locative experience were designed by a team of researchers from the Politecnico di Torino and Guglielmo Marconi University. Starting from the analysis of the Aequilibrium project, this essay focuses on how alternate reality games can promote participation in cultural experiences which offer cultural activators fostering collaboration and creative grassroots production within communities of players.
