Software plays a significant role in modern academic research, yet lacks a similarly significant presence in the scholarly record. With increasing interest in promoting reproducible research, curating software as a scholarly resource not only promotes access to these tools, but also provides recognition for the intellectual efforts that go into their development.

In addition, it shows how these guidelines have been integrated into existing tools and community cultures, and provides recommendations for future software curation efforts. Â
