In this article, we present current stylometric studies on Delta. (1) We discuss why the use of cosine similarity improves the rate of success; our experiments on vector normalization lead to a better understanding of how Delta works. (2) Based on a corpus of Middle High German texts, we show that metrical properties can also be used for authorship attribution. The degree to which Delta is influenced by non-normalized medieval spellings is also investigated. (3) Using a corpus of Arabic-Latin translations, we explore how selective feature elimination can be used to separate the translator signal from the genre signal.
