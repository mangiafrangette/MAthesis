This article canvasses the multiple meanings of the word "social" in the contexts of editions, editing and texts. It may refer to a theory of editing; to varieties of practice; to manners of making; or to characterize the edition itself. Further, not all editions which claim to be "social," in any of these senses, are any such thing. A particularly egregious example is the so-called "Social edition of the Devonshire manuscript," whose claim to be "social" is poorly based. However, there is real potential in the making of editions which are more inclusive in their making, which achieve a wider impact and create new understandings in expanding circles of readership, whether or not we choose to label these as "social."
