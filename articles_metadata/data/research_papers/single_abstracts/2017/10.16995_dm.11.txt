This article reports on three case studies of research projects looking at the conversion of legacy resources. The first of these, the CURSUS Project (http://www.cursus.uea.ac.uk), has created electronic editions of medieval Benedictine liturgical service books. The second was some personal research into proof-of-concept conversion of printed volumes of the Records of Early English Drama project (http://www.reed.utoronto.ca/). The final case formed part of a pilot project studying the problems and possibilities of converting legacy electronic resources archived by the Oxford Text Archive (http://www.ota.ox.ac.uk/). While each of these projects was converting from a different form of media—manuscript, print and electronic—they benefitted from many of the same techniques and overcame many of the same hurdles.
