This case study offers strategies for TEI-based projects with limited funding. By focusing on the needs of our volunteers, the Victorian Women Writers Project has developed truly collaborative relationships with the project’s partners. Contributions to the project’s resources have grown out of digital humanities survey courses, literature classes, and independent work. The paper concludes with a brief sketch of our efforts to support continued work by rethinking our social media outreach and our online presence.
