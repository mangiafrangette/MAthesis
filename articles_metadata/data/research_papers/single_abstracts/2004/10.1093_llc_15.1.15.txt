The Perseus digital library is a substantial test bed of materials on archaic and classical Greece, the early Roman empire, and early modern Europe. The Perseus architecture includes tools that fit the needs of humanists: linguistic analysis for heavily inflected languages, linking and alignment with canonical citation schemes, and terminological, spatial, and visual databases for document contextualization. These tools provide both the scalability to connect disparate entities in the digital library and a groundwork for performance of the synthetic scholarship of the humanities.
