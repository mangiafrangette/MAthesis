The Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI's) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (Chicago, Oxford TEI P3) provide an extremely rich set of mechanisms for the encoding of medieval manuscripts and other primary textual sources. For a number of problems regularly encountered in the transcription of Old Norse/Icelandic materials, however, the solutions offered by the TEI have not proved entirely satisfactory. A group of scholars from several Scandinavian universities has been working for the last 4 years on a set of recommendations for modifications and extensions to the TEI DTD to be used in the encoding of such material. The present paper discusses some of these recommendations.
