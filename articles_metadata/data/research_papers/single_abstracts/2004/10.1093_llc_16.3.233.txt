The opening portions of the Pauline epistles display characteristic patterns that are scale related. They are the result of interaction between cycles comprising groups of longer and shorter sentences and the contrast between an opening high-scale section and a following low-scale section of the text. This interaction produces patterns in the several epistles which are not identical but whose features are scale related. Similar patterns may be produced mathematically, and the correspondence of the sentence patterns found in the texts to those of the mathematical model indicates that there are links between epistles that have not hitherto been identified. Studies using traditional or statistical methods have not yet taken into account the scale variable, which is ubiquitous in literature. No longer can texts be assumed to be homogeneous in this respect. The identification of these scale-related patterns is of importance in matters of author determination.
