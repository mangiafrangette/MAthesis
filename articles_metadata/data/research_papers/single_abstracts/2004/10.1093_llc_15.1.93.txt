Modularity, professionality, portability, and integration are the key features of the TUebingen System for TExt Processing programs (TUSTEP), a professional toolbox for those academic fields where texts are the object of research. Its potential is illustrated by two examples: (i) typesetting a TEI-lite encoded text, using the TEI tags as formatting instructions; (ii) preparing a critical edition, starting from automatic collation, then semi-automatically selecting the 'substantial' variants from the collation results, transforming them into a critical apparatus, and publishing the edition both in print and electronically.
