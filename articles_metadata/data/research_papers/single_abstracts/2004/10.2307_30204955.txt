This paper presents an automatic construction of Korean WordNet from preexisting lexical resources. We develop a set of automatic word sense disambiguation techniques to link a Korean word sense collected from a bilingual machine-readable dictionary to a single corresponding English WordNet synset. We show how individual links provided by each word sense disambiguation method can be non-linearly combined to produce a Korean WordNet from existing English WordNet for nouns.
