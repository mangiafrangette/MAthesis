This article describes the background and architecture of The Versioning Machine, a software tool designed to display and compare multiple versions of texts. The display environment provides for features traditionally found in codex‚Äêbased critical editions, such as annotation and introductory material. It also takes advantage of opportunities afforded by electronic publishing, such as providing a frame to compare diplomatic versions of witnesses side by side, allowing for manipulatable images of the witness to be viewed alongside the diplomatic edition, and providing users with an enhanced typology of notes.
