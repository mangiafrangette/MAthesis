Responses in personal interviews about education and career with 415 Swedish men and women (age 34) forms the basis of a speech corpus with 1.8 million words. The vocabulary is described by means of two sets of variables. One is based on the number of tokens and types, word length and sectioning of the running text. The other set divides the corpus into grammatical categories. Both sets of variables are related to a number of background variables such as gender, socioeconomic background, education, and indicators of verbal proficiency at age 13 and 32. This possibility to study the relationship between vocabulary and a broad set of respondent characteristics is a unique feature of this corpus.
