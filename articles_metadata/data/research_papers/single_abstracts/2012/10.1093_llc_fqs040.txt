Estrategias Contempor√°neas de Lectura is a project focused on research and teaching that emphasizes the importance of interpretation in the study of Classical Antiquity. The aim of the project is to support research with digital tools that document the process by which a perspective point or horizon of interpretation is constructed, by following the development of individual and group work processes. The progress of the project has posed theoretical and technical challenges related to a diversity of methodologies and expectations of the project. However, the development of these discussions has showed the relevance of interpretation and its complexity, making it a fruitful experience.
