This article offers a codicological description of the most complete extant manuscript containing the poetry of Ausiàs March (Valencia, 1400–1459). It lays out the material characteristics of the codex, and sets them in contrast with a matrix of relevant features from other witnesses of March’s poetry. As a result, this study uncovers several of the stages in the compilatory process of the manuscript and argues for it having been originally owned by Ferrando de Cardona, Admiral of Naples and Duke of Somma (Naples, 1521-Sant Cugat del Vallès, 1571).
