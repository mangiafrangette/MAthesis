Understanding the methods and processes implemented by data producers to generate research data is essential for fostering data reuse. Yet, producing the metadata that describes these methods remains a time-intensive activity that data producers do not readily undertake. In particular, researchers in the long tail of science often lack the financial support or tools for metadata generation, thereby limiting future access and reuse of data produced. The present study investigates research journal publications as a potential source for identifying descriptive metadata about methods for research data. Initial results indicate that journal articles provide rich descriptive content that can be sufficiently mapped to existing metadata standards with methods-related elements, resulting in a mapping of the data production process for a study. This research has implications for enhancing the generation of robust metadata to support the curation of research data for new inquiry and innovation.
