The debate on medieval textuality is shaped by an obvious reservation about the category of authorship. Therefore, the conditions for the acceptance of stylometric methods in the field of Middle High German literature might not seem too favorable. However, it is exactly this tension between tradition and individuality, which bears great significance for those texts, that offers opportunities for the application of stylometric methods, which can lead to a mutual elucidation of method and discipline. The paper provides examples of the ways in which Middle High German texts are influenced by individual as well as genre-specific style factors. Furthermore, it elaborates on the issues that must be addressed for a proper quantification of these categories.
