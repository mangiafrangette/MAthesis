This paper presents the digital edition of an important text in German literary history. The satirical magazine Die Fackel (The Torch) was published by the satirist and language critic Karl Kraus in Vienna from 1899 until 1936. The digital edition of the AAC-Fackel was developed by researchers, scholars, programmers, and designers within the framework of the AAC-Austrian Academy Corpus, operated by the Institute for Corpus Linguistics and Text Technology at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, and went online on 1 January 2007. The AAC-Fackel offers free online access to the 37 volumes, 415 issues, and 922 issues, comprising 22,586 pages and more than 6 million word forms of Die Fackel and contains a fully searchable database of the entire journal with indexes and search and navigation tools in a functionally designed interface, in which all pages of the original journal are available as digital texts and as facsimile images. The general principles of this scholarly digital edition, and its concept and design considerations, are based on a corpus-based methodological approach and are decisive for addressing questions of critical editions and philological access to this key text in German literary history.
