Especially in the early modern period, musicians were a highly mobile group that traveled throughout Europe and beyond. Accordingly, they significantly stimulated the formation of a common European cultural identity. Two successive, international music research projects are exploring this topic with different emphases. Each project database uses the same database system in a different way and with different objectives. Using case studies, appropriate research data visualizations are discussed, which will be further developed in the ongoing projects.
