Open review projects and wikis are changing academic knowledge production, just as academic blogs and social media are influencing scholarly communication. These digital forms of publishing challenge the usual practices of publishing and the concepts of authorship within the humanities, both practically and categorically. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the concept of ›scholarly authorship‹ by differentiating new forms of academic collaborative writing and to reflect on the academic quality of the new media formats within the humanities. This can be shown when analyzing self-curated digital publishing infrastructures and open license models of intellectual property.
