This essay proposes a methodology for the analysis of poetic digital works, based on the procedural model. This methodology is here applied to Jean-Marie Duteyâ€™s le mange-texte. The article will provide a reminder of the definition of some concepts and highlight the various effects on the work of the changes in technical contexts of execution. The program is also being studied in a rhetorical dimension. This paper demonstrates that a reading of the screen is not enough to reach all the aesthetic representations of the work and aims to complete it with an operation of meta-reading. We will then analyze the rhetorical level induced by the execution and show why the obsolescence of the work does not mean the death of the work.
