In this paper a number of issues relating to the application of string processing techniques on musical sequences are discussed. A brief survey of some musical string processing algorithms is given and some issues of melodic representation, abstraction, segmentation and categorisation are presented. This paper is not intended to provide solutions to string processing problems but rather to highlight possible stumbling-block areas and raise awareness of primarily music-related particularities that can cause problems in matching applications.
