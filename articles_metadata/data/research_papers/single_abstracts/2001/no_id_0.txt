Many paper based scholarly editions struggle with the limitations of paper and the typographic means of expression. They are difficult to use, potentially incomplete, and in many cases they do not meet the informational needs and expectations of the users. Digital editions offer serious solutions to many of these problems. They should not be seen simply as ›improved‹ editions, but as a new form of philological data storage. The computer allows new types of scholarly editions and new methods for accessing the data. It therefore is no longer necessary to offer all scholarly editions in print.
