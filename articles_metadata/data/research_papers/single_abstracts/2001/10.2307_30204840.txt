Musical patterns that recur in approximate, rather than identical, form within a composition (or body of musical work) are considered to be of considerable importance in music analysis. Here we consider the "evolutionary chain problem": this is the problem of computing a chain of all "motif" recurrences, each of which is a transformation of ("similar" to) the original motif, but each of which is progressively further from the original. Here we consider several variants of the evolutionary chain problem and we present efficient algorithms for solving them.
