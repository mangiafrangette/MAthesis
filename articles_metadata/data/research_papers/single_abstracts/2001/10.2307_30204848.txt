This paper presents two grammars for reading numbers of classical and modern Arabic language. The grammars make use of the structured Arabic counting system to present an accurate and compact grammar that can be easily implemented in different platforms. Automating the process of reading numbers from its numerical representation to its sentential form has many applications. Inquiring about your bank balance over the phone, automatically writing the amount of checks (from numerical form to letter form), and reading for the blind people are some of the fields that automated reading of numbers can be of service. The parsing problem of sentential representation of numbers in the Arabic language is also addressed. A grammar to convert from sentential representation to the numerical representation is also presented. Grammars presented can be used to translate from the sentential Arabic numbers to sentential English numbers, and vice versa, by using the common numerical representation as an intermediate code. Such methodology can be used to aid the automatic translation between the two natural languages. All grammars described in this paper have been implemented on a UNIX system. Examples of different number representations and the output of the implementation of the grammars are given as part of the paper.
