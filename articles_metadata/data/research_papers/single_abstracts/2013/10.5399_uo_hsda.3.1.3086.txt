Working from transcriptions generated through the T-PEN program at St. Louis University, the collaborators of the project "Petrarch’s Early Manuscripts and Incunabula in the Oregon Petrarch Open Book" are presently digitizing and encoding in TEI P5 2 key interpretative copies of Petrarch’s Rvf: the late 14th-century manuscript copy from the Queriniana Library in Brescia, D II 21, the Queriniana Library’s copy of the first printed edition (editio princeps) of the Rvf edited by Cristoforo [Berardi?] and published by Vindelin de Speier (Spira) in Venice in 1470. The first part of the article traces a brief history of the Oregon Petrarch Open Book (OPOB), the last section introduces a future project, “Texts, Images and Interpretation in the OPOB”.
