Recent work on the history of emotions, particularly by Barbara Rosenwein, has explored the idea of “emotional communities” as a means of uncovering the complex layers of identity and self-definition among individuals in past societies. Here I wish to explore three brief examples from French texts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the light of this enquiry. Two are from well-known literary figures (Chrétien de Troyes and Marie de France) while the other is by Guillaume le Breton, biographer and panegyrist of the French king Philip II Augustus (r. 1180–1223). Each writer uses the image of the garden to illustrate the emotional standpoint of prominent individuals and communities within his or her text. The range of emotions on display—jealousy, grief, anger, fear, love, and even something we might label “national pride”—attests to the power of the garden image as a conveyor of meaning for medieval authors and audiences alike.
