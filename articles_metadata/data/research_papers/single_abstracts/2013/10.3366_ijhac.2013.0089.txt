 This methodological paper sets out a definition of, and a vision for, a deep map. A deep map is defined as a platform and a means of expressing historical narratives, and seeks to move beyond the current situation, where time is presented as an attribute of space, and space as an attribute of text. It sets out a conceptual design of a deep map which brings all three together, allowing articulation of a narrative in the history of one denomination of US religion, the Unitarian church in Indianapolis in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
