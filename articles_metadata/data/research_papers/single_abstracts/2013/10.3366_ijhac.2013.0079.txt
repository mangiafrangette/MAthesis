 This paper is concerned with the development of digital humanities infrastructure – tools and resources which make using existing e-content easier to discover, utilise and embed in teaching and research. The past development of digital content in the humanities (in the United Kingdom) is considered with its resource-focused approach, as are current barriers facing digital humanities as a discipline. Existing impacts from e-infrastructure are discussed, based largely on the authors’ own discrete or collaborative projects. This paper argues that we need to consider further how digital resources are actually used, and the ways in which future digital resources might enable new types of research questions to be asked. It considers the potential for such enabling resources to advance digital humanities significantly in the near future.
