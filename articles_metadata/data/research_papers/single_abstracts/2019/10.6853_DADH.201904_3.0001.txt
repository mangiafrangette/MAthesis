Ancient Chinese scriptures usually have no punctuation marks, which makes it difficult for modern people to read and understand. Adding modern punctuation to ancient scriptures is the basis for the collation and research of ancient scriptures, however, it is a very tedious process. Therefore, it is of practical significance to realize automatic punctuation of ancient scriptures by means of artificial intelligence (AI). We apply the latest tool of deep learning (DL) in the field of natural language processing (NLP) to train the two models of long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolution neural network (CNN) on a training set of more than 50 million Chinese characters and approximately 10 million punctuations. Then, on the test set of Buddhist texts from six different dynasties, the highest punctuation accuracy of 94.3% was achieved. At present, the system can mark seven kinds of modern punctuations (comma, period, question mark, exclamation mark, dunhao, semicolon, colon) for ancient texts.
