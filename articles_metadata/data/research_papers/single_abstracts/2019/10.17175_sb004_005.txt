The paper approaches the problem of the loss of sources (deperdita) from three different perspectives: In a first section, deperdita are identified as a methodological area of uncertainty for historical research and possible categorisations are proposed. The following case study from the work of the Anton Webern Gesamtausgabe illustrates the consequences of such defects in cultural memory caused by missing sources, before proposals for graph-based modeling of negations and deperdita are presented in the last part. The aim of the discussion is to raise awareness of the challenges involved in dealing with historical material that is no longer available and for a constructive and productive approach to uncertainties.
