Libraries and librarians can support digital humanists not only by having expertise in identifying objectives and working out ways of realization, informed by library and information science (LIS) but because both the digital humanities and LIS have several themes and issues in common. LIS aims to explore and understand the world of information and its human factors, and the latter is in the focus of digital humanistsâ€™ research as well. Besides showcasing these common features, examples of services offered to digital humanists (mainly) in Anglo-American academic libraries are presented in the paper.
