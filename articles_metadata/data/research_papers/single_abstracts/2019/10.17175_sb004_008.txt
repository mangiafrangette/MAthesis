This paper looks at how deep integration between text and data is attempted in The Codex project. Standoff properties are used to mediate between the plain text stream and entities modelled in the Neo4j graph database. A dynamic standoff property text editor was constructed to enable real-time changes to text and annotations without invalidating standoff property indexes. An examination of the multidimensional affordances offered by standoff properties is explored, with reference to how annotations and graph entities can combine to construct an ›atlas of history‹ using Codex.
