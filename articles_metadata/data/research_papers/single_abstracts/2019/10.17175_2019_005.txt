The focus of this contribution is the presentation and discussion of the conceptual design of an XML database of fairytales (expandable to other popular narrative genres) and the required digital infrastructure. The purpose is a worldwide systematization of archival material through a suitable database and the development of a content annotation standard (ConAS) for the typological-comparative analysis of the international fairytales.
