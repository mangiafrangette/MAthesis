Using a specific research project, this article presents an approach for displaying phenomena of uncertainty in humanities contexts – here, legal history – in a data model. In the proposal for modeling a research context, the core thesis depends on three levels that describe a) the historical phenomena, b) the traditional evidence for this phenomena, and c) the latest historical research. Although ambiguities and uncertainties will be present on all three levels, they will be modeled on the third level only since they can not be separated from the historical research. The following paper presents the research project ›Die Regierung der Universalkirche nach dem Konzil von Trient‹ with regard to uncertainties in data modeling (1.). The preliminary, at times unofficial, data model will then be described (2.); finally, this article will discuss future prospects for the further development of the model as well as challenges within the context of the project, such as in data entry and processing (3.).
