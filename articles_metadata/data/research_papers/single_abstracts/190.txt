This article presents a model of author dictionary in the field of Latin lexicography. It proposes an organization of the microstructure of its entries following S. C. Dikâ€™s Functionalist Grammar linguistic principles, especially when describing the predicative frameworks. The objective of this article is to provide the user of the lexicon with a suitable tool to disambiguate meanings, thanks to the description of the predicative frameworks and the relationships the different lemmatized units keep. To proceed so, an XML file has been used as the support of the dictionary which is contrasted with its correspondent DTD. This guarantees the adequacy of the principle of hierarchic representation of this metalanguage as well as its lexicographic exploitation in computational linguistics.
