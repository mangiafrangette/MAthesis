This paper investigates the issue of ＂paradigm shift＂ in humanities research in the digital era, mainly from the perspective of ＂evidential research＂-meaning textual criticism based on the investigation of both internal and external evidence. All humanities research, whether from the traditional or digital era, must be based on a foundation of ＂data＂ and ＂evidential research.＂ But the forms of data, the challenges one might encounter while using these data, as well the as the methods and tools of ＂evidential research,＂ are constantly changing. Thus, our ＂paradigm＂ for humanities research in the digital era must also necessarily be constantly shifting. Consequently, in this digital era dominated by data and robots, humanities scholars need to study both digital technology and the humanities so that they can combine both humanistic erudition and ＂computational thinking.＂ However, the combination of these two does not guarantee that we can then soar unimpeded through the cosmos of the digital world. After all, this combination constitutes mere ＂literacy,＂ not ＂skill.＂ This new type of literacy may be called ＂digital textual criticism.＂
