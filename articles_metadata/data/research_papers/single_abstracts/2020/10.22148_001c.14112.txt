Hosted out of the University of Virginia, Digital Yoknapatawpha is an international collaboration between scholars of William Faulkner and technologists at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities. The project team has encoded all the locations, characters, and events in Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha fictions into a relational database that powers an open-access web-portal. Users can avail of an atlas of “deep-maps,” data visualizations, archival material, and aural and visual resources to explore, teach, and research his works. Using techniques common in ecology and demography, this paper leverages the data to investigate the relationship between race, kinship, and space. It concludes, tentatively, that the social world of Yoknapatawpha is far more rigidly bounded along racial lines than current scholarship suggests. In particular, most interactions between characters from different races happen in a familial context, and are the result of racialized labor exploitation or outright enslavement of African-American families by Anglo-Americans. The lack of interactions outside of this context underscores just how little agency non-white characters have in Faulkner’s fiction.
