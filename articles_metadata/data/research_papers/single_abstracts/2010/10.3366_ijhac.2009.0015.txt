 This papers starts with some mysterious contribution by Michel Foucault (1967) about heterotopias as special epistemological sites. With a recent case-study – an immersive virtual reality art project dealing with some ancient abbey reconstruction and managed by a French engineering school – we analyse the successive attempts to satisfy the system users by extending Foucault's heterotopology, which appears to be useful and creative for the Virtual Reality research communities.
