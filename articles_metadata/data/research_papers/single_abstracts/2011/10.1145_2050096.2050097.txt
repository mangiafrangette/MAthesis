The article reports the results of a usability test applying digital smartpen technology and interactive audio booklets to assist the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma in revitalization of the Myaamia language and culture. The usability test was conducted to determine if computer technology such as smartpens can provide an effective tool in the Tribe's home-based education initiative. Previous efforts in the use of computer technology language revitalization are reviewed and found to offer promise. The smartpen technology is reviewed, the interactive booklets and programmed smartpen are described, and usability test results are analyzed. Encouraging findings have led to interest in further development of additional technological tools that could be incorporated into “home learning kits.” Additionally, by interchanging sound files, the smartpen software can be adapted easily to support language revitalization work by other communities.
