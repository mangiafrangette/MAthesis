Considering the immortality of electronic corpora in the literary edition of the Musil estate The digital Klagenfurt edition of the works of Robert Musil contains the complete transcript of the writers Nachlass, his literary estate.[1] The estate compiles about 12,000 pages from Musils manuscripts; it includes all data collected since 1985, when work on the project began, until the year of publication of the first full edition of his work on DVD in 2009. The transcribed data underwent several interesting metamorphoses throughout the process; the transformation reflects the history of digital philology itself. Out review of the project is geared both towards philological aspects, like the changed status of transcripts within edition projects, and the different transcription systems; as well as technical aspects, like changes in hardware, software and publication formats.
