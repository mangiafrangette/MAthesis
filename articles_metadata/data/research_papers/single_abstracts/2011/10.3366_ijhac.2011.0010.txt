 Laser scanning of stone sculpture creates accurate digital models that may be accessed and interpreted by a wide range of end users at many levels of education and experience.

Revisualising the monument is only one aspect of the scholarly process. Renewed interpretations of cultural heritage objects in digital media provide many answers but also stimulate further challenges for humanities computing, notably, how to address the non-machine readable elements of cultural heritage data.
