The nearest shrunken centroid (NSC) methodology, originally developed for high-dimensional genomics problems, was recently applied in a stylometric study. Although NSC has many advantages, stylometric problems usually differ from genomics problems in several important ways: texts are of a wide range of sizes, a large series of texts are often the subjects for classification, and most importantly the set of candidate authors cannot usually be assumed to be closed. Consequently, na√Øve application of NSC methodology can produce misleading results. We extend the NSC methodology for more general application to stylometry. Reanalysis of the Book of Mormon using the open-set NSC method produced dramatically different results from a closed-set NSC analysis.
