 The work of scholars is rapidly changing. As new digital resources and tools are developed, and old tools and resources reinvented for the digital world, the practice of scholarship is quickly adapting to the expectations that content should be accessible from anywhere, that it is a raw material to be manipulated, and that an excess of information is the major challenge facing scholars. Despite these expectations, the current generation of tools are inadequate for emerging scholarly practices. JSTOR's Advanced Technology Research (ATR) group has built and collaborated on a number of software projects and platforms that attempt to provide the next generation of tools for scholars. We provide an overview of these projects.
