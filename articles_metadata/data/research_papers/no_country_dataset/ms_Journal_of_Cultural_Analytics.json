We find that the majority of works of Victorian literature that are indicated as being read on Goodreads occur about as often as they are taught or written about in the academy, although books aimed at an adult audience are written about more frequently in peer-reviewed venues. Interestingly, those works that are statistical outliers in terms of their greater popularity with a general audience than an academic audience tend to feature women authors, children’s literature, and works with a strong female protagonist. Turning to an analysis of the written reviews on Goodreads of three outliers that were more popular with a general audience--A Tale of Two Cities, Jane Eyre, and The Secret Garden--we find that readers tend to comment on plot (especially in Dickens), feminist themes (in Jane Eyre), and the importance of characters (in all three works). In conclusion, we suggest ways in which postsecondary teachers might draw on these results to inform their syllabi and formulate strategies for teaching Victorian literature.

The proportion of female faces first peaked in the mid-to-late 1940s. This was followed by a dip lasting from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s. The 1970s saw another peak followed by a dip over the course of the 1980s. Finally, we see a slow and steady rise in the proportion of female faces from the early 1990s onwards.

This essay builds on that research, shedding light on several historical trends concerning anatomical description and its relationship to gender.

Other evidence implies that bodily characteristics were increasingly bifurcated along a gender binary, reflecting how characters are more and more physically sorted along a feminine-masculine axis. Taken altogether, this essay unpacks a suggestive correlation: a growing aspect of characterization was increasingly imbricated in heteronormative discourses.
