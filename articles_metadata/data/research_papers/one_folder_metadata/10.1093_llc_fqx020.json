This article reports on a pilot project at University College London, working in collaboration with the British Library, to scope out how best high-performance computing facilities can be used to facilitate the needs of researchers in the humanities. Using institutional data-processing frameworks routinely used to support scientific research, we assisted four humanities researchers in analysing 60,000 digitized books, and we present two resulting case studies here. This research allowed us to identify infrastructural and procedural barriers and make recommendations on resource allocation to best support non-computational researchers in undertaking ‘big data’ research. We recommend that research software engineer capacity can be most efficiently deployed in maintaining and supporting data sets, while librarians can provide an essential service in running initial, routine queries for humanities scholars. At present there are too many technical hurdles for most individuals in the humanities to consider analysing at scale these increasingly available open data sets, and by building on existing frameworks of support from research computing and library services, we can best support humanities scholars in developing methods and approaches to take advantage of these research opportunities.", "article_title": "Enabling complex analysis of large-scale digital collections: humanities research, high-performance computing, and transforming access to British Library digital collections", "authors": [{"given": " Melissa", "family": "Terras", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}, {"original_name": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " James", "family": "Baker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of History, Art History and Philosophy, University of Sussex, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sussex", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00ayhx656", "GRID": "grid.12082.39"}}]}, {"given": " James", "family": "Hetherington", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Research Software Development Group, Research IT Services, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " David", "family": "Beavan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Martin", "family": "Zaltz Austwick", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Anne", "family": "Welsh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Helen", "family": "O'Neill", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Studies, University College London, UK, The London Library, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Will", "family": "Finley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of History, University of Sheffield, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sheffield", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05krs5044", "GRID": "grid.11835.3e"}}]}, {"given": " Oliver", "family": "Duke-Williams", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Studies, University College London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Adam", "family": "Farquhar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Scholarship, British Library, UK", "normalized_name": "British Library", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05dhe8b71", "GRID": "grid.36212.34"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-02-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "33", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
