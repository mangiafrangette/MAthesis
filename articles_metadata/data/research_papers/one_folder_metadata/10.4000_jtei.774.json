The systems produced vary considerably, but they all face the issue of sustainability, namely how to ensure the continued existence of a resource once the project that created it has finished. This paper addresses the sustainability issues faced by the TextGrid and TEXTvre virtual research environments for textual scholarship, examining the inter-project collaboration and cross-fertilization that took place, and investigating how the projects benefited from this exchange. It also examines how their sustainability is being facilitated by the more general-purpose DARIAH infrastructure, and conversely how their existing collaboration can serve as a model for future collaborations within the DARIAH community.", "article_title": "TextGrid, TEXTvre, and DARIAH: Sustainability of Infrastructures for Textual Scholarship", "authors": [{"given": "Mark", "family": "Hedges", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Heike", "family": "Neuroth", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Göttingen State and University Library (SUB) in Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Kathleen M.", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Göttingen State and University Library", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Tobias", "family": "Blanke", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for e-Research, Department of Digital Humanities, at King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Laurent", "family": "Romary", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "INRIA, Rocquencourt, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany", "normalized_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hcx6992", "GRID": "grid.7468.d"}}]}, {"given": "Marc", "family": "Küster", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fachhochschule Worms, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Malcolm", "family": "Illingworth", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "EPCC, University of Edinburgh", "normalized_name": "University of Edinburgh", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01nrxwf90", "GRID": "grid.4305.2"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 5", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
