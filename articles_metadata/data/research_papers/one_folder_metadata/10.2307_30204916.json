Essays used to train and evaluate the systems were annotated by two human judges, according to a discourse annotation protocol. Using a machine learning approach, a number of discourse-related features were automatically extracted from a set of annotated training data. Using these features, two discourse analysis models were built using C5.0 with boosting: a topic-dependent and a topic-independent model. Both systems outperformed a positional algorithm. While the topic-dependent system showed somewhat higher performance, the topic-independent system showed similar results, indicating that a system can generalize to unseen data - that is, essay responses on topics that the system has not seen in training.", "article_title": "A Machine Learning Approach for Identification of Thesis and Conclusion Statements in Student Essays", "authors": [{"given": "Jill", "family": "Burstein", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ 08541, USA", "normalized_name": "Educational Testing Service", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03b5q4637", "GRID": "grid.286674.9"}}]}, {"given": "Daniel", "family": "Marcu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Southern California/Information Sciences Institute, 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001", "normalized_name": "University of Southern California", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03taz7m60", "GRID": "grid.42505.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2003", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "37", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
