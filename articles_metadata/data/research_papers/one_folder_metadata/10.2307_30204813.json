This serves to set WSD apart and puts limits on its effectiveness as an independent NLP task. Moreover, it is argued that current WSD methods based on very small word samples are also potentially misleading because they may or may not scale up. Since all-word WSD methods are now available and are producing figures comparable to the smaller scale tasks, it is argued that we should concentrate on the former and find ways of bootstrapping test materials for such tests in the future.", "article_title": "Is Word Sense Disambiguation Just One More NLP Task?", "authors": [{"given": "Yorick", "family": "Wilks", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sheffield", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05krs5044", "GRID": "grid.11835.3e"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
