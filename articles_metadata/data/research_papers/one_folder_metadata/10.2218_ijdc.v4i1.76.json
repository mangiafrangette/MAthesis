This vast amount of information that is either digitized or born-digital needs to be collected, organized and preserved in a way that ensures that our digital assets and the information they carry remain available for future use. Digital curation has emerged as a new inter-disciplinary practice that seeks to set guidelines for disciplined management of information. In this paper we review two recent models for digital curation introduced by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and the Digital Curation Unit (DCU) of the Athena Research Centre. We then propose a fusion of the two models that highlights the need to extend the digital curation lifecycle by adding (a) provisions for the registration of usage experience, (b) a stage for knowledge enhancement and (c) controlled vocabularies used by convention to denote concepts, properties and relations. The objective of the proposed extensions is twofold: (i) to provide a more complete lifecycle model for the digital curation domain; and (ii) to provide a stimulus for a broader discussion on the research agenda.", "article_title": "DCC&U: An Extended Digital Curation Lifecycle Model", "authors": [{"given": "Panos", "family": "Constantopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Costis", "family": "Dallas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Ion", "family": "Androutsopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Stavros", "family": "Angelis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Antonios", "family": "Deligiannakis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Dimitris", "family": "Gavrilis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Yannis", "family": "Kotidis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Christos", "family": "Papatheodorou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athena Research CentreAthens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009-06-29", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
