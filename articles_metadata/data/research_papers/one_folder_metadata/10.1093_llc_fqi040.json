This paper develops a new data structure for variants, suitable for a wider range of texts, which also solves most of the problems associated with the representation of variant data. A prototype applet, which can graphically display the new data structure is described, as also the current state of the editor being developed from it.", "article_title": "Graphical Editor for Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": " Desmond", "family": "Schmidt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Queensland", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00rqy9422", "GRID": "grid.1003.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2005-09-16", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "21", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
