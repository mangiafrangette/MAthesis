First year experience abroad offers opportunities for students to explore a study abroad topic in depth at an early point in their academic career. Recently, significant numbers of faculty have begun to lead study abroad groups on the Camino de Santiago in Spain. Due to the increasing popularity of walking the Camino overall, overcrowding and other related issues are becoming a problem. I propose that faculty leading student groups on the Camino incorporate digital mapping tools as part of the curriculum to increase awareness among students about the potential impact they may have on local communities. Furthermore, the use of digital mapping tools to either complement or replace the more traditionally assigned journal will help the student meet the desired learning outcomes set forth by the first year experience abroad programâ€”develop, experience and reflect. By understanding spatial relationships, students will ask questions and make connections that they otherwise would not have.
