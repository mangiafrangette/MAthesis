The strength of the external evidence depends on the authority of that collection; it is shakier than its editor claimed. Internal evidence comes from a Goldsmith ‘profile’ of stylistic features, established by reference to contemporary essayists, from measures of sentence-length, distinctive features of the attributed essays, and parallels of word and thought. We conclude that most of the attributed essays, including those proposed since 1798, are unlikely to be Goldsmith's.", "article_title": "Goldsmith and the 'British Magazine': A reconsideration", "authors": [{"given": " Peter", "family": "Dixon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": " David", "family": "Mannion", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Royal Holloway, University of London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "25", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
