In this paper these components are isolated using graphical techniques. Combining batches of different types of sentence that are conceived at different scale levels also modifies the distribution. The effect of these variables is to give the sentence length distribution curve of each work of literature a unique profile. In longer composite texts, these variables average out and the curves converge on an ultimate distribution curve.", "article_title": "Graphical Analysis of the Sentence Length Distribution Curve and Non-rational Components", "authors": [{"given": " George K.", "family": "Barr", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ComrieUK", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
