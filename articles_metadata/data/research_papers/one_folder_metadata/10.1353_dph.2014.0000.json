In it the author explores the potential advantages and practical limitations, as well as existing models of transnational resources—such as the Friedberg Genizah Project and the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts, as well as del Barco and Vegas Montaner’s project of cataloguing the Hebrew manuscripts in Spanish libraries—that could be considered when thinking of what form a Sephardic archive could take. This study also explores how issues of language and identity fare when translated into the metadata used to make digitized information available.", "article_title": "The Sephardic Past in the Digital Future", "authors": [{"given": "Michelle M.", "family": "Hamilton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Minnesota, Twin Cities", "normalized_name": "University of Minnesota", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017zqws13", "GRID": "grid.17635.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
