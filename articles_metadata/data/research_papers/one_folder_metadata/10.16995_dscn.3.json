After that and taking current research on past (printed) books as an analogy, I shall try to outline which kinds of (digital) material will be indispensable in the future to do research on today's digital book production: published digital materials and unique (digital) artefacts. Finally, I shall present the results of my exemplary studies to find out which precautions for the future availability of digital material have been taken by various (German) institutions involved in the production of digital forms of books (typically publishers) as well as by public institutions, the mandate of which is to collect and secure future access to current books and unique artefacts (typically libraries and archives). Summarizing, I will expose what this could mean for future research on today´s ebooks--and for the requirements concerning ebook preservation measures and policies.", "article_title": "Chapter 4Will our children have the chance to do research on today’s digital books?", "authors": [{"given": "Christoph", "family": "Bläsi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Johannes Gutenberg University", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "6", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
