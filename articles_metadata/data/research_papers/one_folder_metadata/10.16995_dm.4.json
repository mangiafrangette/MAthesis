Working with a small corpus of Tuscan manuscripts from the tenth- through twelfth-century now owned by the Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati in Siena, the article shows how the software can be used to characterise the calligraphic ideal for each script in a given manuscript, compare letterforms in different scribes’ work, and define relationships among individual scripts and manuscripts.The article concludes with a discussion of potential improvements for the SPI system.", "article_title": "Digital palaeography: using the digital representation of medieval script to support palaeographic analysis", "authors": [{"given": "Arianna", "family": "Ciula", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King’s College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}, {"original_name": "Universita' degli Studi di Siena", "normalized_name": "University of Siena", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tevnk56", "GRID": "grid.9024.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2005", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "1", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.4"}
