These letters fit into the ‘Lost Cause’ literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There are, however, anachronisms and other factual problems in the published letters, and they have been questioned, at least in part, by writers and historians of the Civil War. Other historians believe them to be essentially genuine. This paper conducts a stylometric investigation of the Pickett Letters as a complement to traditional historical research. Our investigation strongly suggests that Pickett's widow, LaSalle Corbell Pickett, did compose the published letters. Eleven handwritten letters are, however, thought to be from George's hand.", "article_title": "A Widow and her Soldier: Stylometry and the American Civil War", "authors": [{"given": " David I.", "family": "Holmes", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The College of New JerseyUSA", "normalized_name": "Princeton University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hx57361", "GRID": "grid.16750.35"}}]}, {"given": " Lesley J.", "family": "Gordon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of AkronUSA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Christine", "family": "Wilson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The College of New JerseyUSA", "normalized_name": "Princeton University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hx57361", "GRID": "grid.16750.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
