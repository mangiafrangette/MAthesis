The relational database, another well-established method of encoding information, suggests another definition of text, not as a hierarchical structure but as a \"labelled network of language objects.\" This alternative model allows text not only to be stored in a database but also encoded as a database. Some applications of this model are illustrated from our current work with Glyphicus, a database-building tool that we are using to encode the Middle English long poem Sir Perceval of Galles.", "article_title": "A Relational Database Model for Text Encoding", "authors": [{"given": "Yin", "family": "Liu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}, {"given": "Jeff", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": ["relational databases, text encoding, text modelling, markup, XML"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
