This essay investigates what made the tale so gripping to its medieval readers and translators: its uncoupling of knowledge from mastery. I use Deleuze's and DeLanda's discussions of assemblage theory to consider how Arabic versions of the tale link heterogeneous fields and genres of knowledge into a fantasy of feminine, enslaved omnicompetence, and also how the tales' global transmigrations create a network of multifaceted and larger-than-Eurocentric research, informed but not deliminated by colonialism and decolonization.", "article_title": "Tawaddud/Teodor and the Stripping of Medieval Mastery", "authors": [{"given": "Christine", "family": "Chism", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, Los Angeles", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
