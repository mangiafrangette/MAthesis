These communications between the federal government and frontier settlers comprise the actual discourse of the nationâ€™s expansion over six decades. Digitizing the Territorial Papers permits the possibility of analyzing the entire corpus globally. Text mining and topic modeling methods give us a lens on the language patterns through which new state governments and the expanding nation were formed. An initial statistical analysis of the textual information provides a visualization of content, helps discern how ideals about governance emerged, and lays the foundation for developing more sophisticated hypotheses and theoretical constructs.", "article_title": "A case study in text mining: Textual analysis of the Territorial Papers", "authors": [{"given": " Johannes", "family": "Ledolter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tippie College of Business, University of Iowa, IA, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Iowa", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/036jqmy94", "GRID": "grid.214572.7"}}]}, {"given": " Lea", "family": "VanderVelde", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "College of Law, University of Iowa, IA, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Iowa", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/036jqmy94", "GRID": "grid.214572.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019-01-18", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
