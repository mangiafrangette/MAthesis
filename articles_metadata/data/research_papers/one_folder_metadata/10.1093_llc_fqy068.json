This lack of research has inspired the authors to conduct a long-term research project, focusing on musical and linguistic aspects of music played during cremations. This article presents the analysis of a playlist consisting of twenty-five sets of music, each consisting of three tracks, used in a crematorium in the south of The Netherlands from 1986 onward. The main objective is to identify the differences and similarities of the twenty-five sets of musical tracks regarding content and musical properties. Consequently, we aim to provide insight in the history of (music played during) cremation rituals in The Netherlands. To analyze the musical properties of the sets, the authors use both a qualitative approach (close reading and musical analysis) and a computational analysis approach. The article demonstrates that a combination of a close reading and musical analysis and a computational analysis is necessary to explain the differences in properties of the sets. The presented multi-method approach may allow for comparisons against musical preferences in the context of current cremations, which makes it possible to trace the development of music and cremation rituals.", "article_title": "Music and cremation rituals in The Netherlands: A fine-grained analysis of a crematoriumâ€™s playlist", "authors": [{"given": " Doris", "family": "van der Smissen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences, Tilburg University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Tilburg University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04b8v1s79", "GRID": "grid.12295.3d"}}]}, {"given": " Margaret A", "family": "Steenbakker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences, Tilburg University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Tilburg University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04b8v1s79", "GRID": "grid.12295.3d"}}]}, {"given": " Martin J M", "family": "Hoondert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences, Tilburg University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Tilburg University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04b8v1s79", "GRID": "grid.12295.3d"}}]}, {"given": " Menno M", "family": "van Zaanen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences, Tilburg University, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Tilburg University", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04b8v1s79", "GRID": "grid.12295.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
