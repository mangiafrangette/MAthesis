The use of sets of related syntactic frames and verb classes are examined as a means of simplifying the task of defining different senses, and the importance of concrete criteria such as different predicate argument structures, semantic class constraints and lexical co-occurrences is emphasized.", "article_title": "Consistent Criteria for Sense Distinctions", "authors": [{"given": "Martha", "family": "Palmer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, IRCS, University of Pennsylvania, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00b30xv10", "GRID": "grid.25879.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
