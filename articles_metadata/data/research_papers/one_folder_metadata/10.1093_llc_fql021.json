Using Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury as our primary text case, we outline the features and rationale of our collaborative framework, called Callimachus. We present our findings concerning that text and explore how these findings only became possible after breaking with the received wisdom concerning the application of XML and the Text Encoding Initiative to such analytical projects.", "article_title": "Callimachusâ€”Avoiding the Pitfalls of XML for Collaborative Text Analysis", "authors": [{"given": " Jeff", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}, {"given": " Joel", "family": "Deshaye", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}, {"given": " Peter", "family": "Stoicheff", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2006", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "21", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
