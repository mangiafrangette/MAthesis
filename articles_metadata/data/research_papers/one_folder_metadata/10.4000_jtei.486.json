We describe a combination of open-source tools and an open-access approach to creating knowledge repositories that have been employed in building a bibliographic reference library for the “TEI for Linguists” special interest group (LingSIG). The authors argue that, for an initiative such as the TEI, it is important to choose open, freely available solutions. If these solutions have the advantage of attracting new users and promoting the initiative itself, so much the better, especially if it is done in a non-committal way: no one using the LingSIG bibliographic repository has to be a member of the LingSIG or a “TEI-er” in general.", "article_title": "Building and Maintaining the TEI LingSIG Bibliography", "authors": [{"given": "Piotr", "family": "Bański", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Warsaw", "normalized_name": "University of Warsaw", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/039bjqg32", "GRID": "grid.12847.38"}}, {"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Sprache in Mannheim", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Stefan", "family": "Majewski", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}, {"original_name": "Göttingen State and University Library", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Maik", "family": "Stührenberg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Sprache (IDS, Institute for the German Language) in Mannheim", "normalized_name": "Institute for the German Language", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hvwkt50", "GRID": "grid.443960.c"}}]}, {"given": "Antonina", "family": "Werthmann", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Sprache (IDS, Institute for the German Language) in Mannheim", "normalized_name": "Institute for the German Language", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hvwkt50", "GRID": "grid.443960.c"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
