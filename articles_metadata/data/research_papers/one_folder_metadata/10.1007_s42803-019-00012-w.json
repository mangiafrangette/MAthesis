Variants are liberated from their peripheral place in appendices or footnotes and are given a more prominent position in the (digital) edition of a work. But what constitutes an informative and meaningful visualisation of textual variation? The present article takes visualisation of the result of collation software as point of departure, examining several visualisations of collation output that contains a wealth of information about textual variance. The newly developed collation software HyperCollate is used as a touchstone to study the issue of representing textual information to advance literary research. The article concludes with a set of recommendations in order to evaluate different visualisations of collation output.", "article_title": "From graveyard to graph", "authors": [{"given": "Elli", "family": "Bleeker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Research and Development – KNAW Humanities Cluster, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Bram", "family": "Buitendijk", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Research and Development – KNAW Humanities Cluster, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Ronald", "family": "Haentjens Dekker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Research and Development – KNAW Humanities Cluster, Amsterdam, Netherlands", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
