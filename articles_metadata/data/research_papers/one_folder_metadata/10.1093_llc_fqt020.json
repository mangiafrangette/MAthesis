Oakes and Farrow (2007) proposed various adaptations of this test to allow for the simultaneous comparison of more than two corpora while also yielding an almost correct Type I error rate (i.e. claiming that a word is most frequently found in a variety of English, when in actuality this is not the case). By means of resampling procedures, the present study shows that when used in this context, the chi-squared test produces far too many significant results, even in its modified version. Several potential approaches to circumventing this problem are discussed in the conclusion.", "article_title": "Inadequacy of the chi-squared test to examine vocabulary differences between corpora", "authors": [{"given": " Yves", "family": "Bestgen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium", "normalized_name": "Université Catholique de Louvain", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02495e989", "GRID": "grid.7942.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013-04-16", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
