This paper poses a method for collecting and analyzing these new visual elements and incorporating the results of that study into the study of presidential Rhetoric. This article will: (1) situate the enhanced State of the Union within the study of presidential rhetoric, (2) combine aspects of close and distant reading for critique of the address, (3) provide the results of the approach to distant reading taken here, and (4) discuss the implications of the analysis of this particular visual program as they afford future annual addresses different opportunities, and constraints.
