But instead of enumerating or summarizing them, this introduction is meant as a reflection on some of the possible ways in which our work in digital scholarly editing could be useful to the broader field of digital humanities. After all, we tend to work on a microscale compared to the forms of macroanalysis and ‘distant’ reading that are currently dominant in digital literary studies. This raises the question: how can our research be relevant to these other sub-disciplines in digital humanities?", "article_title": "Artificial imagination, imagine: new developments in digital scholarly editing", "authors": [{"given": "Dirk", "family": "Van Hulle", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Literature, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019-04-25", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
