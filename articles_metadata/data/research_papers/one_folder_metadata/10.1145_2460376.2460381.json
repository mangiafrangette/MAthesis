The aim of this work is to improve the learning experience by enhancing the immersiveness felt by the player. The system is implemented in a Service Oriented Architecture perspective and it exposes its functionalities through Web services. It also provides an easy to use authoring tool, which allows cultural heritage experts to define the character's knowledge without the need for learning a scripting language. We tested the system by embedding it in a simple serious game, where the user could interact with the virtual representation of a XVI century Geneoese artist, Luca Cambiaso, in order to acquire knowledge about his life and artworks. These early lab test results showed a high level of appreciation for the usability of the system and for the user engagement. Tests also showed that the system is a good didactic tool, since players demonstrated a similar level of knowledge acquisition to that achieved by reading a text.", "article_title": "An easy to author dialogue management system for serious games", "authors": [{"given": "Daniele", "family": "Mori", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Genoa, Genova, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Genoa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0107c5v14", "GRID": "grid.5606.5"}}]}, {"given": "Riccardo", "family": "Berta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Genoa, Genova, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Genoa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0107c5v14", "GRID": "grid.5606.5"}}]}, {"given": "Alessandro", "family": "De Gloria", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Genoa, Genova, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Genoa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0107c5v14", "GRID": "grid.5606.5"}}]}, {"given": "Valentina", "family": "Fiore", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Genoa, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Genoa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0107c5v14", "GRID": "grid.5606.5"}}]}, {"given": "Lauto", "family": "Magnani", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Genoa, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Genoa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0107c5v14", "GRID": "grid.5606.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
