In particular, we describe our exploration of the potential role of an ontology in facilitating the interpretation of implicit and hidden associations in the sources of interest, examining its use, and limits in a digital humanities project in connection with editing tools and delivery issues. We demonstrate our findings based on the Henry III Fine Rolls project, where an ontology—built using the RDF (Resource Description Framework)/OWL (Web Ontology Language) technologies—is being developed to make explicit information about person, place, and subject entities marked up as instances in the core texts themselves. For any historian, there is a natural tension between primary sources (as documentary records) and the analysis that produces a context for interpretation. We will argue that the combination of core mark-up (encoded in TEI) and an ontology (in RDF/OWL) provides a powerful model for representing the complexity of this tension and facilitates the necessarily dynamic process of scholarly interpretation.", "article_title": "Expressing complex associations in medieval historical documents: the Henry III Fine Rolls Project", "authors": [{"given": " Arianna", "family": "Ciula", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": " Paul", "family": "Spence", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": " José Miguel", "family": "Vieira", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
