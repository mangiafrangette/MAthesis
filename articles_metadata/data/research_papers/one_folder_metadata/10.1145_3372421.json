However, we have detected a lack in the area of interactive cultural heritage applications, where speed and plausibility are the main requirements to satisfy. We designed a tool that allows setting up and recreating earthquakes in a simple way. We coupled our earthquake simulator with a structural simulator of physics, specifically tailored to masonry buildings, achieving a high degree of accuracy in the simulations. To validate our model, we performed a series of tests over a set of ancient masonry structures such as walls and churches. We show the feasibility of including earthquake simulations and structural vulnerability, a building property that limits the damage of this under seismic movements, into historical studies for helping professionals understand those events of the past where an earthquake took place.", "article_title": "Earthquake Simulation on Ancient Masonry Buildings", "authors": [{"given": "Josep Lluis", "family": "Fita", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Girona Spain, Girona, Spain", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Gonzalo", "family": "Besuievsky", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Girona Spain, Girona, Spain", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Gustavo", "family": "Patow", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Girona Spain, Girona, Spain", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2020-05-31", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "13", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
