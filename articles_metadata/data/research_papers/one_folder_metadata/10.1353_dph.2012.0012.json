The article foregrounds the existence of different versions of Nítíða saga by considering the differences between this version of the text and the better-known version from earlier manuscripts. In addition, this article offers an explanation for two scribal errors in one version of the saga through comparison with the other, and shows the importance of further manuscript-based research of this sort in Icelandic literary studies and other fields.", "article_title": "Variance Uncovered and Errors Explained: An Analysis of Nítíða saga in the Seventeenth-Century Icelandic Manuscript js 166 FOL.", "authors": [{"given": "Sheryl", "family": "McDonald", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Leeds", "normalized_name": "University of Leeds", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024mrxd33", "GRID": "grid.9909.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013-01-06", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
