The British Parliamentary investigations into sea fishing comprise a large body of evidence on the transformation of the trade, the exponential growth of the fish harvest, and the evolving recognition that over-fishing was underway. The use of CAQDA and GIS described in this article explores some 1,800 pages of testimony given by fisherman, scientific experts, and regulatory officials before the Parliamentary commissions of enquiry in 1863–1866 and 1893–1894.
