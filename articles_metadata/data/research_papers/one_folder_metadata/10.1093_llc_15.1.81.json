For a number of problems regularly encountered in the transcription of Old Norse/Icelandic materials, however, the solutions offered by the TEI have not proved entirely satisfactory. A group of scholars from several Scandinavian universities has been working for the last 4 years on a set of recommendations for modifications and extensions to the TEI DTD to be used in the encoding of such material. The present paper discusses some of these recommendations.", "article_title": "Encoding old Norse/Icelandic primary sources using TEI-conformant SGML", "authors": [{"given": "M.", "family": "Driscoll", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Det Arnamagnaenske Institut, Njalsgade 76, DK-2300 Kobenhavn S, Denmark E-mail: mjd@hum.ku.dk ", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
