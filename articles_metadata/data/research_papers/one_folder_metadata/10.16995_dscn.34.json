The project is the first Italian Alternate Reality Game (ARG) dedicated to Leonardo Da Vinci and is aimed at promoting the territory of Lomellina adopting innovative communication strategies to engage players in a game which is designed to amuse and encourage tourism. The transmedia and the locative experience were designed by a team of researchers from the Politecnico di Torino and Guglielmo Marconi University. Starting from the analysis of the Aequilibrium project, this essay focuses on how alternate reality games can promote participation in cultural experiences which offer cultural activators fostering collaboration and creative grassroots production within communities of players.", "article_title": "Alternate Reality Game and Culural Heritage: The “Aequilibrium” Project", "authors": [{"given": "Domenico", "family": "Morreale", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of sociological and psycho-pedagogical studies, Guglielmo Marconi University, Rome", "normalized_name": "Marconi University", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00j0rk173", "GRID": "grid.440899.8"}}]}, {"given": "Giulia", "family": "Bertone", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "DIST - Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies And Planning, Politecnico Di Torino", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "0", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
