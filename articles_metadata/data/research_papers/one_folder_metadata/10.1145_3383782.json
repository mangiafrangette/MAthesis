The tablet is covered with engraved inscriptions on both sides and includes a musical score. Digitization allowed for an advanced analysis of the inscriptions, and to generate a complete and precise 3D model of the artifact that was used to produce an interactive application deployed both on tactile tablets and websites. The interactive application integrates a musical interpretation of the score that gives access to a testimony of intangible heritage. This interdisciplinary work gathered archaeologists, researchers from computer science and physics, and a professional musician.", "article_title": "From the Engraved Tablet to the Digital Tablet, History of a 15th-Century Music Score", "authors": [{"given": "Ronan", "family": "Gaugne", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Françoise", "family": "Labaune", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Inrap, UMR 6566 CReAAH", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Dominique", "family": "Fontaine", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Independent professional singer", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Gaétan Le", "family": "Cloirec", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Inrap, UMR 6566 CReAAH", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Valérie", "family": "Gouranton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Univ Rennes, INSA Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2020", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "13", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
