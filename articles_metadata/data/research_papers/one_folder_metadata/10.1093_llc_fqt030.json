This response will summarize the article’s methodology and conclusion, arguing that while Redfern finds that films are not ‘perfectly’ lognormal, this is hardly evidence worthy of the ultimate conclusion that a lognormal fit is ‘inappropriate’. Perfection is fleeting, and cannot be expected when modeling real data. Reanalysis of Redfern’s methodology and findings shows that the lognormal distribution offers a pretty good fit.", "article_title": "Horseshoes, handgrenades, and model fitting: the lognormal distribution is a pretty good model for shot-length distribution of Hollywood films", "authors": [{"given": " Jordan", "family": "DeLong", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cornell University, USA", "normalized_name": "Cornell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bnh6r87", "GRID": "grid.5386.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013-06-19", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "30", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
