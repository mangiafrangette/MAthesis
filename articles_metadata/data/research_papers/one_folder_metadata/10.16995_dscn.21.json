Artistry now lies in how pre-existing materials are remixed and rendered new; it is through acts of transformation of the original that the remix's value is found. Artists reuse other works to reveal or transmit political messages, and not simply to re-create them. The remix is not killing narrative but instead is fostering a transformation and renaissance of creative practice, outside of the legal boundaries of copyright. The criminalization of new kinds of creative practice is a growing barrier to the remix's creative renaissance. Remix reimagines pre-existing texts, plots and genres as a way of interrogating the future of culture, via digital collaborative authorship and a distinct remix aesthetic of interruption, disturbance, and capture/leakage.", "article_title": "\"It’s Creativity, Jim, but not as we know it\": Authorship in the Age of the Remix.", "authors": [{"given": "Carolyn", "family": "Guertin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Augmented Reality Lab, York University, Toronto", "normalized_name": "York University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fq50484", "GRID": "grid.21100.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
