Popular songs are a good representation of modern culture and society. Songs by female singer-songwriters account for a large portion of the current Japanese hit charts and particularly play an important role in understanding the Japanese language and communication style. In this study, we applied new methods of computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs. The results clearly show differences in the characteristics of 10 female singer-songwriters, and we found that the visualization of the lyrics is a typical characteristic of current singer-songwriters. Our findings provide an important case study for computational stylistics and can also be useful for understanding Japanese cultural trends.
