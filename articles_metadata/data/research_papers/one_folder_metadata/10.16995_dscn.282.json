We explore the notion of the software prototype within the discussion of making and building in digital humanities. The backdrop for our discussion is a collaboration between project team members from computer science and literature that resulted in a tool named TopoText that was built to geocode locations within an unstructured text and to perform some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks about the context of those locations. In the interest of collaborating more effectively with increasingly larger and more multidisciplinary research communities, we move outward from that specific collaboration to explore one of the ways that such research is characterized in the domain of software engineering—the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard. Although not a perfect fit with discourses of value in the humanities, it provides a possible starting point for forging shared vocabularies within the research collaboratory. In particular, we focus on a subset of characteristics outlined by the standard and attempt to translate them into terms generative of further discussion in the digital humanities community.", "article_title": "Prototyping Across the Disciplines", "authors": [{"given": "Randa", "family": "El Khatib", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "David Joseph", "family": "Wrisley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "New York University Abu Dhabi", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Shady", "family": "Elbassuoni", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "American University of Beirut", "normalized_name": "American University of Beirut", "country": "Lebanon", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pznsd21", "GRID": "grid.22903.3a"}}]}, {"given": "Mohamad", "family": "Jaber", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "American University of Beirut", "normalized_name": "American University of Beirut", "country": "Lebanon", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pznsd21", "GRID": "grid.22903.3a"}}]}, {"given": "Julia", "family": "El Zini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "American University of Beirut", "normalized_name": "American University of Beirut", "country": "Lebanon", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04pznsd21", "GRID": "grid.22903.3a"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019-01-03", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
