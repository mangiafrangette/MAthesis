Although it is based on the consensus of a large community, it does not have the legal status of a standard. During the last decade, efforts have been undertaken to develop definitive de jure standards for linguistic data that not only act as a normative basis for the exchange of language corpora but also address recent advancements in technology, such as web-based standards, and the use of large and multiply annotated corpora.", "article_title": "The TEI and Current Standards for Structuring Linguistic Data", "authors": [{"given": "Maik", "family": "St√ºhrenberg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bielefeld University", "normalized_name": "Bielefeld University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02hpadn98", "GRID": "grid.7491.b"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012-11-06", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
