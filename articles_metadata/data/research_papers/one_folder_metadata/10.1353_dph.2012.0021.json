The project calls attention to and increases understanding of Carolingian monastic life at one of the great houses of the time. Whether the library was ever intended to be constructed or whether it was an imaginative conceptualization of an ideal library is immaterial to the light the project has shed on Carolingian spirituality. This article both introduces the project and demonstrates how digitization of manuscripts can increase the data available for studying devotion and the religious emotions that it entailed.", "article_title": "Digital Devotion from Carolingian Reichenau and St. Gall", "authors": [{"given": "Richard Matthew", "family": "Pollard", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of British Columbia", "normalized_name": "University of British Columbia", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rmrcq20", "GRID": "grid.17091.3e"}}]}, {"given": "Julian", "family": "Hendrix", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Carthage College", "normalized_name": "Carthage College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00wkay776", "GRID": "grid.420456.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
