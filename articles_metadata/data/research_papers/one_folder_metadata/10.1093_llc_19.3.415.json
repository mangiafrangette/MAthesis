By 3D scanning the miniatures and enlarging them to life‐size, the project has initiated a programme of practice‐based research in the studio, leading to live performances that are the first to use objectively reconstructed ancient masks. The paper describes the considerations that apply at different stages of the process, from the digitization of the artifact to mask‐construction and performance experimentation.", "article_title": "Digital Resources for Practice-based Research: The New Comedy Masks Project", "authors": [{"given": "R.", "family": "Williams", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "19", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
