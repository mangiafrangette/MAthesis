{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " This essay was written specifically for NYCDHWeek 2018, the theme of which was DH in the Moment: Reaction, Response, Relevance. The author examines how we define digital humanities activism and how we frame its histories. Relying primarily on examples from Caribbean-oriented digital work, the author argues for a broad definition of DH activism that allows for a variety of projects and intended audiences. In particular, the essay responds to the tendency to focus on DH in the moment (projects that can be done quickly and yield a high social impact) as the primary form of activism, arguing that alongside such projects we include as activist projects that have a more cumulative and less immediate effect. Recently, we have begun to ask not just what the digital humanities does, but what the digital humanities does for others. This essay considers why it is that this has become a key question in this DH moment.
