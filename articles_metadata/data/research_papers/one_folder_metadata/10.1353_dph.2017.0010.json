This article discusses the workflows and technologies of both projects with a focus on the potential and limits of machine-reading technologies.", "article_title": "Automatic Layout Analysis and Storage of Digitized Medieval Books", "authors": [{"given": "Hannah", "family": "Busch", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universität Trier", "normalized_name": "University of Trier", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02778hg05", "GRID": "grid.12391.38"}}]}, {"given": "Philipp", "family": "Hegel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Technische Universität Darmstadt", "normalized_name": "TU Darmstadt", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05n911h24", "GRID": "grid.6546.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
