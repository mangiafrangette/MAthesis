{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Recent years have seen widespread interest in digital humanities (DH) and growing interest in undergraduate-centered digital curricula. However, few undergraduate DH programs resemble those at large research institutions, where digital initiatives tend to be housed in graduate programs and rooted in graduate pedagogy or faculty research. Further, no two undergraduate DH programs are alike. This article seeks to move beyond graduate- and faculty-centered models by exploring new possibilities for undergraduate DH initiatives. It describes a workshop held at the ADHO DH2015 conference. This workshop brought together practitioners of digital pedagogy from small liberal arts colleges and from undergraduate centers within larger institutions. This article details the workshopâ€™s exploration of undergraduate DH education, situating those practices in the context of broader trends in digital pedagogy. Finally, this article charts three broad challenges faced by programs which emphasize undergraduate digital curricula and offers suggestions and strategies to address these common issues.
