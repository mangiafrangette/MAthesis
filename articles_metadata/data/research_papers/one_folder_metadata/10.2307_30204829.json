The use of cartographic data is especially useful in research dealing with the spatial distribution of various phenomena. The spatial distribution of rural social strata is one such phenomenon that has not yet received much attention. The case study of Pischelsdorf, an Austrian settlement, in the beginning of the nineteenth century shall serve as an example for such research. Pischelsdorf is situated in the Austrian province of Styria, about 150 km from Vienna, and served as a small centre for trade and handicraft for the surrounding villages. This study is based on the land register of 1822 which has been digitised.", "article_title": "Spatial Distribution of Rural Social Strata: Using Digitised Maps in Historical Research", "authors": [{"given": "Siegfried", "family": "Gruber", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": "University of Graz", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01faaaf77", "GRID": "grid.5110.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
