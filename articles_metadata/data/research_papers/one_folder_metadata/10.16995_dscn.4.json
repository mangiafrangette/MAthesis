My contention is that critiques offered by scholars such as Jerome McGann can be answered in part by modifying one's conception of the text's poietic frame. If the entire process of editing is conceived of as an autopoietic system, the act of marking the text according to the TEI standards becomes but one stage of a process that is repeatedly questioned and open to revision. By conceiving of the system as editorial interaction with successive iterations of the text, the editor is made aware of the inherent textual and linguistic ambiguities of the source document and is forced to read actively and engage these ambiguities in pursuit of an adequate electronic text. These ideas will be demonstrated with examples from my work in digitizing a manuscript of records belonging to William Courten, a 17th-century naturalist and collector.", "article_title": "Chapter 5Digital editing as autopoietic process", "authors": [{"given": "Jon", "family": "DeTombe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Queen’s University", "normalized_name": "Queen's University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02y72wh86", "GRID": "grid.410356.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2016", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "6", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
