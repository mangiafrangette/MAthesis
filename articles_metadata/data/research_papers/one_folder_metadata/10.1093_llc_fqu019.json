We begin by presenting an overview of bibliometric analysis, noting several barriers to applying this method in the humanities. Following that, we present an experimental tool for extracting and classifying citation contexts in humanities journal articles. This tool reports the bibliographic information about each reference, as well as three features about its context(s): frequency, location-in-document, and polarity. We found that extraction was highly successful (above 85%) for three of the four journals, and statistics for the three citation figures were broadly consistent with previous research. We conclude by noting several limitations of the sentiment classifier and suggesting future areas for refinement.", "article_title": "Citations, contexts, and humanistic discourse: Toward automatic extraction and classification", "authors": [{"given": " Chris Alen", "family": "Sula", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information & Library Science, Pratt Institute, New York, NY, USA", "normalized_name": "Pratt Institute", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/007m3p006", "GRID": "grid.262107.0"}}]}, {"given": " Matthew", "family": "Miller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "NYPL Labs, New York Public Library, New York, NY, USA", "normalized_name": "New York Public Library", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02eysy271", "GRID": "grid.429888.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
