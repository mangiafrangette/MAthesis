Female legislators’ speeches demonstrated characteristics of both a feminine language style (e.g. more use of emotion words, fewer articles) and a masculine one (e.g. more nouns and long words, fewer personal pronouns). A trend analysis found that these gender differences have consistently existed in the Congressional speeches over the past 20 years, regardless of the topic of debate. The findings lend support to the argument that gender differences in language use persist in professional settings like the floor of Congress.", "article_title": "Language and gender in Congressional speech", "authors": [{"given": " Bei", "family": "Yu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Syracuse University, USA", "normalized_name": "Syracuse University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/025r5qe02", "GRID": "grid.264484.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
