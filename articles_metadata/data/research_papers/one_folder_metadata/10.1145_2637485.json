The installation was built for the Maritime Museum in Kotka, Finland, and is part of the preservation efforts of the wreck, which still remains underwater. In addition to the cultural heritage aspect, the project was an experiment in holistic user-centered design, where several design methods, such as scenarios, role playing and informance, storyboards, and prototyping, were employed throughout the process in order to envision the final product as well as assess their utility in the scope of immersive installations. The approach we have taken and documented here can be used as a starting point for similar projects where archaeological sites are reconstructed virtually and presented, for example, in a museum setting.", "article_title": "A Holistic User-Centered Approach to Immersive Digital Cultural Heritage Installations", "authors": [{"given": "Markku", "family": "Reunanen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Espoo, Finland", "normalized_name": "Aalto University", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/020hwjq30", "GRID": "grid.5373.2"}}]}, {"given": "Lily", "family": "DÃ­az", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Espoo, Finland", "normalized_name": "Aalto University", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/020hwjq30", "GRID": "grid.5373.2"}}]}, {"given": "Tommi", "family": "Horttana", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Espoo, Finland", "normalized_name": "Aalto University", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/020hwjq30", "GRID": "grid.5373.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "7", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
