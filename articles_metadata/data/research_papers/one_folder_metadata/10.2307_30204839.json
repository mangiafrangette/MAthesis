This paper describes a manner of representing melodies through a hierarchical structure of elaboration, derived from concepts common in music theory (in particular, the concept of reduction found in the work of Schenker and of Lerdahl & Jackendoff). The fundamental structure is a planar directed acyclic graph, each node of which represents a musical note (not necessarily as it is present in the actual melody) and an elaboration which generates that note on the basis of two parents. These graph structures can be converted to trees, aiding processing and comparison, in two ways. Firstly, any graph can be transformed into a set of binary trees in which each node represents an interval between two notes and an elaboration of that interval. Secondly, in the planar graph, the link of a node to one of its parents often provides no useful information and can be disregarded, resulting in a reduction of the graph tending towards a set of trees. From this arises a new approach to the question of melodic segmentation. Examples of melodic fragments represented in this manner demonstrate how the representation makes explicit similarities between fragments which would not be found by an approach using sequences of features.", "article_title": "Representing Melodic Patterns as Networks of Elaborations", "authors": [{"given": "Alan", "family": "Marsden", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Music Department, Lancaster University", "normalized_name": "Lancaster University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04f2nsd36", "GRID": "grid.9835.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
