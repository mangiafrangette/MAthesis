This article explores that activity by focusing on the process of recording a damaged early medieval inscribed high cross shaft at Toureen Peacaun, Co. Tipperary, Ireland. Revisualising the monument is only one aspect of the scholarly process. Renewed interpretations of cultural heritage objects in digital media provide many answers but also stimulate further challenges for humanities computing, notably, how to address the non-machine readable elements of cultural heritage data.
