One of the aims of a biographical research is to transform the texts of already digitized encyclopaedias (e.g. the Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815–1950, ÖBL, which consists of structured and unstructured data) to a machine readable format, and to perform network-, statistical- and computational linguistic analysis on the transformed data. The biographical research of ÖBL started in 2015 in the Institute for Modern and Contemporary Historical Research [Institut für Neuzeit- und Zeitgeschichtsforschung (INZ)] of the Austrian Academy of Sciences within the project Mapping historical networks: Building the new Austrian Prosopographical, Biographical Information System (APIS). The project is aimed at the digital processing of the ÖBL and the creation of a virtual research environment which is implemented in cooperation with the Austrian Center for Digital Humanities (ACDH) and the Institute for Urban and Regional Research [Institut für Stadt- und Regionalforschung (ISR)]. This paper discusses the technical and natural language processing solutions used in the APIS web application to open up biographical data for the researchers by processing and representing them in a structured format.", "article_title": "Digitisation and Network Research", "authors": [{"given": "Lejtovicz", "family": "Katalin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Schlögl,", "family": "Matthias", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Bernád", "family": "Ágoston Zénó", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Kaiser,", "family": "Maximilian", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Rumpolt,", "family": "Peter Alexander", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE)", "date": "2018-09-14", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digitális Bölcsészet", "volume": "1", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2630-9696", "type": "electronic"}]}
