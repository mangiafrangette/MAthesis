The survey, modelled upon a detailed analysis of 242 projects, recorded 218 complete responses, shedding light on user requirements of digital editions. Specifically, the survey indicates that issues of data reuse, licensing, image availability, and comprehensive documentation are the most requested features of digital editions, although ones which seldom are provided. This analysis feeds into previous studies on good practice in building Digital Humanities resources and puts forward practical recommendations for both creators and funders of digital editions in an effort to promote a stronger consideration of user needs. This survey will be of interest to those who produce digital editions of texts, including developers and engineers, and will also be of interest to those who commission and fund these projects, such as universities, libraries, and archives, whose documentary collections are often showcased in digital editions.", "article_title": "Digital Editions of Text", "authors": [{"given": "Greta", "family": "Franzini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CIRCSE, Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore", "normalized_name": "Catholic University of the Sacred Heart", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03h7r5v07", "GRID": "grid.8142.f"}}]}, {"given": "Melissa", "family": "Terras", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Edinburgh", "normalized_name": "University of Edinburgh", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01nrxwf90", "GRID": "grid.4305.2"}}]}, {"given": "Simon", "family": "Mahony", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Studies, University College London", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "12", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
