With the help of ErMaStat, texts can be analysed with respect to statistical differences, for example in the case of uncertain authorship or if the relative chronology of works of one author is unclear. ErMaStat is the first set of programs in the area of German Medieval Studies which makes it possible to record a large number of different textual features automatically and without any manual input, and subsequently carries out a statistical analysis. The scope of the textual features that can be examined is wide: It ranges from simple quantitative features such as words per line, function words and grammatical phenomena to an automatic analysis of meter. The power of ErMaStat is demonstrated on a number of scholarly issues in German Medieval Literature. It can be shown that the results of the so-called ›schallanalytische Untersuchungen‹ practised by Elisabeth Karg-Gasterstädt are more plausible than hitherto assumed. Another result is that statistical evidence can be presented for the theory that the first thousand lines of Hartmann von Aue's Iwein were written immediately after Hartmann had finished Erec.", "article_title": "TEXTSTATISTISCHE UNTERSUCHUNGEN AN MITTELHOCHDEUTSCHEN TEXTEN", "authors": [{"given": "Friedrich Michael", "family": "Dimpel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg", "normalized_name": "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f7hpc57", "GRID": "grid.5330.5"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
