In this article, we propose such definitions and investigate the impact of our understanding of what correspondence reconstruction is on the production of the DALF formal framework for the transcription of epistolary material. The focus of the paper is on the instruments built into DALF for allowing all types of sorting and classification, hence correspondence reconstruction.", "article_title": "Presentational and Representational Issues in Correspondence Reconstruction and Sorting", "authors": [{"given": "E.", "family": "Vanhoutte", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "19", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
