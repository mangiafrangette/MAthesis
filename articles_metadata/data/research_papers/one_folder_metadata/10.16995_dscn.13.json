This chapter probes the legacy of D.F. McKenzie's notion of 'broken phials' and 'indeterminate texts' using the example of a flagship digital project The Printers' Web undertaken at Wai-te-ata Press, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. It offers an enhanced metacritical understanding of nineteenth century knowledge networks and points to new directions in textual scholarship in the twenty-first century.", "article_title": "Chapter 2At the crossroads: Book history meets digital humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Sydney J.", "family": "Shep", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-10-19", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": "6", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
