The former touches on culture’s relational and participatory value in networks; the latter is related to the effects of this value in the visualisation and canonization of works of art. What is the nature of my appropriation of art when I’m invited to choose works, on a museum’s website, to create “my collection,” “my art gallery,” “my personal museum?” Does this type of invitation favour the democratisation of art knowledge? Or, on the contrary, do these initiatives replicate institutional principles that maintain the prescribing museum’s authority? Does participatory cybermuseology present new issues that result in communal action? Or, alternatively, does it consistently reproduce the traditional canonization process of works of art without permitting a critical reinterpretation? To answer these questions, the theoretical analysis presents proposes layouts, online, of works that originate both from the public domain and from collections from large museums, ranging from the artistic practices of Julia Weist to the Google Art Project.", "article_title": "Muséologie numérique: Action participative en réseau et canonisation selon l’intelligence artificielle", "authors": [{"given": "Christine", "family": "Bernier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0161xgx34", "GRID": "grid.14848.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019-08-09", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
