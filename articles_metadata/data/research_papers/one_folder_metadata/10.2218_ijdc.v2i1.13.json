We have previously proposed dividing features of a document into five types (features for visual layout, language model features, stylometric features, features for semantic structure, and contextual features as an object linked to previously classified objects and other external sources) and have examined visual and language model features. The current paper compares results from testing classifiers based on image and stylometric features in a binary classification to show that certain genres have strong image features which enable effective separation of documents belonging to the genre from a large pool of other documents.", "article_title": "“The Naming of Cats”: Automated Genre Classification", "authors": [{"given": "Yunhyong", "family": "Kim", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Curation Centre (DCC)", "normalized_name": "Digital Curation Centre", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k9d6864", "GRID": "grid.499933.d"}}, {"original_name": "Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Seamus", "family": "Ross", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Curation Centre (DCC)", "normalized_name": "Digital Curation Centre", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k9d6864", "GRID": "grid.499933.d"}}, {"original_name": "Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
