As defined by their principal application in the physical sciences, models are crude, manipulable simplifications whose heuristic power comes both from the insight they give into otherwise inaccessible aspects of the world and from what they fail to capture. They are thus tools for “knowing true things by what their mockeries be”.", "article_title": "‘Knowing true things by what their mockeries be’: Modelling in the Humanities", "authors": [{"given": "Willard", "family": "McCarty", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2003", "keywords": ["modelling, knowledge representation, humanities computing, simulation, philosophy of science, Ovid, , personification"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
