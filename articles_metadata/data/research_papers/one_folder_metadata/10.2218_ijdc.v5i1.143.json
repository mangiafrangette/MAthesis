The German network of expertise in Digital long-term preservation (nestor), in cooperation with the German Institute for Standards (DIN), has undertaken a small study to analyse systematically the relevance and usage of quality management standards for long-term preservation and to filter out the specific standardisation need for digital archives. This paper summarises the results of the study. It gives an overview on the differences in understanding the task “quality management” within different organisations and how they carry out appropriate measures, such as documentation, transparency, adequacy, and measureability in order to demonstrate the trustworthiness of their digital archive.", "article_title": "The Use of Quality Management Standards in Trustworthy Digital Archives", "authors": [{"given": "Susanne", "family": "Dobratz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin", "normalized_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hcx6992", "GRID": "grid.7468.d"}}]}, {"given": "Peter", "family": "Rödig", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universität der Bundeswehr München", "normalized_name": "Bundeswehr University Munich", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05kkv3f82", "GRID": "grid.7752.7"}}, {"original_name": "University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Uwe M.", "family": "Borghoff", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Björn", "family": "Rätzke", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Rätzke IT-Service", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Astrid", "family": "Schoger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bavarian State Library", "normalized_name": "Bavarian State Library", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/031h71w90", "GRID": "grid.432478.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2010", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
