In this article we present the outcome, a computational model for dealing automatically with variant spelling, implemented in an application which we call an ‘Intelligent Archive’. We also reflect on the perspective on Early Modern English, and on the probabilistic aspect of language in general, gained from working through the practical problems which arose in establishing the model.", "article_title": "Old spellings, new methods: automated procedures for indeterminate linguistic data", "authors": [{"given": " Hugh", "family": "Craig", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Literary and Linguistic Computing, School of Humanities and Social Science, The University of Newcastle, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}, {"given": " R.", "family": "Whipp", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Literary and Linguistic Computing, School of Humanities and Social Science, The University of Newcastle, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009-10-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "25", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
