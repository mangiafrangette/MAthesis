This article studies remediation in electronic products in library collections, especially the digital facsimile. Early English Books Online (EEBO) is a particularly interesting example, not only because of its scholarly importance, but also because of its multi-layered genesis from printed work to microfilm (Early English Books (EEB)) to digital (EEBO) facsimile, and to the text encoding initiative EEBO-TCP, a joint ProQuest and Text Creation Partnership (TCP) project. The article analyses the impact of filters and limits of remediation in relation to EEBO and its predecessor EEB, such as the choice to duplicate a single copy of a work as bi-tonal black and white images, and to scholarly work.", "article_title": "Metamorphosis: Remediation in Early English Books Online (EEBO)", "authors": [{"given": " Diana", "family": "Kichuk", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan Library, University of Saskatchewan, Canada", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2007", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "22", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
