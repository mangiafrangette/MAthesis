The Lachmannian terminology allows scholars to classify manuscripts as versions or variants of a work on a purely textual basis, but lacks a rigid designator to indicate a (part of a) manuscript as a unit of text and material considerations. Conversely, scholars who adopt Dagenais’s solution to renounce the work and concentrate on the material scriptum gain a rigid designator, but threaten to lose the ability to classify manuscripts at all. Proceeding from a case study, the article argues that the twelfth-century view of a work’s ontological status enables medievalists to keep classifying their scripta on both textual and material grounds. It explores the possibility of using Dagenais’s scriptum as the foundation for a Neo-Lachmannian terminological framework that allows scholars to study manuscript variance and materiality without losing the ability to classify them.", "article_title": "Work, Version, Text and Scriptum: High Medieval Manuscript Terminology in the Aftermath of the New Philology", "authors": [{"given": "Tjamke", "family": "Snijders", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universiteit Gent", "normalized_name": "Ghent University", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00cv9y106", "GRID": "grid.5342.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "2", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
