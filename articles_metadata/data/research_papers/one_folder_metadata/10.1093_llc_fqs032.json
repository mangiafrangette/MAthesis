Anyway, so far, there is nothing substantially new in this contrast we want to establish between arts and technology: the first ones are always based on some techniques (which are mostly internal to arts) and have constantly tensioned relationships with technologies (which are mostly external to arts). And when I say tensioned relationships, it means that I am trying to understand the distances and rapprochements between arts and technology, without having to choose definitely a possibility or another, as it has often been done by artists, aesthetes, critics, and theorists.", "article_title": "Retard of progress", "authors": [{"given": " Alckmar", "family": "Luiz dos Santos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil CNPq, Brazil", "normalized_name": "Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina", "country": "Brazil", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/041akq887", "GRID": "grid.411237.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "27", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
