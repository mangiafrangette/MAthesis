This paper describes the automatic processing of pronouns in three and a half million words of Bangla corpus data. A corpus-based analysis of Bangla pronouns is developed, and a new approach to the analysis of Bangla pronouns is taken as a consequence. On the basis of this analysis a system is then developed to identify and analyse Bangla pronouns in corpus data.", "article_title": "Bangla pronouns - a corpus based study", "authors": [{"given": " NS", "family": "Dash", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 203, Barrackpore Trunk Road, Calcutta 700035, India E-mail: niladri@www.isical.ac.in ", "normalized_name": "Indian Statistical Institute", "country": "India", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00q2w1j53", "GRID": "grid.39953.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
