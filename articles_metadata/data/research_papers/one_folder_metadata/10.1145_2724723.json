In this framework, a promising approach to captivate the attention of teenagers—a hard to please target audience—is represented by mobile serious games, such as playful activities aiming to primarily fulfil educational purposes. The use of a mobile digital tool during the visit definitely discloses new opportunities for contextual learning scenarios; however, so far, only a few studies have analysed the impact of different communication approaches on visitors’ degree of exploration and acquisition of knowledge. This work aims to enrich this field of research, presenting the conceptual framework; the design principles; and the evaluation results of “Gossip at palace,” a location-based mobile game integrating a storytelling approach. The game was developed for an Italian historical residence to communicate its 18th-century history to teenagers, capitalizing on narrative and game mechanics to foster young visitors’ motivations to explore the museum and facilitate their meaning-making process. Following a mixed-methods perspective, the article firstly describes to what extent the components of the application were appreciated by teenagers as well as by other visitor segments. Secondly, it provides an insight on the effectiveness of the game in facilitating the acquisition of historical knowledge by participants, enriched by considerations on the methods to be adopted when evaluating mobile learning in informal educational settings. Thirdly, players’ degree of use of the digital game throughout the visit is compared to analogous patterns registered for people using a multimedia mobile guide in the same venue. On the one hand, the study pointed out that the game facilitated a wider exploration of the museum; on the other, it highlighted that players mainly gained a superficial knowledge of the proposed contents.", "article_title": "Integrating a Location-Based Mobile Game in the Museum Visit", "authors": [{"given": "Irene", "family": "Rubino", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Politecnico di Torino, Torino (TO), Italy", "normalized_name": "Polytechnic University of Turin", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bgk9508", "GRID": "grid.4800.c"}}]}, {"given": "Claudia", "family": "Barberis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Politecnico di Torino, Torino (TO), Italy", "normalized_name": "Polytechnic University of Turin", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bgk9508", "GRID": "grid.4800.c"}}]}, {"given": "Jetmir", "family": "Xhembulla", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Politecnico di Torino, Torino (TO), Italy", "normalized_name": "Polytechnic University of Turin", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bgk9508", "GRID": "grid.4800.c"}}]}, {"given": "Giovanni", "family": "Malnati", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Politecnico di Torino, Torino (TO), Italy", "normalized_name": "Polytechnic University of Turin", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bgk9508", "GRID": "grid.4800.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "8", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
