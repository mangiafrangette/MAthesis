In short, how should we handle the complex co-presences, imitations, implementations, adaptations and transformations between and among different rule systems, goals, quest structures, tasks, challenges and obstacles, player representations, resources, non-playing characters, game worlds, game engines and platforms etc.? This is the conceptual territory this paper tries to begin to chart by crafting and exploring a general game ecology and its multiple relations to other transmedial modes and entertainment ecologies that also shape and affect individual games.", "article_title": "Explorations in game ecology, part 1", "authors": [{"given": "Markku", "family": "Eskelinen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Helsinki", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch f√ºr Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
