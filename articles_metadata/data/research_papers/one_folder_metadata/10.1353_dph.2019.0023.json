The goal is to better define the intellectual profile of some of the kings, queens, and princes of the House of Aragon, such as James II, Peter III, Martin I, the young Alfonso the Magnanimous, Maria of Castile, and Charles Prince of Viana.", "article_title": "The Books of the Kings of Aragon: From James II to Alfonso IV", "authors": [{"given": "Lluís", "family": "Cabré", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona", "normalized_name": "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052g8jq94", "GRID": "grid.7080.f"}}]}, {"given": "Josep", "family": "Pujol", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona", "normalized_name": "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052g8jq94", "GRID": "grid.7080.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019-10-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
