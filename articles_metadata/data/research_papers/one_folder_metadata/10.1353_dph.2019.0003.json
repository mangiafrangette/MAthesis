The iconography here functions as a vehicle for the global identity of the text, ensuring the permanence of this identity over the process of translation. Henrich Mayer, a German printer and editor in Toulouse, preserved the iconography at the cost of adaptations and significant adjustments in the Castilian Peregrino de la vida humana, which was published in 1490. The editor treated the illustrations as the locus of textual filiation.", "article_title": "Traveling Images: The Illustrations of Guillaume de Deguileville's Livre du Pelerin de vie humaine (Mathis Husz edition, Lyon, 1485) and its Castilian Translation by Vincente de Mazuelo (Heinrich Mayer edition, Toulouse, 1490)", "authors": [{"given": "Philippe", "family": "Maupeu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université Toulouse 2 – Jean Jaurès", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
