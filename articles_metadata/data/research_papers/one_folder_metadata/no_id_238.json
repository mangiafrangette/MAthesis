In this paper we combine perspectives from historical research and literary criticism to problematize the categorization, computation and representation of events in cultural heritage. Combining methodologies of narratology, historic research and Digital Humanities we aim to extract, classify and quantify events in a way that preserves their inherent multiplicity and multivocality. In two case studies we exemplify that narrative may be seen as a means to mediate events rather than a classical media-centred tradition to preserve an authorized version of cultural heritage.
