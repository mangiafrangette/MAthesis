Many of the texts, including Machaut’s poem, appear in the compendium in anonymous and abridged versions that erase details pertaining to a specific author or patron. The systematic process of adaptation within the manuscript favors author anonymity and a more personalized approach to abstracting meaning from texts. This essay argues that the continuity of this reading experience across the compendium’s patchwork of devotional and political contents shows a reception history for Machaut’s poetry that was driven by readership more than authorship.", "article_title": "Devotional and Political Consolation in Paris, BnF, fr. 994", "authors": [{"given": "Rachel", "family": "Geer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
