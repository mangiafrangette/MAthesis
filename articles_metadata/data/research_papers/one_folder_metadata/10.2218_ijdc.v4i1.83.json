It will commence by outlining the context within which ANDS was conceived, both in the international research and Australian research support domains. It will then describe the process that brought about the ANDS vision and the principles that informed the realisation of that vision. The paper will then outline each of the four ANDS programs (Developing Frameworks, Providing Utilities, Seeding the Commons, and Building Capabilities) while also discussing particular items of note about the approach ANDS is taking. The paper concludes by briefly examining related work in the UK and US.", "article_title": "Design and Implementation of the Australian National Data Service", "authors": [{"given": "Andrew", "family": "Treloar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Monash University, Australia", "normalized_name": "Monash University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02bfwt286", "GRID": "grid.1002.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
