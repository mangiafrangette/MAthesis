Using the computer as a new textual medium has brought about a renewed interest in the conditions for representation. This article concerns itself with how books and computers, respectively, represent texts, and how critical editing mediates or organizes those representations. It was written in 1997 as a critical response to J.J. McGann's essay ‘The Rationale of Hypertext’.", "article_title": "Material text, immaterial text, and the electronic environment", "authors": [{"given": " Kathryn", "family": "Sutherland", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "St Anne's College, University of Oxford, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Oxford", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052gg0110", "GRID": "grid.4991.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
