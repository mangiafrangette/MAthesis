Recognition of such factors is essential to assessing annotation (or its absence) as potential evidence for the interests of individual readers. I conclude with discussion of the promise and hazards of manuscript digitization for the study of annotation.", "article_title": "“It is to harde for my lernyng”: Making Sense of Annotations in Brut Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": "Julia", "family": "Marvin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Notre Dame", "normalized_name": "University of Notre Dame", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00mkhxb43", "GRID": "grid.131063.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
