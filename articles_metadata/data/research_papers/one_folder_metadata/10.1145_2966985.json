In fact, the preservation of archaeological objects has always been an issue of concern for the research community. On the one hand, the fragility of the objects limits their study. On the other hand, such objects are housed in museums, libraries, and institutions worldwide, locations that significantly limit their accessibility. Different survey methods have been carried out in these attempts to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Among them, the MicMac open source software was used in this work to survey and process the dense correlation of the hieroglyphics inscriptions engraved on archaeological stones. Relatively standard workflows have led to depth maps, which can be represented either as 3D point clouds or shaded relief images. This article shows the application of this method in two epigraphic survey case studies.", "article_title": "Close-Range Photogrammetric Tools for Epigraphic Surveys", "authors": [{"given": "Mariam", "family": "Samaan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "École Nationale des Sciences Géographiques, Marne-la-Vallée cedex, France", "normalized_name": "National School of Geographical Sciences", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03r3n3715", "GRID": "grid.454313.4"}}]}, {"given": "Marc Pierrot", "family": "Deseilligny", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "École Nationale des Sciences Géographiques, Marne-la-Vallée cedex, France", "normalized_name": "National School of Geographical Sciences", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03r3n3715", "GRID": "grid.454313.4"}}]}, {"given": "Raphaële", "family": "Heno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "École Nationale des Sciences Géographiques, Marne-la-Vallée cedex, France", "normalized_name": "National School of Geographical Sciences", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03r3n3715", "GRID": "grid.454313.4"}}]}, {"given": "Etienne De La", "family": "Vaissière", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "École des hautes études en sciences sociales, Paris, France", "normalized_name": "School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02d9dg697", "GRID": "grid.17673.34"}}]}, {"given": "Jacques", "family": "Roger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Direction régionale des Affaires Culturelles du Limousin, Limoges, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "9", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
