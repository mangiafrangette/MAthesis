Still, the appropriate balance between the plurality and the limitation of possible interpretations is a non-trivial issue. Whereas it is sensible to accept that literary texts can generally have various meanings, it should not be possible to attribute any kind of meaning to a text. Therefore, while interpreters must be allowed to disagree in their analyses, it must at the same time be possible to review whether a disagreement is actually based on adequate reasons like, for example, textual ambiguity or polyvalence. In this paper, we propose a best practice model as one effective means to review disagreement in accordance with literary studies principles. The model has been developed during the collaborative, computer-assisted annotation of literary texts in a project in which short stories have been analyzed narratologically. The examination of inconsistently annotated text passages revealed four types of reasons for disagreement: misinterpretations, deficient definitions of the categories of analysis, dependencies of the relevant categories on preliminary analyses, and textual ambiguity/polyvalence. We argue that only disagreements based on textual ambiguity are considered legitimate or valuable cases of disagreement, whereas the other three types of disagreement can be resolved in a systematic way.
