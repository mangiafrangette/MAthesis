The essential prerequisite for an electronic edition is the preparation of its object as a computer-assisted edition. The critical and synoptic edition of James Joyce's Ulysses, published in book form in 1984/86, was computer-assisted through the entire range of textual, critical, and presentational preparation. An electronic edition can be designed and realised from that book edition's database. The present contribution surveys the demands to be made of such an electronic edition and indicates what conceptual, editorial and technical operations and operationalizations are required to achieve it.", "article_title": "Towards an electronic edition of James Joyce's Ulysses", "authors": [{"given": " HW", "family": "Gabler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " University of München, München, Germany Correspondence address: Schellingstrasse 9, 80799 München, Germany E-mail: hans-walter.gabler@anglistik.uni-muenchen.de ", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
