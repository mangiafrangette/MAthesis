This paper analyses work undertaken by the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure project (EHRI) to develop heritage archives into research infrastructures by connecting their knowledge and making it relevant for research. In the article, we focus on EHRI’s work on an integrated collection portal, acting as a central gateway to the rich information on Holocaust-related sources. At the time of writing, the portal contains over 150,000 descriptions of over 1,850 institutions that hold Holocaust-related archival material in 51 countries. In addition, it hosts concise reports that provide in-depth per-country information about the Holocaust history and archival situation in 47 countries, topic-focused research guides, and a range of other services. The article presents how the EHRI portal work connects to the state of the art of heritage portals and the novel solutions we had to develop to align the portal with the requirements of a research infrastructure.", "article_title": "The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure Portal", "authors": [{"given": "Tobias", "family": "Blanke", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Bryant", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Michal", "family": "Frankl", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Jewish Museum Prague", "normalized_name": "Jewish Museum in Prague", "country": "Czechia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04ahqr359", "GRID": "grid.448250.f"}}]}, {"given": "Conny", "family": "Kristel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen", "normalized_name": "Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043c0p156", "GRID": "grid.418101.d"}}]}, {"given": "Reto", "family": "Speck", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Veerle Vanden", "family": "Daelen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre d’Etudes et de Documentation Guerre et Sociétés Contemporaines", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "René Van", "family": "Horik", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen", "normalized_name": "Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043c0p156", "GRID": "grid.418101.d"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2017-01-03", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
