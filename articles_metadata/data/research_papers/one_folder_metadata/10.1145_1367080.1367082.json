Detailed and accurate digital 3D models can be produced with 3D scanning devices, which allow conversion of reality into digital form in a cost and time-effective manner. We present the capabilities of this technology and the main issues which are preventing its wider use in contemporary applications, highlighting some open problems and a few promising new approaches for 3D model construction. We also briefly review some CH applications which could boost the diffusion and evolution of 3D scanning technology.", "article_title": "Sampled 3D models for CH applications", "authors": [{"given": "Paolo", "family": "Cignoni", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI), Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Pisa, Italy", "normalized_name": "National Research Council", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04zaypm56", "GRID": "grid.5326.2"}}]}, {"given": "Roberto", "family": "Scopigno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI), Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), Pisa, Italy", "normalized_name": "National Research Council", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04zaypm56", "GRID": "grid.5326.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2009-01-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
