This prototype is able to capture, model, and recognize musical gestures (upper body including fingers) as well as to sonify them. The emotional status of the performer affects the sound parameters at the synthesis level. Intangible Musical Instrument is able to support both learning and performing/composing by providing to the user not only intuitive gesture control but also a unique user experience. In addition, the first evaluation of the Intangible Musical Instrument is presented, in which all the functionalities of the system are assessed. Overall, the results with respect to this evaluation were very promising.", "article_title": "A Natural User Interface for Gestural Expression and Emotional Elicitation to Access the Musical Intangible Cultural Heritage", "authors": [{"given": "Christina", "family": "Volioti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Macedonia", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fg6gr82", "GRID": "grid.10212.30"}}]}, {"given": "Sotiris", "family": "Manitsaris", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "MINES ParisTech, Paris, France", "normalized_name": "Mines ParisTech", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04y8cs423", "GRID": "grid.58140.38"}}]}, {"given": "Edgar", "family": "Hemery", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "MINES ParisTech, Paris, France", "normalized_name": "Mines ParisTech", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04y8cs423", "GRID": "grid.58140.38"}}]}, {"given": "Stelios", "family": "Hadjidimitriou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece", "normalized_name": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02j61yw88", "GRID": "grid.4793.9"}}]}, {"given": "Vasileios", "family": "Charisis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece", "normalized_name": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02j61yw88", "GRID": "grid.4793.9"}}]}, {"given": "Leontios", "family": "Hadjileontiadis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece", "normalized_name": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02j61yw88", "GRID": "grid.4793.9"}}]}, {"given": "Eleni", "family": "Katsouli", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Macedonia", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fg6gr82", "GRID": "grid.10212.30"}}]}, {"given": "Fabien", "family": "Moutarde", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "MINES ParisTech, Paris, France", "normalized_name": "Mines ParisTech", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04y8cs423", "GRID": "grid.58140.38"}}]}, {"given": "Athanasios", "family": "Manitsaris", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Macedonia", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fg6gr82", "GRID": "grid.10212.30"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2018-04-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "11", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
