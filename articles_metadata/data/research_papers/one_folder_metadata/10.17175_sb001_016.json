The software Redcolor-Tool enables redness in images to be quantified for the first time. The technology attributes values of redness to any given color. This paper explores the methodological implications of color analysis for stylometric and historical approaches to visual studies. Furthermore, it examines the potential of new categories for the humanities which could emerge from quantitative feature metrics. The stylometry section is devoted to red color frequencies and color sums. A ›theory of coordination‹ based in stylometry is proposed as the methodological key. The historical section analyses red as the symbol of power and authority. Portraits from Titian´s Charles V to Bush´s portrait of Angela Merkel are analysed, taking the color red as the interpretational basis of traditional and contemporary political iconography.
