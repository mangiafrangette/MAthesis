The current trend appears to be one of abandonment – for example, the Indiana University Libraries no longer maintain machines capable of accessing early CD-ROM titles.In previous work, we proposed an access model based upon networked ‘virtual collections’ of CD-ROMs which can enable consortia of libraries to pool the technical expertise necessary to provide continued access to such materials for a geographically sparse base of patrons, who may have limited technical knowledge.In this paper, we extend this idea to CD-ROMs designed to operate on ‘classic’ Macintosh systems with an extensive case study – the catalog of the Voyager Company publications, which was the first major innovator in interactive CD-ROMs. The work described includes emulator extensions to support obsolete CD formats and to enable networked access to the virtual collection.", "article_title": "Developing Virtual CD-ROM Collections: The Voyager Company Publications", "authors": [{"given": "Geoffrey", "family": "Brown", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing", "normalized_name": "Indiana University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kg8sb98", "GRID": "grid.257410.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2012-10-23", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
