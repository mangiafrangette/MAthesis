In researching the One Laptop Per Child Initiative, by way of a donation of XO laptops, the MAL has devised a modular process which could be used by other research groups to investigate the gap between the intended use and the affordances of any given piece of technology.", "article_title": "Anarchive as technique in the Media Archaeology Lab | building a one Laptop Per Child mesh network", "authors": [{"given": "libi", "family": "striegl", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Intermedia Arts, Writing, and Performance Program, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Colorado Boulder", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ttsq026", "GRID": "grid.266190.a"}}]}, {"given": "Lori", "family": "Emerson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English and Intermedia Arts, Writing, and Performance Program, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Colorado Boulder", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ttsq026", "GRID": "grid.266190.a"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
