This article provides an overview of some of the issues involved with publishing educational research as a digital web-based thesis. It also introduces the term multimodal theses and dissertations (MTDs) and reports on a Ph.D. research project which is an early example of an MTD in the field of education. The purpose of this article is three-fold: (1) to stand on the shoulders of those in the digital humanities to expand the growing field of digital scholarship to include education; (2) to report on a range of unanticipated affordances arising from the MTD format in addition to the obvious benefits of ease of use, embedded media, and functionality; (3) to propose a transdisciplinary protocol for digital scholarship to assist researchers, librarians, and graduate school administrators in various disciplines.", "article_title": "A transdisciplinary protocol for digital scholarship", "authors": [{"given": " Brendan", "family": "Jacobs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Education and the Arts, CQUniversity, Australia", "normalized_name": "Central Queensland University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/023q4bk22", "GRID": "grid.1023.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
