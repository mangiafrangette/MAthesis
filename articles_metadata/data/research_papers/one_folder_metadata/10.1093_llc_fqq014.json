The texts included in this study are the four Gospels and the book of Acts in Martin Luther’s classic translation of the Bible and the modern translation Hoffnung für alle (Hfa). The study is both quantitative and qualitative in nature, looking at lexical bundle statistics in aggregate and at specific uses of lexical bundles in context. The results indicate that the older translation used many more lexical bundles, but types that were used by the newer version were used more effectively. Overall, however, the older version has the advantage in readability due to its greater use of lexical bundles.", "article_title": "Lexical bundles and German bibles", "authors": [{"given": "N.", "family": "Shrefler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2010-09-17", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "26", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
