The approach relies on a combination of NLP, Semantic web technologies, and network analysis. The classification methodology that first starts from single nodes and then generalizes to cliques is effective in terms of performance and is able to deal also with nodes that are not linked to Wikipedia. The gold standard manually developed for evaluation shows that groups of co-occurring entities share in most of the cases a category that can be automatically assigned. This holds for both languages considered in this study. The outcome of this work may be of interest to enhance the readability of large networks and to provide an additional semantic layer on top of cliques. This would greatly help humanities scholars when dealing with large amounts of textual data that need to be interpreted or categorized. Furthermore, it represents an unsupervised approach to automatically extend DBpedia starting from a corpus.", "article_title": "Using Semantic Linking to Understand Persons’ Networks Extracted from Text", "authors": [{"given": "Alessio", "family": "Palmero Aprosio", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Humanities Research Unit, Center for Information and Communication Technology, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Sara", "family": "Tonelli", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Humanities Research Unit, Center for Information and Communication Technology, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Stefano", "family": "Menini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Humanities Research Unit, Center for Information and Communication Technology, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Giovanni", "family": "Moretti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Trento", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05trd4x28", "GRID": "grid.11696.39"}}]}], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Frontiers in Digital Humanities", "volume": "4", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2297-2668", "type": "electronic"}]}
