We present research results concerning 3D technologies that are used in the digital anastylosis of cultural heritage monuments. Based on current state-of-the-art research, we present 3D data collection, digital artifacts reconstruction, and digital reassembly of existing fragments illustrated by means of the Octagon monument in Ephesos, Turkey. Our focus is on methods that belong to geometry processing.", "article_title": "Digital anastylosis of the Octagon in Ephesos", "authors": [{"given": "Barbara", "family": "Thuswaldner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Vienna University of Technology, Vienna", "normalized_name": "TU Wien", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d836q62", "GRID": "grid.5329.d"}}]}, {"given": "Simon", "family": "Flöry", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Vienna University of Technology, Vienna", "normalized_name": "TU Wien", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d836q62", "GRID": "grid.5329.d"}}]}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Kalasek", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Vienna University of Technology, Vienna", "normalized_name": "TU Wien", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d836q62", "GRID": "grid.5329.d"}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Hofer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Vienna University of Technology, Vienna", "normalized_name": "TU Wien", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04d836q62", "GRID": "grid.5329.d"}}]}, {"given": "Qi-Xing", "family": "Huang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stanford University, Stanford", "normalized_name": "Stanford University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00f54p054", "GRID": "grid.168010.e"}}]}, {"given": "Hilke", "family": "Thür", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
