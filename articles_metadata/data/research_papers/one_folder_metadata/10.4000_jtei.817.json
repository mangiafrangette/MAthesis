This article describes the design of version 4 of the PhiloLogic corpus query engine, which is designed to handle heterogeneous TEI encoding through its redesigned abstract data model. We show that such an architecture has substantial benefits for software reuse, allowing for powerful TEI applications to be adapted to new corpora with a minimum of custom programming, and we discuss the more general and theoretical implications of abstraction as a TEI processing technique.", "article_title": "PhiloLogic4: An Abstract TEI Query System", "authors": [{"given": "Timothy", "family": "Allen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Chicago", "normalized_name": "University of Chicago", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024mw5h28", "GRID": "grid.170205.1"}}]}, {"given": "Clovis", "family": "Gladstone", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Chicago", "normalized_name": "University of Chicago", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024mw5h28", "GRID": "grid.170205.1"}}]}, {"given": "Richard", "family": "Whaling", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Chicago", "normalized_name": "University of Chicago", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024mw5h28", "GRID": "grid.170205.1"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 5", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
