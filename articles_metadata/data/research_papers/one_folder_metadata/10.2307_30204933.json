We describe three increasingly complex algorithms: a simple baseline iterative method, and two non-iterative more elaborated versions. While the baseline algorithm is mainly described for illustrative purposes, the non-iterative algorithms outline the use of different working hypotheses which may be motivated by different kinds of applications and to some extent by the languages concerned. The first two algorithms rely on cross-lingual POS preservation, while with the third one POS invariance is not an extraction condition. The evaluation of the algorithms was conducted on three different corpora and several pairs of languages.", "article_title": "Extracting Multilingual Lexicons from Parallel Corpora", "authors": [{"given": "Dan", "family": "Tufi≈ü", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Romanian Academy (RACAI), 13, \"13 Septembrie\", 050711, Bucharest 5, Romania", "normalized_name": "Romanian Academy", "country": "Romania", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0561n6946", "GRID": "grid.418333.e"}}]}, {"given": "Ana Maria", "family": "Barbu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Romanian Academy (RACAI), 13, \"13 Septembrie\", 050711, Bucharest 5, Romania", "normalized_name": "Romanian Academy", "country": "Romania", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0561n6946", "GRID": "grid.418333.e"}}]}, {"given": "Radu", "family": "Ion", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Romanian Academy (RACAI), 13, \"13 Septembrie\", 050711, Bucharest 5, Romania", "normalized_name": "Romanian Academy", "country": "Romania", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0561n6946", "GRID": "grid.418333.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
