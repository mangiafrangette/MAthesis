Lichtenberg - that words stand still while the world designated by them moves on and that therefore words ought to be reexamined periodically for their adequacy vis-à-vis the new realities - the essay explores the term ›Spiel‹ (›play‹/›game‹) for its possible potential as a key-concept linking post-kantian Aesthetics, Gadamer’s Hermeneutics and Iser’s Reader-Response Criticism as analytical tools for the new artistic genres of electronic hyperfiction and computer games. Tracing the history of the term ›Spiel‹ as it oscillates between an abstract figurative meaning as a purely mental interplay between the different cognitive faculties and its reference to concrete performative acts in a leisurely purposeless mood the authors show their branching out into an outright dichotomy in the post-kantian Aesthetics and they postulate the re-convergence of the two meanings in the new artistic forms of literary hyperfictions and computer games.", "article_title": "ÜBER DEN ÄSTHETISCHEN BEGRIFF DES SPIELS ALS LINK ZWISCHEN TRADITIONELLER TEXTHERMENEUTIK, HYPERFICTION UND COMPUTERSPIELEN", "authors": [{"given": "Manuela", "family": "Kocher", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Zürich", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Böhler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Zürich", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
