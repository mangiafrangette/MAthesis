Therefore, the team is digitizing, describing and enriching the reading notes that the philosopher gathered while preparing his books and lectures, thus providing a new corpus that will allow a new approach to his work. In order to release the manuscripts online, and to collectively produce the data, the team is also developing a collaborative platform, based on RDF technologies, and designed to link together archival content and bibliographic data. This project is financed by the ANR (2017-2020) and coordinated by Michel Senellart, professor of philosophy at the ENS Lyon. It benefits from the partnerships of the ENS/PSL and the BnF. In addition, a collaboration with the European READ/Transkribus project has been started so as to produce automatic transcription of the reading notes.", "article_title": "Transcribing Foucault’s handwriting with Transkribus", "authors": [{"given": "Marie-Laure", "family": "Massot", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CAPHÉS - Centre d’Archives en Philosophie, Histoire et Édition des Sciences", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Arianna", "family": "Sforzini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TRIANGLE - Triangle : action, discours, pensée politique et économique", "normalized_name": "ACTION", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04hxzf837", "GRID": "grid.427632.6"}}]}, {"given": "Vincent", "family": "Ventresque", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TRIANGLE - Triangle : action, discours, pensée politique et économique", "normalized_name": "ACTION", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04hxzf837", "GRID": "grid.427632.6"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2019", "keywords": ["transkribus", "reading notes", "automatic transcription of manuscripts", "artificial intelligence"], "journal_title": "Journal of Data Mining & Digital Humanities", "volume": "Atelier Digit_Hum", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
