This essay employs computational stylometry—specifically, n-gram analysis—and network analysis to address this problem. It proposes methods for screening out chance n-grams and for employing n-grams of various lengths within a single analysis to show that, in Old English poetry, formulaic diction exists at the level of idiolect, sociolect, and language. Specifically, the signed poems of Cynewulf evince idiolectal characteristics; and along with Andreas, Christ III, The Phoenix, and Guthlac A and B, they form a poetic subtradition (sociolect).", "article_title": "Using N-gram Analysis to Map Intertextual Networks in Old English Verse", "authors": [{"given": "Paul", "family": "Battles", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Hanover College", "normalized_name": "Hanover College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00vc14296", "GRID": "grid.431583.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019-10-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
