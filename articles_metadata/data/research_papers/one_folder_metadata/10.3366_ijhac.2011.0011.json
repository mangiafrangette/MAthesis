The Endangered Languages Archive at SOAS is creating a new archive to take advantage of web-based social networking to address these issues. The archive is reconceived as a platform for conducting relationships between information providers (depositors) and information users, using the now-familiar idiom of Facebook. Rather than the archive having to continually broker complex access conditions, depositors and requesters can negotiate directly with each other via the archive to achieve more flexible and creative outcomes.
