Considering the size of the manuscripts, calculated according to surface area, the paper compares musical layout across the six Machaut manuscripts including his musical works (Paris, BnF, fr. 1584, 1585, 1586, 9221, 22545â€“6, and the Ferrell manuscript). Focusing on BnF fr. 9221, which is the largest and latest of these manuscripts, and is often criticized for its musical readings, the paper examines the idea of authority and considers the value of the manuscript to its original owner, the Duke of Berry.", "article_title": "Why Size Matters: Music Layout and Order in the Machaut Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": "Jennifer", "family": "Bain", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Dalhousie University", "normalized_name": "Dalhousie University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e6qks80", "GRID": "grid.55602.34"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
