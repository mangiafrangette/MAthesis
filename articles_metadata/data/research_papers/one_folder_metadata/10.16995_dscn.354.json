The means have certainly changed, but these striking changes have also influenced the methods and meaning of writing, the concepts of writer and reader, and the methods of access, the tools and methods of distributing texts, images, sounds, etc. Literature has played a major role in the development of cultural domains; it still holds a prominent place, perhaps even more so today, as our current context is greatly associated to the predominance of the textual form. The explosion of data and the transformation of knowledge, both in terms of the quality of available information and the manner of representing it, have furthermore had a considerable impact on human and social sciences research.", "article_title": "Introduction: « Humanités numériques: identités, pratiques et théories »", "authors": [{"given": "Sophie", "family": "Marcotte", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Concordia University", "normalized_name": "Concordia University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01qxhf360", "GRID": "grid.448967.0"}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Sinatra", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0161xgx34", "GRID": "grid.14848.31"}}]}, {"given": "Stéfan", "family": "Sinclair", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McGill University", "normalized_name": "McGill University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01pxwe438", "GRID": "grid.14709.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019-08-07", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
