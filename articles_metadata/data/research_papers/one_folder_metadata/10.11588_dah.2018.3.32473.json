Whereas 3D reconstruction has been incorporated into a multitude of research applications, essential methodological foundations for more widespread utilisation of digital reconstructions have yet to be developed. Against this background, the aim of this article is to consider the question as to how the methodology of 3D reconstruction alters research cultures in architectural and art history by exemplifying three problem areas, (1) research functions of 3D reconstructions and their drawback to a current research culture in art history, (2) consequences of cross-disciplinary project-based teamwork as main cooperation format within 3D reconstruction projects, and (3) problems and difficulties caused by imagery as primary media for research and communication.", "article_title": "3D Reconstruction Techniques as a Cultural Shift in Art History?", "authors": [{"given": "Sander", "family": "Münster", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TU Dresden, Dresden University of Technology", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Kristina", "family": "Friedrichs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TU Dresden, Dresden University of Technology", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Wolfgang", "family": "Hegel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Würzdburg University", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal for Digital Art History", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2363-5401", "type": "electronic"}, {"value": "2363-5398", "type": "print"}]}
