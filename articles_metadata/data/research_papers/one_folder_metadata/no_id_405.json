The recent high and fast-rising cost of journals has had a devastating effect on the flow of scientific communication, the research community, and library collections. The following article provides an overview of the forces in the scientific communication market focusing on the particularly difficult situation for journals in the scientific, technical and medical (STM) fields. The impact of rising journal prices is aggravated by the availability of new media – such as Web editions of existing journals. Researchers – whose work is paid for by the university or the federal government – increasingly give away their research to commercial journals, which then charge universities high subscription fees in order to buy it back. The papers that appear in STM journals are typically provided free by academic researchers and are subject to peer review by academic referees and editors, who also receive little if any remuneration. To alleviate this difficult situation, numerous projects that represent a direct and strong competitive alternative to existing high-priced titles in important established STM fields have been launched. This article describes the far reaching transformation of the STM publishing market under way which will also change other scientific professions such as the humanities.", "article_title": "AUTOREN ALS VERLEGER.
