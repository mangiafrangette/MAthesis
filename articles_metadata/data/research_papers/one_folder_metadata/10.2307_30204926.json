To employ hypertext effectively, more information about the hypertext authoring process is needed. There are features of hypertext which are not reflected in traditional theories of composition, especially the possibility to structure information visually. Our study indicates that graphical overview maps which can be edited are a rather attractive feature of hypertext authoring systems. Nevertheless, not all students profit from such features. Students employ different writing styles when they create hypertext documents. The majority of students experiments with hypertext's new features but others are still influenced by the model of the book.", "article_title": "Hypertext Writing Profiles and Visualisation", "authors": [{"given": "Margit", "family": "Pohl", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Design and Technology Assessment University of Technology Vienna, Austria", "normalized_name": "Universiti Teknologi MARA", "country": "Malaysia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05n8tts92", "GRID": "grid.412259.9"}}]}, {"given": "Peter", "family": "Purgathofer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Design and Technology Assessment University of Technology Vienna, Austria", "normalized_name": "Universiti Teknologi MARA", "country": "Malaysia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05n8tts92", "GRID": "grid.412259.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
