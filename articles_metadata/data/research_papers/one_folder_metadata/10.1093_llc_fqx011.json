Any method for identifying such pseudepigrapha must ultimately depend on some measure of a given document’s similarity to the other documents in a corpus. We show that for this purpose, second-order document similarity measures taken from the authorship verification literature strongly outperform standard document similarity measures commonly used for outlier identification. We apply these improved methods to two famous corpora suspected of including pseudepigrapha: Shakespeare’s plays and Pauline epistles.", "article_title": "Detecting pseudepigraphic texts using novel similarity measures", "authors": [{"given": " Moshe", "family": "Koppel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer, Bar Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}, {"given": " Shachar", "family": "Seidman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer, Bar Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-03-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "33", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
