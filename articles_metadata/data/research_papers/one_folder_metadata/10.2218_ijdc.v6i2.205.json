Data publication is becoming increasingly important to the scientific community, as it will provide a mechanism for those who create data to receive academic credit for their work and will allow the conclusions arising from an analysis to be more readily verifiable, thus promoting transparency in the scientific process. Peer review of data will also provide a mechanism for ensuring the quality of datasets, and we provide suggestions on the types of activities one expects to see in the peer review of data. A simple taxonomy of data publication methodologies is presented and evaluated, and the paper concludes with a discussion of dataset granularity, transience and semantics, along with a recommended human-readable citation syntax.", "article_title": "Citation and Peer Review of Data: Moving Towards Formal Data Publication", "authors": [{"given": "Bryan", "family": "Lawrence", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03gq8fr08", "GRID": "grid.76978.37"}}]}, {"given": "Catherine", "family": "Jones", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03gq8fr08", "GRID": "grid.76978.37"}}]}, {"given": "Brian", "family": "Matthews", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03gq8fr08", "GRID": "grid.76978.37"}}]}, {"given": "Sam", "family": "Pepler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03gq8fr08", "GRID": "grid.76978.37"}}]}, {"given": "Sarah", "family": "Callaghan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03gq8fr08", "GRID": "grid.76978.37"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
