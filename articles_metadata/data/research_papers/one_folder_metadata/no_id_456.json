This article discusses how the online edition dealt with the richness of material (using the strategies of flexibility and user control, powerful search and filter facilities and indexing and cross-referencing). It describes the technical infrastructure and the conversion that was needed from word processor documents into XML. It also examines the relation between the book and web versions of the edition. In conclusion, the article mentions some of the user reactions to the edition and briefly mentions some of the prospects for future scholarly editions.", "article_title": "Vincent Van Gogh - The Letters", "authors": [{"given": "Peter", "family": "Boot", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Huygens Institute, Dept.
