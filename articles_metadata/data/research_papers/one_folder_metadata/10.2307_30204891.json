The vocabulary is described by means of two sets of variables. One is based on the number of tokens and types, word length and sectioning of the running text. The other set divides the corpus into grammatical categories. Both sets of variables are related to a number of background variables such as gender, socioeconomic background, education, and indicators of verbal proficiency at age 13 and 32. This possibility to study the relationship between vocabulary and a broad set of respondent characteristics is a unique feature of this corpus.", "article_title": "Vocabulary in Interviews as Related to Respondent Characteristics", "authors": [{"given": "Kjell", "family": "HÃ¤rnqvist", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Goteborg University, Sweden", "normalized_name": "University of Gothenburg", "country": "Sweden", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tm6cn81", "GRID": "grid.8761.8"}}]}, {"given": "Ulf", "family": "Christianson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Goteborg University, Sweden", "normalized_name": "University of Gothenburg", "country": "Sweden", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tm6cn81", "GRID": "grid.8761.8"}}]}, {"given": "Daniel", "family": "Ridings", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Goteborg University, Sweden", "normalized_name": "University of Gothenburg", "country": "Sweden", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tm6cn81", "GRID": "grid.8761.8"}}]}, {"given": "Jan-Gunnar", "family": "Tingsell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Goteborg University, Sweden", "normalized_name": "University of Gothenburg", "country": "Sweden", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tm6cn81", "GRID": "grid.8761.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2003-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "37", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
