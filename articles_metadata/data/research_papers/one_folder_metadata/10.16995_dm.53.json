In order to be useful for researchers these sources must include metadata or semantic links that can connect them to concepts relevant to the study of religions. This paper outlines ways in which some very different source types, including textual sources, place-names, pictures and figurines, can be incorporated into a single resource. The aim is to both facilitate analysis and to separate documentary processes from interpretative ones. This structure has been tested using a web interface for both searching and data entry. Some possibilities for representing the visual and spatial data associated with the proposed resource are also demonstrated.", "article_title": "Semantic linking of the Pre-Christian Religions of the North", "authors": [{"given": "Tarrin", "family": "Wills", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Aberdeen", "normalized_name": "University of Aberdeen", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/016476m91", "GRID": "grid.7107.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "9", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.53"}
