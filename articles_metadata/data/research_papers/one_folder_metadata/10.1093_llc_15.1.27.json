Computers are of use in the study and editing of them in eight ways (i) in collating witnesses, especially to improve accuracy; (ii) in being able to alter a base text without having to revise a complicated apparatus criticus; (iii) in analysis of manuscript relationships; (iv) in the selection of the most significant witnesses; (v) in producing an edition; (vi) in the area of collaboration; (vii) they do away with the need to redo good work; (viii) they make possible a wide range of presentations, including change of presentation at will, use of multiple typefaces cheaply, presenting multiple states of the text, and placing information in levels, connected to one another by hyperlinks. Even though the goal of any major critical edition should continue to be a paper edition, it will be worth scholars' while to develop computer-based resources.", "article_title": "The text of the New Testament and computers: The International Greek New Testament Project", "authors": [{"given": " DC", "family": "Parker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Department of Theology, University of Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK E-mail: D.C.Parker@bham.ac.uk ", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
