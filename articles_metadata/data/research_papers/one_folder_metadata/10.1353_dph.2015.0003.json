Part I analyzes the concept of the internal, potentially unreliable narrator, widely regarded as a narratological necessity. Part II examines the history of the term narrator. Part III studies the theories of narration implied by scribal annotations in some medieval manuscripts. Parts IV, V, and VI discuss three medieval cases—Malory’s Morte Darthur, Chaucer’s Physician’s Tale and the anonymous Pearl—in which application of the narrator theory proves to be misleading.", "article_title": "What is a Narrator?: Narrator Theory and Medieval Narratives", "authors": [{"given": "A.
