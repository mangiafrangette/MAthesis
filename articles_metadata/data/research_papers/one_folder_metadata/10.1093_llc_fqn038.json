Therefore it is somewhat worrisome that there are far more digital libraries than digital editions. This essay argues that the reason for this is not only a pressure towards all-inclusiveness but also the fact that scholarly editions are addressing both scholars and common readers, each of them having their own expectations of what a digital edition should actually offer. The essay suggests that we should get away from the idea of access to data as the principal merit of the edition and suggests a model of criticism instead, meaning that editors should represent their work as providing critical points of view on the texts they are offering, with their actual contents thrown in.", "article_title": "Access", "authors": [{"given": " John", "family": "Lavagnino", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
