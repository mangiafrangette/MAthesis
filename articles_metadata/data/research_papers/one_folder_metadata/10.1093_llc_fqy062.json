However, an objective assessment of these aspects of fictional stories remains a relatively new and technically difficult field. In this brief report, we introduce our study in which we modeled story dynamics from a novel perspective. By implementing a relational event model based on a two-mode network framework in an analytical system for movie scripts, we examined the interdependence of character activities and their participation in a given plot on the basis of an analysis of more than 900 scripts from the Internet Movie Script Database.", "article_title": "Representing stories as interdependent dynamics of character activities and plots: A two-mode network relational event model", "authors": [{"given": " Dingding", "family": "Chao", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Systems Innovation, The University of Tokyo, Japan", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": " Taro", "family": "Kanno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Systems Innovation, The University of Tokyo, Japan", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": " Kazuo", "family": "Furuta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Tokyo, Japan", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": " Chen", "family": "Lin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Systems Innovation, The University of Tokyo, Japan", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
