The Web asdatabase has also the enormous advantage over other language corpora of behaving like natural language: it is dynamic, unceasingly renewing itself and thus offering snapshots of the present state of the language, with its proportion of new, established and aging usage. The paper discusses the observation, since 1998, of French, including derivation, polysemy, homophony, syntagmatic variation and the genesis of new concepts and their linguistic naming. The language corpora observed are those of micro-systems — particular words, word families and lexical constructions — and not the macro-system of the language as a whole. The tools used in the observation are keywords and search engines, in particular Google.", "article_title": "The World Wide Web as a Linguistic Corpus", "authors": [{"given": "Russon", "family": "Wooldridge", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Toronto", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005", "keywords": ["World Wide Web, corpus linguistics, WWW as database, polysemy, homophony, syntagmatic variation, neology"], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}]}
