Single N-gram tokenization technique works well; however, it often generates stems that start with intermediate characters, rather than initial ones. We present a novel technique that takes the concept of N-gram stemming one step ahead and compare our method with an established algorithm in the field, say, Porter’s stemmer for English, Spanish, and Portuguese languages. Results indicate that our N-gram stemmer is comparable with the Porter’s linguistic stemmer.", "article_title": "Generation, implementation, and appraisal of an N-gram-based stemming algorithm", "authors": [{"given": " Bhagwati P", "family": "Pande", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, SSJ Campus, Kumaun University, Almora, Uttarakhand, India", "normalized_name": "Kumaun University", "country": "India", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/038e9x269", "GRID": "grid.411155.5"}}]}, {"given": " Pawan", "family": "Tamta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Government Post Graduate College, Manila, Almora, Uttarakhand, India", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Hoshiyar S", "family": "Dhami", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Uttarakhand Residential University, Almora, Uttarakhand, India", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
