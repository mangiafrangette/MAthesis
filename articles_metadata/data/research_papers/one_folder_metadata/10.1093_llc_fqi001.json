The introduction of material from more than one exemplar into a new copy results in contamination of a textual tradition. This contamination causes problems in standard phylogenetic analysis. We use an application of the maximum Ï‡2 method (developed for the detection of recombination in DNA sequences) to identify locations where scribes may have changed their exemplar whilst copying the tale. Our results are largely in agreement with other published sources, indicating that this method may prove useful in the analysis of a contaminated tradition.", "article_title": "The Identification of Exemplar Change in the Wife of Bath's Prologue Using the Maximum Chi-Squared Method", "authors": [{"given": " Heather F.", "family": "Windram", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada", "normalized_name": "Dalhousie University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e6qks80", "GRID": "grid.55602.34"}}]}, {"given": " Christopher J.", "family": "Howe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada", "normalized_name": "Dalhousie University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e6qks80", "GRID": "grid.55602.34"}}]}, {"given": " Matthew", "family": "Spencer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada", "normalized_name": "Dalhousie University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e6qks80", "GRID": "grid.55602.34"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2005", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "20", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
