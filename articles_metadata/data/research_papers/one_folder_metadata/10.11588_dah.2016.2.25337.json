However, it is unclear whether such a centralized structure was truly inevitable, and if it persisted through the seventeenth century. This paper uses network analysis to infer these historical print production networks from two large databases of existing prints in order to characterize whether and how centralization of printmaking networks changed over the course of this period, and how these changes may have influenced individual printmakers.", "article_title": "Social Network Centralization Dynamics in Print Production in the Low Countries, 1550-1750", "authors": [{"given": "Matthew", "family": "Lincoln", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Getty Research Institute", "normalized_name": "Getty Research Institute", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00qb4ds53", "GRID": "grid.446893.4"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal for Digital Art History", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2363-5401", "type": "electronic"}, {"value": "2363-5398", "type": "print"}]}
