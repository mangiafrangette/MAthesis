Such a tool allows verse-writers to generate all the words that match with a given word termination. We deal with some interesting aspects, i.e. the dimension of the generated list and the need to establish an order of relevance among the listed items. This work can be seen as a way of reusing computational hguistic tools in the context of the Basque cultural means of expression. The technical foundations of this tool lie in a two-level morphological processor. The way in which words must be generated (starting from the end of the word) leads us to invert the generation process.", "article_title": "An assistant tool for verse-making in Basque based on two-level morphology", "authors": [{"given": " Bertol", "family": "Arrieta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of the Basque CountryDonostia, Basque Country", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " IÃ±aki", "family": "Alegria", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of the Basque CountryDonostia, Basque Country", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Xabier", "family": "Arregi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of the Basque CountryDonostia, Basque Country", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
