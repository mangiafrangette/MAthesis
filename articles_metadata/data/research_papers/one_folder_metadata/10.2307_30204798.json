The method fully exploits and extends the information available in the Hector dictionary. The algorithm proceeds by the application of several filters to prune the candidate set of word senses returning the most frequent if more than one remains. The experimental methodology and its implication are also discussed.", "article_title": "Word Sense Disambiguation by Information Filtering and Extraction", "authors": [{"given": "Jeremy", "family": "Ellman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " School of Computing & Information Systems, University of Sunderland, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sunderland", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04p55hr04", "GRID": "grid.7110.7"}}]}, {"given": "Ian", "family": "Klincke", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " School of Computing & Information Systems, University of Sunderland, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sunderland", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04p55hr04", "GRID": "grid.7110.7"}}]}, {"given": "John", "family": "Tait", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " School of Computing & Information Systems, University of Sunderland, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sunderland", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04p55hr04", "GRID": "grid.7110.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
