The present study explores one means of comparing aggregate analyses in order to determine linguistically concise characterizations of restrictions, essentially the use of factor analysis (FA). Using the Southern states data which Guy Lowman collected as part of LAMSAS, we apply FA to the vowels involved in aggregate analyses in order to determine which alternations in pronunciation tend most to co-occur.", "article_title": "Identifying Linguistic Structure in Aggregate Comparison", "authors": [{"given": " John", "family": "Nerbonne", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, 9700 AS Groningen, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "University of Groningen", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/012p63287", "GRID": "grid.4830.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2006", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "21", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
