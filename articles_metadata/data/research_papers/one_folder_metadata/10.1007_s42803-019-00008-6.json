Research can no longer be done in isolation as an increasing number of digital tools and certain types of knowledge are required to deal with research material. Research questions are scaled up and we see the emergence of new infrastructures to address this change. The DigitAl Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) is an open international network of researchers within the arts and humanities community, which revolves around the exchange of experiences and the sharing of expertise and resources. These resources comprise not only of digitised material, but also a wide variety of born-digital data, services and software, tools, learning and teaching materials. The sustaining, sharing and reuse of resources involves many different parties and stakeholders and is influenced by a multitude of factors in which research infrastructures play a pivotal role. This article describes how DARIAH tries to meet the requirements of researchers from a broad range of disciplines within the arts and humanities that work with (born-)digital research data. It details approaches situated in specific national contexts in an otherwise large heterogeneous international scenario and gives an overview of ongoing efforts towards a convergence of social and technical aspects.", "article_title": "A landscape of data – working with digital resources within and beyond DARIAH", "authors": [{"given": "Tibor", "family": "Kálmán", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbh Göttingen (GWDG), Göttingen, Germany", "normalized_name": "Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00cd95c65", "GRID": "grid.434972.f"}}]}, {"given": "Matej", "family": "Ďurčo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}]}, {"given": "Frank", "family": "Fischer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation", "normalized_name": "National Research University Higher School of Economics", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/055f7t516", "GRID": "grid.410682.9"}}]}, {"given": "Nicolas", "family": "Larrousse", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CNRS, Paris, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Claudio", "family": "Leone", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Göttingen State and University Library, Göttingen, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Karlheinz", "family": "Mörth", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria", "normalized_name": "Austrian Academy of Sciences", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03anc3s24", "GRID": "grid.4299.6"}}]}, {"given": "Carsten", "family": "Thiel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Göttingen State and University Library, Göttingen, Germany", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
