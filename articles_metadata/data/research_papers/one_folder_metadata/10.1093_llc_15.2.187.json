This paper examines the use of the Cascade-Correlation algorithm for the construction of minimal networks. We find that a number of problems in computational stylistics with a large number of variables but a limited number of training examples may be solved successfully without resorting to large networks. The issue of redundancy in the data is also considered.", "article_title": "Computational stylistics using artificial neural networks", "authors": [{"given": "S", "family": "Waugh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
