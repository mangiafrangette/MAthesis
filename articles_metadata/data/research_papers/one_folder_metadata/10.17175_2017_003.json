However, genres always reveal themselves as historically-based constructs with features that change and evolve over time. This paper illustrates how such historical developments in genres can be retraced with digital methods by means of a prominent example from Middle High German literature, Minnesang. With the help of frequency analysis and topic modeling, a research question which has been much debated will be discussed: whether there was an historical shift in genre during the development of Minnesang that differentiates the lyric poetry of the later period from ›classical‹ Sang.
