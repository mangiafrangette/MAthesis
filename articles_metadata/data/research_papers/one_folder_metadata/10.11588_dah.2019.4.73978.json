I invited two representatives of European and two of US curricula, which were split up respectively into one for Digital Art History and one for general Digital Humanities: Leif Isaksen (Professor of Digital Humanities, Exeter), Peter Bell (Junior professor for Digital Humanities, with a focus on Digital Art History, Erlangen-Nürnberg), Hannah Jacobs (Digital Humanities Specialist in the Wired! Lab for Digital Art & Visual Culture, Duke University), and Ashley Sanders Garcia (Vice Chair of the Digital Humanities Program, UCLA). Both of the European cases are recent implementations of new curricula, whereas the US-American had established courses. While established studies do exist in Europe, as for example at the University of London, they are still quite rare.", "article_title": "Summary of the Roundtable “Setting up a DH Curriculum or Certificate” at the Annual Meeting of the Renaissance Society of America (Toronto, March 19, 2019)", "authors": [{"given": "Angela", "family": "Dressen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "I Tatti, The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2020-07-23", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal for Digital Art History", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2363-5401", "type": "electronic"}, {"value": "2363-5398", "type": "print"}]}
