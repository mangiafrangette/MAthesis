Many encoders cannot take their work to the next level by transforming their collections of structured XML texts into a web searchable and browsable database. Often teams of text encoders are able to encode their texts with a high degree of sophistication, but unless they have funds to hire a programmer, their collections far too often remain on local disk storage away from public access. <teiPublisher> aims to relieve some of this burden by providing the tools to manage an extensible, modular and configurable XML-based repository which will house, search, browse, and display documents encoded in TEI-Lite on the world wide web. <teiPublisher> provides an administrative interface that allows DL and DH administrators to upload and delete documents from a web accessible repository; analyze XML documents to determine elements for searching and browsing; refine ontology development; select inter and intra document links; partition the repository into collections; create backups; generate search, browse, and display pages; customize the interface; and associate XSL transformation scripts and CSS stylesheets to obtain different target outputs (HTML, PDF, etc.).", "article_title": "<teiPublisher>: A Repository Management System for TEI Documents", "authors": [{"given": " Amit", "family": "Kumar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate
