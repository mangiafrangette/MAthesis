The performance of these tools largely depends on the hieroglyph representation quality. In the literature, the most successful hieroglyph representation for retrieval following the BoVW model includes a thinning hieroglyph process and selects interest points through uniform random sampling. However, thinned hieroglyphs could have noise or redundant information, and a random set of interest points could include non-useful interest points that are different in each iteration. In this article, we propose improving this hieroglyph representation by pruning thinned hieroglyphs and introducing an improved interest-point selection. Our experiments show that our proposal significantly improves the hieroglyph retrieval results of state-of-the-art methods.", "article_title": "Improved Hieroglyph Representation for Image Retrieval", "authors": [{"given": "Laura Alejandra", "family": "Pinilla-Buitrago", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica Óptica y Electrónica, San Andrés Cholula, Puebla, México", "normalized_name": "National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bpmmc63", "GRID": "grid.450293.9"}}]}, {"given": "Jesús Ariel", "family": "Carrasco-Ochoa", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica Óptica y Electrónica, San Andrés Cholula, Puebla, México", "normalized_name": "National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bpmmc63", "GRID": "grid.450293.9"}}]}, {"given": "José Fco", "family": "Martínez-Trinidad", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica Óptica y Electrónica, San Andrés Cholula, Puebla, México", "normalized_name": "National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00bpmmc63", "GRID": "grid.450293.9"}}]}, {"given": "Edgar", "family": "Román-Rangel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CVMLab, Department of Computer Science, University of Geneva, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Geneva", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01swzsf04", "GRID": "grid.8591.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "12", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
