The method computes archival bond by measuring the cosine similarity between document paragraphs. We tested the method in a chaotic case study collection created in a shared server by different authors. Results demonstrate that this method is more efficient to find stories than calculating the cosine similarity between entire documents. This research helps archivists make sense of collections that are considered inaccessible and whose stories may otherwise be lost.", "article_title": "Finding stories in the archive through paragraph alignment", "authors": [{"given": " Weijia", "family": "Xu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}, {"given": " Maria", "family": "Esteva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2011-05-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "26", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
