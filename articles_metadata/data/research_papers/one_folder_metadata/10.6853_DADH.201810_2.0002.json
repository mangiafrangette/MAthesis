In this paper, the Ubiqu + Ity tool provided by the Visualizing English Print (VEP) Website is used to analyze the spoken text of all major characters within Shakespeare's As You Like It. The Ubiqu+Ity tool provides several language action types (LATs), which are then classified as relational versus selfish, and active versus reflective. These classifications produce a method (called the character path walk) that visualizes the paths the characters ＂walk＂ through the play, leaving their ＂trails＂ behind that can then be visually analyzed. Upon initial analysis, using the play As You Like It as an example, minor characters such as Phoebe and Silvius revealed dramatic arcs in their speeches. Rosalind's roles as Catalyst (early in the play) and Conciliator (of Phoebe and Silvius) are also identified by applying the method. Some areas for further analysis and method development are suggested.", "article_title": "Navigating the Forest Through the Trees: Visualizing Character Paths Through Shakespeare’s As You Like It", "authors": [{"given": "Brian J.", "family": "Kokensparger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2018", "keywords": ["corpus linguistics ", " textual analysis ", " data visualization ", " early modern English drama "], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
