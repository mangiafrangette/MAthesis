Histories from the first 25 years of the world wide web, edited by Niels Brügger, is part of the Digital Formations series. Brügger’s collection takes the challenge of placing the (hi)story of the World Wide Web in a critical perspective seriously. The volume seeks to foster those working in web archiving, internet studies or web historiography to undertake innovative, cross-disciplinary research. The editor has brought together authors who collectively have contributed to a book that is a valuable addition to the emerging scholarship surrounding the study of the web and the web’s history. The book, divided in four sections, comprises ‘a number of probes into the vast and multifaceted past of the web’ (xi). However, the volume is neither designed to be exhaustive, nor comprehensive. It is broad in scope in relation to a number of aspects: (i) its variety of topics, (ii) its combination of case studies and methodological reflections and (iii) the compilation of chapters focusing on national as well as international WWW phenomena.", "article_title": "Web 25.
