Change-detection statistics proposed by MacNeill (1978) and Jandhayala and MacNeill (1991) are adopted for this purpose. Analysis of the trimeter sequences yields several points of change. A general explanation for their occurrence appears to be that Euripides varies his use of elision according to the emotional content of his text, i.e., he seems to change the form to support the content and, thus, seems to use elision frequency as a dramatic instrument.", "article_title": "Change-Point Analysis: Elision in Euripides' \"Orestes\"", "authors": [{"given": "Jan G.", "family": "de Gooijer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Economic Statistics, University of Amsterdam", "normalized_name": "University of Amsterdam", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04dkp9463", "GRID": "grid.7177.6"}}]}, {"given": "Nancy M.", "family": "Laan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)", "normalized_name": "Dutch Research Council", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04jsz6e67", "GRID": "grid.420488.2"}}, {"original_name": "Department of Classics, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "University of Amsterdam", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04dkp9463", "GRID": "grid.7177.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
