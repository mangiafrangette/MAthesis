Using a parser that extracts syntactic dependencies and semantic roles we were able to compare different characters of the novel in terms of the semantic roles they tend to occupy. Our data show that there are certain dependencies between the apparent personal traits of a character and his or her positions within the predicate structures. We hope that further research will help us gain more insights into the ‘literary technique’ of Tolstoy and enable us to create a semantic mark-up of his works.", "article_title": "Text miningWar and Peace: Automatic extraction of character traits from literary pieces", "authors": [{"given": " Anastasia", "family": "Bonch-Osmolovskaya", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Research University ‘Higher School of Economics’, Russia", "normalized_name": "National Research University Higher School of Economics", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/055f7t516", "GRID": "grid.410682.9"}}]}, {"given": " Daniil", "family": "Skorinkin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Research University ‘Higher School of Economics’, Russia", "normalized_name": "National Research University Higher School of Economics", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/055f7t516", "GRID": "grid.410682.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
