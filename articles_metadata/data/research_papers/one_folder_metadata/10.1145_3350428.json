Computational simulation allows to reconstruct the daylight illumination of buildings with known geometrical configuration if the scattering properties of window glass can be replicated. We describe a method to generate data-driven models of Roman window glass based on precise gonio-photometric measurements of archaeological finds. The method is employed to model four exemplary glass finds in the context of a simplified architectural scene, demonstrating the potential to support research in building history and archaeology focused on building techniques, lighting concepts, and perception with accurate and reliable photometric data.", "article_title": "Data-Driven Modelling of Daylight Scattering by Roman Window Glass", "authors": [{"given": "Lars Oliver", "family": "Grobe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Technikumstrasse, Horw, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04nd0xd48", "GRID": "grid.425064.1"}}]}, {"given": "Andreas", "family": "Noback", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Technische Universität Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany", "normalized_name": "TU Darmstadt", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05n911h24", "GRID": "grid.6546.1"}}]}, {"given": "Franziska", "family": "Lang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Technische Universität Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany", "normalized_name": "TU Darmstadt", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05n911h24", "GRID": "grid.6546.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2020-02-25", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "13", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
