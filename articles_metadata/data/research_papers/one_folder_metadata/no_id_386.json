The goal of these talks was to identify what practical consequences new computer and Internet based technologies have on research and teaching in the field of Medieval German studies and what requirements different university groups have for the future use of the new media and technologies. The talks deliberately set aside the field of specialist programming or special hardware configurations. The focus was to be on application.
