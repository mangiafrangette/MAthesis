To justify these claims, the authors examine two platforms, ThoughtMesh and Scalar, using methods across digital rhetoric, interaction design, data structuring, and software studies. While the essay is largely intended for audiences interested in digital scholarly communications and platform development, it should also appeal to those invested in linked open data, media studies, and computers and writing.", "article_title": "After the Document Model for Scholarly Communication: Some Considerations for Authoring with Rich Media", "authors": [{"given": "Jentery", "family": "Sayers", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}, {"given": "Craig", "family": "Dietrich", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Southern California", "normalized_name": "University of Southern California", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03taz7m60", "GRID": "grid.42505.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
