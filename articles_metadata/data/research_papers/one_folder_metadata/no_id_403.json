The following article first gives a description of the manuscripts in question and outlines their special character and importance: in 45 years, Jean Paul has written down more than 12000 pages of excerpts, a very curious private encyclopaedia, which he intensively used during the writing of his novels and other texts. In a second part, the article delimits the philological and digital intentions of the edition: it is mainly conceived as a support for future editors of the revised historico-critical edition of Jean Paul's works, who will use it to comment the text and describe the author's writing method. In a third step, the article concentrates upon the digital realisation of the project, especially on the text markup, but also the used markup model designed by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and the software used in different stages of the work (transcription, encoding, retrieval).", "article_title": "DIE ELEKTRONISCHE EDITION VON JEAN PAULS EXZERPTHEFTEN", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Will", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut für Deutsche Philologie der Universität Würzbug", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2002", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
