Conducted analysis extracted three factors within the twelve observed variables and suggests that one of those factors, namely, the Lower part Pitch-Name and Duration factor (LPND), can account for the differences between Mozart’s symphonies and string quartets composed after 1782.", "article_title": "This paper aims to demonstrate that variables relating to the independency of the string parts are useful for discriminating between symphonies and string quartets in terms of their orchestrations.
