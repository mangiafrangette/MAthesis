This paper explores the question of the relevance and further development of semantic technologies in digital editions in the arts and humanities. The XML TEI-based editions of texts can be set on top of established publication structures. However, the widespread use of the TEI standard has led not to the interoperability of editions – despite the intentions of its creator—but rather to the increasingly strong specialization of the markup by discipline. This situation has led to the need for solutions for aggregation, re-usability, and the networking of editions as well as for encoding using a machine-readable semantic – one that is capable of generating other forms of connections using Linked Open Data (LOD), authority files, and other metadata.", "article_title": "Der nächste Schritt?
