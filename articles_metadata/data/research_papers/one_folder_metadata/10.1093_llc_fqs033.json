Although still in the start-up phase, it already is capable of identifying significant numbers of known allusions, as well as similar numbers of allusions previously unnoticed by scholars. In this article, we use the tool to examine allusions to Vergil’s Aeneid in the first book of Lucan’s Civil War. Approximately 3,000 linguistic parallels returned by the program were compared with a list of known allusions drawn from commentaries. Each was examined individually and graded for its literary significance, in order to benchmark the program’s performance. All allusions from the program and commentaries were then pooled in order to examine broad patterns in Lucan’s allusive techniques which were largely unapproachable without digital methods. Although Lucan draws relatively constantly from Vergil’s generic language in order to maintain the epic idiom, this baseline is punctuated by clusters of pointed allusions, in which Lucan frequently subverts Vergil’s original meaning. These clusters not only attend the most significant characters and events but also play a role in structuring scene transitions. Work is under way to incorporate the ability to match on word meaning, phrase context, as well as metrical and phonological features into future versions of the program.", "article_title": "The Tesserae Project: intertextual analysis of Latin poetry", "authors": [{"given": " Neil", "family": "Coffee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Jean-Pierre", "family": "Koenig", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Shakthi", "family": "Poornima", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Christopher W.", "family": "Forstall", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Roelant", "family": "Ossewaarde", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Sarah L.", "family": "Jacobson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
