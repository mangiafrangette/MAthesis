As we build a cyberinfrastructure for Classics in the future, we must explore the role that automatic methods can play within it. Using technologies inherited from the disciplines of computational linguistics and computer science, we can create a complement to these traditional reference works - a dynamic lexicon that presents statistical information about a wordâ€™s usage in context, including information about its sense distribution within various authors, genres and eras, and syntactic information as well.
