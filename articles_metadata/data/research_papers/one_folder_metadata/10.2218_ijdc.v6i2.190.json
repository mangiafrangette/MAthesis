A combination of survey (n=363) and interview data (n=15) yielded both qualitative and quantitative results bearing on my central research question: In what types of data management activities do researchers at this institution engage? Corollary to that, I also explored the following questions: What do researchers feel could be improved about their data management practices? Which services might be of interest to them? How do they feel those services could most effectively be implemented?In this paper, I situate researchers’ data management practices within a theory of personal information management. I present a view of data management and preservation needs from researchers’ perspectives across a range of domains. Additionally, I discuss the implications that understanding research data management as personal information management has for introducing services to support and improve data management practice.", "article_title": "“You made it, you take care of it”: Data Management as Personal Information Management", "authors": [{"given": "Kathleen", "family": "Fear", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information, University of Michigan", "normalized_name": "University of Michigan–Ann Arbor", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00jmfr291", "GRID": "grid.214458.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
