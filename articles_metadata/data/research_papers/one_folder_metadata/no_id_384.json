Crucial arguments in favor of such an edition are first von Arnim's constant interweaving of published books and private correspondances which lent her writings their specific network structure; second the problem of handling the sources, von Arnim's papers partly having disappeared after an auction in 1929 and the rest being scattered wide. To give plausibility to these argu-ments the essay sketches the works' net structure as well as the state of the manuscript sources.", "article_title": "FASELEI ONLINE.
