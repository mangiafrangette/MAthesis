To test their distinctiveness, graphs of other texts, ancient and modern, comprising more than a million words, have been scrutinized; this survey has failed to detect any similar patterns. They may therefore be related to Pauline authorship. The longer passages claimed to be interpolations are tested against these scale‐related patterns and are found to be essential parts of the original texts. Further scale‐related patterns are found in 1 and 2 Peter (which received wisdom claims are pseudonymous writings) and in Hebrews. Consideration of these patterns and of the partnership of Paul and Silvanus in mission, leads to a possible solution to the problem of the hapaxes and throws light on the points of contact between the Paulines (including the Pastorals), 1 and 2 Peter, and Hebrews.", "article_title": "Interpolations, Pseudographs, and the New Testament Epistles", "authors": [{"given": "G.
