Thus it lost its original liturgical role and was used simply as a canvas to demonstrate a more political and social purpose. This paper does not attempt to explain how this came about, but rather to explore the intricacies of this manuscript's new context. Besides dating its later illumination to the years around 1480, largely by identifying and analyzing the heraldic evidence, I argue that the manuscript must be placed within the humanist circle of Lorenzo de' Medici. By investigating the nuanced political atmosphere in Florence and the relations between wealthy, intellectual families of Lorenzo's circle, I furthermore conclude that Filippo Strozzi commissioned the illumination of this manuscript in order to solidify his political relationship with the Medici, to glorify his family, and to prove its devotion to Florence.", "article_title": "The Fisher Antiphonary: A Gilded Window onto the Strozzi and Late Fifteenth-Century Florentine Politics", "authors": [{"given": "Ilana", "family": "Krug", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "York College of Pennsylvania", "normalized_name": "York College of Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ssn3c97", "GRID": "grid.433833.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
