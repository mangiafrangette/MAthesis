As new digital resources and tools are developed, and old tools and resources reinvented for the digital world, the practice of scholarship is quickly adapting to the expectations that content should be accessible from anywhere, that it is a raw material to be manipulated, and that an excess of information is the major challenge facing scholars.

We provide an overview of these projects.
