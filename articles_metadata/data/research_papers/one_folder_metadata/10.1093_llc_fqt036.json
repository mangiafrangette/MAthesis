The corpus of poems used consist of 100 poems randomly selected from a recent anthology of professional poets and a control group of 100 poems written by amateurs. The poems were reduced to ninety-eight linguistic and psycholinguistic variables, and these were used in a machine learning algorithm to build an ensemble classifier. The accuracy of the classifier was 84.5%. The probability scores of the individual poems was then used to rank the professional poems on a continuum representing amateur at one extreme and professional at the other, thereby providing an objective means of ranking contemporary poems.", "article_title": "Ranking contemporary American poems", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Dalvean", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Australian National University", "normalized_name": "Australian National University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/019wvm592", "GRID": "grid.1001.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013-06-29", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "30", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
