Apart from digitization, issues such as methods of sharing historic and linguistic sources in the digital form are covered. These sources include historic and scientific dictionaries of the Polish language, records, and texts dating back to before 1945. Additionally, linguistic corpora of historic Polish are presented, both those completed and those underway. The article emphasizes the imperative to create constellations of linguistic data warehouses. The last part, dedicated to the concept of the platform Diachronic Corpora of Polish, constitutes an attempt to catalog, disseminate, and made public the results of activities pertaining to works on the Polish corpora.", "article_title": "Digital Humanities in Poland from the Perspective of the Historical Linguist of the Polish Language: Achievements, Needs, Demands", "authors": [{"given": " Magdalena", "family": "Pastuch", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Beata", "family": "Duda", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Karolina", "family": "Lisczyk", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Barbara", "family": "Mitrenga", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Joanna", "family": "Przyklenk", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Katarzyna", "family": "Sujkowska-Sobisz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "33", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
