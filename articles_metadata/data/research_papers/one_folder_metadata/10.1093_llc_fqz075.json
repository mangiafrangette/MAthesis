Along with literary brilliance, the text of this book covers the broad topics. This research deals with the application of the statistical text and data analysis to extract knowledge from the aphorisms in Nahj al-Balaghah. First, we classify these aphorisms in seven topics. Then, the count of the aphorisms in each category is computed. Finally, the counts of the aphorisms of the categories are compared using the chi-square test and the cluster analysis.", "article_title": "A statistical view to study the aphorisms in Nahj al-Balaghah", "authors": [{"given": " Yu", "family": "Tian", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "College of Literature, Northwest University, Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China", "normalized_name": "Northwest University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00y7snj24", "GRID": "grid.441153.6"}}]}, {"given": " Kim-Hung", "family": "Pho", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fractional Calculus, Optimization and Algebra Research Group, Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "normalized_name": "Ton Duc Thang University", "country": "Vietnam", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01drq0835", "GRID": "grid.444812.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
