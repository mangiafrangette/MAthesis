This paper considers the dimensions of work, worker, and workplace, including the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for eScience professionals. We used focus groups and interviews to explore the needs of scientific researchers and how these needs may translate into curricular and program development choices. A cohort of five masters students also worked in targeted internship settings and completed internship logs. We organized this evidence into a job analysis that can be used for curriculum and program development at schools of library and information science.", "article_title": "Education for eScience Professionals: Integrating Data Curation and Cyberinfrastructure", "authors": [{"given": "Youngseek", "family": "Kim", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information Studies, Syracuse University", "normalized_name": "Syracuse University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/025r5qe02", "GRID": "grid.264484.8"}}]}, {"given": "Benjamin K.", "family": "Addom", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information Studies, Syracuse University", "normalized_name": "Syracuse University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/025r5qe02", "GRID": "grid.264484.8"}}]}, {"given": "Jeffrey M.", "family": "Stanton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Information Studies, Syracuse University", "normalized_name": "Syracuse University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/025r5qe02", "GRID": "grid.264484.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
