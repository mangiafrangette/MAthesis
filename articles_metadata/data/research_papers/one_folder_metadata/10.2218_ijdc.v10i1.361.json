We review the progress of scientific research into the digital preservation of science over the last decade, emphasising in particular the research and development programme of STFC. We conclude with a number of observations into the future directions of research and also the practical deployment of policy and infrastructure to effectively preserve the scientific memory.", "article_title": "Towards the Preservation of the Scientific Memory", "authors": [{"given": "Brian", "family": "Matthews", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Scientific Computing DepartmentRutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Shirley", "family": "Crompton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Scientific Computing DepartmentDaresbury Laboratory", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Catherine", "family": "Jones", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Scientific Computing DepartmentRutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Simon", "family": "Lambert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "STFC Scientific Computing DepartmentRutherford Appleton Laboratory", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
