Although there exist a few software tools for this purpose, they are restricted to a specific domain (e.g., the Bible) or a specific language (e.g., Hebrew). In this article, we present in detail how we build a digital infrastructure that can facilitate the search and discovery of parallel passages for any domain in any language. It is at the core of our Samtla (Search And Mining Tools with Linguistic Analysis) system designed in collaboration with historians and linguists. The system has already been used to support research on five large text corpora that span a number of different domains and languages. The key to such a domain-independent and language-independent digital infrastructure is a novel combination of a character-based n-gram language model, space-optimized suffix tree, and generalized edit distance. A comprehensive evaluation through crowdsourcing shows that the effectiveness of our systemâ€™s search functionality is on par with the human-level performance.", "article_title": "Finding Parallel Passages in Cultural Heritage Archives", "authors": [{"given": "Martyn", "family": "Harris", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Levene", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Dell", "family": "Zhang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Dan", "family": "Levene", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Southampton University, Southampton, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Southampton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ryk1543", "GRID": "grid.5491.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "11", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
