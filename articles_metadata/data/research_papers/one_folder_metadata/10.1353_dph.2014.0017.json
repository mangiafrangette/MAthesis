The articles in this volume grapple with these dynamics by bringing comparative perspectives to a single manuscript. In this afterword, I seek to make clear some of the pluralities at the heart of encountering the digital, physical, and always contingent Brut. I highlight the complexities of transmission with an example of how one late medieval reader responded not to the text at hand, but rather to his memories or expectations of other histories and other texts.", "article_title": "Encountering the Dartmouth Brut in the Midst of History", "authors": [{"given": "Matthew", "family": "Fisher", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, Los Angeles", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
