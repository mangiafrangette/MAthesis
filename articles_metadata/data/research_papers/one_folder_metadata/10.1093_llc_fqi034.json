The approach to general problems for a diachronic corpus is discussed. Details of the tag set and the tagging system devised are given. The development of a sophisticated automatic mark-up scheme for Chinese texts from widely different time periods and genres is indicated.", "article_title": "Sheffield Corpus of Chinese for Diachronic Linguistic Study1", "authors": [{"given": " Xiaoling", "family": "Hu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Sheffield, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sheffield", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05krs5044", "GRID": "grid.11835.3e"}}]}, {"given": " Nigel", "family": "Williamson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Sheffield, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sheffield", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05krs5044", "GRID": "grid.11835.3e"}}]}, {"given": " Jamie", "family": "McLaughlin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Sheffield, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sheffield", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05krs5044", "GRID": "grid.11835.3e"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2005", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "20", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
