However, Internet-derived data is typically very messy data and a conversion process is often required in order to enable researchers to carry out a reliable quantitative investigation of the patterns observed with the help of standard corpus tools. In this article, I discuss the technical and methodological aspects involved in creating a large corpus of asynchronous computer-mediated communication by downloading and post-processing hundreds of thousands messages posted in twelve Usenet newsgroups. After describing how messages can be arranged into hierarchically structured discussion threads, I focus at some length on the strategies that are required to correctly assign authorship to the different textual elements in individual messages. My algorithms have a success rate of well over 90% for most newsgroups and the resulting corpus can thus serve as a suitable basis for an investigation into the interactive strategies employed in this particular type of written communication.", "article_title": "Processing Internet-derived Text--Creating a Corpus of Usenet Messages", "authors": [{"given": " Sebastian", "family": "Hoffmann", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Linguistics and English Language, Bowland College, Lancaster University", "normalized_name": "Lancaster University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04f2nsd36", "GRID": "grid.9835.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2007-03-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "22", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
