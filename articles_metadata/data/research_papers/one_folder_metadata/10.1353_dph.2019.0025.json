Considering previous contributions on the subject as well as the implementations of stand-off markup, we propose a new TEI-based model for encoding that still uses the regular TEI elements but in a stand-off manner. Our light notation moves the bulk of markup into a separate &lt;standoff&gt; element, grouping layers of related textual features encoded via existing TEI elements (e.g., &lt;name&gt; or &lt;corr&gt;) into individual &lt;stf&gt; elements; furthermore, our proposed notation provides a schema for referencing the transcription using the xml:id attribute. This approach is illustrated through a variety of examples. Our proof-of-concept transformation package works directly on the stand-off markup without the necessity of reducing it back to inline TEI for parsing, querying, and visualizing.", "article_title": "XML-TEI Stand-off Markup: One Step Beyond", "authors": [{"given": "Elena", "family": "Spadini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universit√© de Lausanne", "normalized_name": "University of Lausanne", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/019whta54", "GRID": "grid.9851.5"}}]}, {"given": "Magdalena", "family": "Turska", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "eXist Solutions", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019-10-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
