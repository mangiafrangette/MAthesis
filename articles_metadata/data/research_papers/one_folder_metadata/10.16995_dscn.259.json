First, the uses, benefits and trade-offs of various communication channels are outlined. From there, the application of these various channels within DH research teams and their impact on collaboration will be explored by drawing upon interviews with members of DH teams. Best practices and recommendations for DH research teams and funding agencies will conclude the paper.", "article_title": "The Balance between On-line and In-person Interactions: Methods for the Development of Digital Humanities Collaboration", "authors": [{"given": "Lynne", "family": "Siemens", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Assistant Professor, School of Public Administration, University of Victoria", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-10-19", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
