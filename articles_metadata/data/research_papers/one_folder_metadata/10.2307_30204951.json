We first address reliability problems in language transcriptions, agreement between transcribers, and how disagreements can be dealt with. We then show that the frequencies of occurrence obtained from a corpus cannot always be analyzed with the traditional χ² test, as corpus data are often not sequentially independent and unit independent. Next, we stress the relevance of the power of statistical tests, and the sizes of statistically significant effects. Finally, we point out that a t-test based on log odds often provides a better alternative to a χ² analysis based on frequency counts.", "article_title": "Pitfalls in Corpus Research", "authors": [{"given": "Toni", "family": "Rietveld", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Linguistics, Radboud University Nijmegen, Erasmusplein 1, 6525 HT, Nijmegen, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Radboud University Nijmegen", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/016xsfp80", "GRID": "grid.5590.9"}}]}, {"given": "Roeland", "family": "van Hout", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Linguistics, Radboud University Nijmegen, Erasmusplein 1, 6525 HT, Nijmegen, The Netherlands", "normalized_name": "Radboud University Nijmegen", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/016xsfp80", "GRID": "grid.5590.9"}}]}, {"given": "Mirjam", "family": "Ernestus", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics", "normalized_name": "Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00671me87", "GRID": "grid.419550.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
