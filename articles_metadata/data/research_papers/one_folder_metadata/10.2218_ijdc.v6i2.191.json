Technical developments and a maturing understanding of organisational activity and workflow saw the emphasis move to ensuring the access, use and reuse of digital materials throughout their lifecycle. Digital Curation emerged as a new discipline supported through the activities of the UK’s Digital Curation Centre and a number of EU 6th Framework Projects. Digital Curation is now embedded in both practice and research; with the development of tools, and the foundation of a number of support units and academic educators offering training and furthering research.", "article_title": "Digital Curation: The Emergence of a New Discipline", "authors": [{"given": "Sarah", "family": "Higgins", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Aberystwyth University", "normalized_name": "Aberystwyth University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/015m2p889", "GRID": "grid.8186.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
