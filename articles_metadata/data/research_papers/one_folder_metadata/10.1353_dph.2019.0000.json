After an introductory survey of the known manuscripts, the essay examines in detail the work's diffusion and its translations, as well as its later adaptations. Finally, there is a detailed consideration of tradition, influence, and imitations. In each of these cases, the middle French translation is shown to be particularly important and influential.", "article_title": "The French Translation of the Llibre de l'orde de cavalleria: The Diffusion, Translation, and Adaptation of Ramon Llull's Text", "authors": [{"given": "Florence", "family": "Bouchet", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université Toulouse – Jean Jaurès", "normalized_name": "University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04ezk3x31", "GRID": "grid.410542.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
