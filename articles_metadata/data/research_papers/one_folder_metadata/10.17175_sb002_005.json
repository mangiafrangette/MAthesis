The project results will be a finding aid to the Selbstzeugnisse using autoptic analysis of the manuscripts, a digital critical edition of the diary of Duke August the Younger of Braunschweig-Wolfenbuettel, and the presentation of the project results in a research portal.", "article_title": "Selbstzeugnisse digital – Erschließung, Präsentation und Benutzbarkeit", "authors": [{"given": "Inga Hanna", "family": "Ralle", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2018-03-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Sonderband 2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1366", "type": "electronic"}]}
