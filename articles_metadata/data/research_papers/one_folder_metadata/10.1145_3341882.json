This article reports on the development of a Digital Gesture Library to support cross-cultural appreciation of traditional Chinese puppetry. We describe fieldwork with professional puppeteers to understand their practices and art form, which informed the development of the Digital Gesture Library, which uses a three-perspective archive of puppetry gestures and a tangible interface to support cross-cultural audiencesâ€™ appreciation of puppetry and encourages further exploration of Chinese culture. We present findings on the efficacy of the Digital Gesture Library from qualitative and quantitative user studies and, from this, discuss the opportunities and challenges for developing digital technology for cross-cultural appreciation of intangible heritage.", "article_title": "Supporting the Cross-cultural Appreciation of Traditional Chinese Puppetry Through a Digital Gesture Library", "authors": [{"given": "Shichao", "family": "Zhao", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Open Lab, Newcastle University", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Kirk", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Open Lab, Newcastle University", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}, {"given": "Simon", "family": "Bowen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Open Lab, Newcastle University", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Chatting", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Design, Goldsmiths, University of London", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Peter", "family": "Wright", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Open Lab, Newcastle University", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "12", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
