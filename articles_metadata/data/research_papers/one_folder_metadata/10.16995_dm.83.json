{"identifier": {"string_id": "10.16995/dm.83", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "The task of automatically separating Middle Dutch words into syllables is a challenging one. A first method was presented by Bouma and Hermans (2012), who combined a rule-based finite-state component with data-driven error correction. Achieving an average word accuracy of 96.5%, their system surely is a satisfactory one, although it leaves room for improvement. Generally speaking, rule-based methods are less attractive for dealing with a medieval language like Middle Dutch, where not only each dialect has its own spelling preferences, but where there is also much idiosyncratic variation among scribes. This paper presents a different method for the task of automatically syllabifying Middle Dutch words, which does not rely on a set of pre-defined linguistic information. Using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long-Short-Term Memory cells (LSTM), we obtain a system which outperforms the rule-based method both in robustness and in effort.", "article_title": "Data-Driven Syllabification for Middle Dutch", "authors": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5687-6787", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Wouter", "family": "Haverals", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Antwerp", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}, {"given": "Folgert", "family": "Karsdorp", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Meertens Institute â€“ KNAW", "normalized_name": "Meertens Institute", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05kaxyq51", "GRID": "grid.450081.8"}}]}, {"given": "Mike", "family": "Kestemont", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Antwerp", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "12", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.83"}
