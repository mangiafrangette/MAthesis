Some of the linguistic engineering questions addressed in the paper include the following: How far can linguistic adequacy be maintained in morphological components of marketable machine translation software on the IBM PC platform? What generalizations can be made contributing to the more uniform approach to morphology for languages of various structures? What are the parameters that can be adjusted quantitatively to allow for general model application to different languages? A generalized approach of treating postfixal languages is proposed, which is supplemented by suggestions on its modification for languages that are clearly not postfixal (e.g. Arabic).", "article_title": "Morphological representation in PC-based text processing systems", "authors": [{"given": "S", "family": "Koval", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-10", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
