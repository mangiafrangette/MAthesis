Despite some uncertainty about the interpretation of individual performers on specific dates, scholarship can still inform other factors of greater perceptual importance, leading to a good approximation of historical performances. In addition to performance style and period instruments, computer simulations make it possible to also account for the acoustics of the period performance space. In addition, the most accurate reconstruction should simulate the roomâ€™s acoustics in real time for the performers, thus retaining the feedback mechanisms of room response on performance practice.", "article_title": "Computational acoustic musicology", "authors": [{"given": " Braxton B", "family": "Boren", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Audio Technology, Department of Performing Arts, American University, USA", "normalized_name": "American University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052w4zt36", "GRID": "grid.63124.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
