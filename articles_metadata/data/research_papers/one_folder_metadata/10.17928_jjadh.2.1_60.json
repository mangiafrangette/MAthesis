We analyze the linkage between a university, an academic association, and the practitioners’ institutions closely related with cultural resources through the mining of the principal texts produced by them. Our findings reveal the complicated relations among these stakeholder institutions, and attest to the importance of the revision cycle for the advance of interdisciplinary studies.", "article_title": "Designing Research for Monitoring Humanities-based Interdisciplinary Studies: A Case of Cultural Resources Studies (Bunkashigengaku 文化資源学) in Japan", "authors": [{"given": "Yusuke", "family": "Nakamura", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Chikahiko", "family": "Suzuki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Katsuya", "family": "Masuda", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Center for Research and Development of Higher Education, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Hideki", "family": "Mima", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Center for Research and Development of Higher Education, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2188-7276", "type": "electronic"}]}
