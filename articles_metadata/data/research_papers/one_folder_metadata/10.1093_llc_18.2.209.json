He traces the tools from their origin in the concordance. He argues that text‐analysis tools produce new texts generated from queries through processes implemented on the computer. These new texts come from the decomposition of original texts and recomposition into hybrid new works for interpretation. The author ends by presenting a portal model for how text‐analysis tools can be made available to the community.", "article_title": "What is Text Analysis, Really?", "authors": [{"given": "G.", "family": "Rockwell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2003", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "18", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
