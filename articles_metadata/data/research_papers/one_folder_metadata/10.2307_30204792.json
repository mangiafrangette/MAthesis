In order to do this, it was necessary to provide a 'gold standard' dataset of 'correct' answers. This paper will describe the lexicographic part of the process involved in creating that dataset. The primary objective was for a group of lexicographers to manually examine keywords in a large number of corpus contexts, and assign to each context a sense-tag for the keyword, taken from the Hector dictionary. Corpus contexts also had to be manually part-of-speech (POS) tagged. Various observations made and insights gained by the lexicographers during this process will be presented, including a critique of the resources and the methodology.", "article_title": "Peeling an Onion: The Lexicographer's Experience of Manual Sense-Tagging", "authors": [{"given": "Ramesh", "family": "Krishnamurthy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Diane", "family": "Nicholls", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
