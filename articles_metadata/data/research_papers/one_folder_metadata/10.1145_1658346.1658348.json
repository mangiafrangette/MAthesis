Several methods for character segmentation and recognition stages are investigated. In particular, sliding-window and histogram segmentation methods are coupled with recognition approaches using spatial features, neural networks, and a graph-based model. The prototype system provides CBR of document images using both example-based queries and a virtual keyboard to construct query words.", "article_title": "Ottoman archives explorer", "authors": [{"given": "Ismet Zeki", "family": "Yalniz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey", "normalized_name": "Bilkent University", "country": "Turkey", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02vh8a032", "GRID": "grid.18376.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Ismail Sengor", "family": "Altingovde", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey", "normalized_name": "Bilkent University", "country": "Turkey", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02vh8a032", "GRID": "grid.18376.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Uğur", "family": "Güdükbay", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey", "normalized_name": "Bilkent University", "country": "Turkey", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02vh8a032", "GRID": "grid.18376.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Özgür", "family": "Ulusoy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey", "normalized_name": "Bilkent University", "country": "Turkey", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02vh8a032", "GRID": "grid.18376.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2010-01-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "2", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
