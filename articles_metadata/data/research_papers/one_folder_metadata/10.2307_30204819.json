The work of the Centre was grounded in humanities computing, a subject area which itself has developed over time. The article compares earlier observations made by Joseph Raben and Susan Hockey about the integration of resources within humanities teaching and learning, to current realities. Its focus is the development of access to distributed resources, beginning with an interface between the early PC and the mainframe and ending with a vision of a humanities portal to distributed resources.", "article_title": "From Concordances to Subject Portals: Supporting the Text-Centred Humanities Community", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Fraser", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humanities Computing Unit, Oxford", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
