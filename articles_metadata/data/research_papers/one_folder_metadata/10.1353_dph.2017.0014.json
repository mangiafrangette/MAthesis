This effect is demonstrated with reference to the Bern Parzival Project, which captures Wolfram von Eschenbach's romance (ca. 1200) in its rich manuscript transmission. Various components of the electronic edition, including a synopsis of different textual versions, single manuscript transcriptions, and unrooted phylograms borrowed from microbiology for the purpose of documenting witness relationships are discussed here in the context of theoretical issues situated on the boundaries between the sciences and the humanities.", "article_title": "Copying, Emergence, and Digital Reproduction: Transferring Medieval Manuscript Culture into an Electronic Edition", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Stolz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universit√§t Bern", "normalized_name": "University of Bern", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02k7v4d05", "GRID": "grid.5734.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2018-04-08", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
