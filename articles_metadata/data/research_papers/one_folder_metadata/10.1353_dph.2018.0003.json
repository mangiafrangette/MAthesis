Focussing on transcription, collation, and regularization, I propose a model for their effective completion by more than one person. Finally, I consider if collaborative digital editing might be a misnomer in this context: what do we mean by collaborative and editing in the collaborative digital editing of medieval texts?", "article_title": "The Practicalities of Collaboratively Digitally Editing Medieval Prose: The Estoria de Espanna Digital Project as a Case Study", "authors": [{"given": "Polly", "family": "Duxfield", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Birmingham", "normalized_name": "University of Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03angcq70", "GRID": "grid.6572.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2018-08-12", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
