We specifically address our decision to use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), not TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), as our encoding language. An argument is provided as to why TEI is unsuitable for function-based documents, this addresses both source integrity and the restrictive nature of TEI. TEI does not support our forward engineering approach, which allows us to simultaneously produce the model, the encoding and the software environment.", "article_title": "A Digital Edition of a Spanish 18th Century Account Book: Formalisation and Encoding", "authors": [{"given": "John G", "family": "Keating", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "An Foras Feasa, National University of Ireland, Maynooth", "normalized_name": "National University of Ireland", "country": "Ireland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00shsf120", "GRID": "grid.9344.a"}}]}, {"given": "Thomas", "family": "O’Connor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "An Foras Feasa, National University of Ireland, Maynooth", "normalized_name": "National University of Ireland", "country": "Ireland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00shsf120", "GRID": "grid.9344.a"}}]}, {"given": "Aja", "family": "Teehan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "An Foras Feasa, National University of Ireland, Maynooth", "normalized_name": "National University of Ireland", "country": "Ireland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00shsf120", "GRID": "grid.9344.a"}}]}, {"given": "Damien", "family": "Gallagher", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "An Foras Feasa, National University of Ireland, Maynooth", "normalized_name": "National University of Ireland", "country": "Ireland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00shsf120", "GRID": "grid.9344.a"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
