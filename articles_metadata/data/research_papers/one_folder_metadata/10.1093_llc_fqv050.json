These DH projects involve undergraduates working with faculty on an unfolding expansive research project that affords otherwise unachievable opportunities for undergraduate student engagement, the development of new skills, and meaningful ongoing interaction between the institution and community that have, in turn, furthered the scope and scale of the project.", "article_title": "Digital Learning in an Undergraduate Context: Promoting Long-Term Studentâ€“Faculty Place-Based Collaboration", "authors": [{"given": " Katherine M.", "family": "Faull", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bucknell University, USA", "normalized_name": "Bucknell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fc1qt65", "GRID": "grid.253363.2"}}]}, {"given": " Diane K.", "family": "Jakacki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bucknell University, USA", "normalized_name": "Bucknell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fc1qt65", "GRID": "grid.253363.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
