To this end, we avoid a strictly technical presentation of the TEI and concentrate on the actual issues that such projects face, with a parallel investigation of the situation within two institutions. While a quick walkthrough the TEI technical framework is provided, the paper concludes by showing the essential role played by the TEI community in providing technical and practical advice.", "article_title": "Questions & Answers for TEI Newcomers ", "authors": [{"given": "Laurent", "family": "Romary", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch f√ºr Computerphilologie", "volume": "10", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
