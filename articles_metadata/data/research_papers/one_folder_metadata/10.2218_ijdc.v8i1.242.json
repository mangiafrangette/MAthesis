As part of a curriculum development project funded by the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services, a total of 173 job advertisements posted between October 2011 and April 2012 were collected from various sources to take into account varying types of professionals in the field of digital curation across North America. Position title, institution types and location, educational background, experience, knowledge and skills, and duties were examined and analyzed. The results of the analysis show that digital curation jobs are characterized by a complex interplay of various skills and knowledge. The findings of this study present emerging requirements for a qualified workforce in the field of digital curation.", "article_title": "Competencies Required for Digital Curation: An Analysis of Job Advertisements", "authors": [{"given": "Jeonghyun", "family": "Kim", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of North Texas", "normalized_name": "University of North Texas", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00v97ad02", "GRID": "grid.266869.5"}}]}, {"given": "Edward", "family": "Warga", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of North Texas", "normalized_name": "University of North Texas", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00v97ad02", "GRID": "grid.266869.5"}}]}, {"given": "William", "family": "Moen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of North Texas", "normalized_name": "University of North Texas", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00v97ad02", "GRID": "grid.266869.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
