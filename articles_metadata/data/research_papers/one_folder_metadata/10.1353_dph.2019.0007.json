However, this essay focuses on the works of one of the king's preeminent translators Nicole Oresme, more from the cultural standpoint of the translator than the king's political one. Oresme's scholastic and cultural background helps understanding how translating was an all-encompassing complex intellectual process for him and that any of the political stands that arose from his process reflected personal philosophical beliefs and worldview.", "article_title": "Nicole Oresme's Cultural Translatio in Question", "authors": [{"given": "Anne-Hélène", "family": "Miller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Tennessee- Knoxville", "normalized_name": "University of Tennessee at Knoxville", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/020f3ap87", "GRID": "grid.411461.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019-05-19", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
