However, the most radical critique of these methods has, under the umbrella term ‘theory’, emerged since the 1960s in the writings of Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida. Thanks to their influence, authorship attribution is now distinguished from authorship ascription with only the latter applying to literary and linguistic computing.
