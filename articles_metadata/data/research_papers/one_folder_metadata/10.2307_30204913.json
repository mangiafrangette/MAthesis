It is not simply a string matching program - instead it uses predicate argument structure, pronominal reference, morphological analysis and synonyms to assign full or partial credit to a short answer question. C-rater has been used in two studies: National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) and a statewide assessment in Indiana. In both studies, c-rater agreed with human graders about 84% of the time.", "article_title": "C-rater: Automated Scoring of Short-Answer Questions", "authors": [{"given": "Claudia", "family": "Leacock", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Educational Testing Service, Rosedale Road, 18-E, Princeton, NJ 08541, USA", "normalized_name": "Educational Testing Service", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03b5q4637", "GRID": "grid.286674.9"}}]}, {"given": "Martin", "family": "Chodorow", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Hunter College, City University of New York, USA", "normalized_name": "City University of New York", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00453a208", "GRID": "grid.212340.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2003", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "37", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
