Drawing a syntax tree involves the depiction of a rooted tree with additional syntactic features using specific domain conventions. TreeForm assists users in developing syntax trees, complete with movement lines, coreference, and feature association, in order to explore their syntactic theories and explain them to their colleagues. It is a drag-and-drop alternative to LaTeX and labelled bracket notation tools already available, which many linguists find difficult to use. We compare the output of TreeForm to those existing tools and show that it is able to better respect the conventions of the domain. We assess how easily linguists learn to use TreeForm through a series of cognitive walkthroughs. Our reviews find that TreeForm is a viable alternative to existing tools.", "article_title": "TreeForm: Explaining and exploring grammar through syntax trees", "authors": [{"given": " Donald", "family": "Derrick", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of British Columbia", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rmrcq20", "GRID": "grid.17091.3e"}}]}, {"given": " Daniel", "family": "Archambault", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "25", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
