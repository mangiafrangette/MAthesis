As a 3D acquisition device returns an agglomeration of elementary objects (e.g. a laser scanner returns points), the model acquisition pipeline always starts with a composition of primitives. Due to the semantic information carried with a generative description, a procedural model provides valuable metadata that make up the basis for digital library services: retrieval, indexing, and searching.An important challenge in computer graphics in the field of cultural heritage is to build a bridge between the generative and the explicit geometry description combining both worldsâ€”the accuracy and systematics of generative models with the realism and the irregularity of real-world data. A first step towards a semantically enriched data description is a reconstruction algorithm based on decreasing exponential fitting. This approach is robust towards outliers and multiple dataset mixtures. It does not need a preceding segmentation and is able to fit a generative shape template to a point cloud identifying the parameters of a shape.", "article_title": "Semantic fitting and reconstruction", "authors": [{"given": "Torsten", "family": "Ullrich", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Technical University Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Volker", "family": "Settgast", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Technical University Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Dieter W.", "family": "Fellner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Research and Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany", "normalized_name": "Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04gmsar03", "GRID": "grid.461618.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
