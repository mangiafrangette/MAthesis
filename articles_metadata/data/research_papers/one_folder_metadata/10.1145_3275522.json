We introduce a new design by combining the multi-projection mapping technology with an optical see-through display that overcomes the limitations of the conventional projection-based exhibition by resolving the problems of ambient light and the occlusion by obstacles. We also introduce a mechanically moving projection surface that increases the degree of freedom of the projection content. Both geometric and radiometric calibration methods are used to correctly project a high-quality texture onto the moving 3D projection surface without perspective distortion. To evaluate the strength of the system and a potential for deployment in a general museum context, we conduct a user study that includes both the visitors and museum staff. The result shows that the proposed system can enrich the museum exhibition by creating a virtual cultural object with substantial 3D effect and high-fidelity appearance. We also demonstrate various applications of the system that provide dynamic content of a virtual cultural object by changing its appearance as well as the viewpoint.", "article_title": "A New Projection-based Exhibition System for a Museum", "authors": [{"given": "Yong Yi", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Republic of Korea", "normalized_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024kbgz78", "GRID": "grid.61221.36"}}]}, {"given": "Jong Hun", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Republic of Korea", "normalized_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024kbgz78", "GRID": "grid.61221.36"}}]}, {"given": "Bilal", "family": "Ahmed", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Republic of Korea", "normalized_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024kbgz78", "GRID": "grid.61221.36"}}]}, {"given": "Moon Gu", "family": "Son", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Republic of Korea", "normalized_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024kbgz78", "GRID": "grid.61221.36"}}]}, {"given": "Kwan H.", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Republic of Korea", "normalized_name": "Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024kbgz78", "GRID": "grid.61221.36"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2019-05-08", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "12", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
