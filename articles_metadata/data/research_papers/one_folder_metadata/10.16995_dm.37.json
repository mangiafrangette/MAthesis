The fact is that the access to these private documents is not always so easy and, in some cases, the preservation of the records cannot be assured. Therefore, our project focuses on creating two online databases that may allow the consultation and use of the documents for research purposes. The databases have been designed to provide a description of each document to which is associated a digital reproduction of the document easier to read on screen.", "article_title": "The ARQUIBANC Project: Location, Recovery, Arrangement, and Dissemination of Catalan Private Archives and Documents", "authors": [{"given": "Elena", "family": "Cantarell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Barcelona", "normalized_name": "University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/021018s57", "GRID": "grid.5841.8"}}]}, {"given": "Mireia", "family": "Comas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Barcelona", "normalized_name": "University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/021018s57", "GRID": "grid.5841.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "7", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.37"}
