It was selected as a suitable tradition for a blind study to test the application of computer-based phylogenetic methods to the stemmatic analysis of manuscript relationships. Our results show that these methods—maximum parsimony, NeighborNet and the Supernetwork algorithm—are capable of producing stemmata in very close agreement with those produced by traditional stemmatic analysis, including the identification of texts that change exemplar in the course of copying. The phylogenetic methods can correctly indicate the affiliations both before and after the point of exemplar change. The maximum chi-squared method (developed to detect recombination in DNA sequences) is able to indicate the region of exemplar change, allowing the precise location to be ascertained by textual analysis.", "article_title": "Dante's Monarchia as a test case for the use of phylogenetic methods in stemmatic analysis", "authors": [{"given": " Heather F.", "family": "Windram", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}]}, {"given": " Prue", "family": "Shaw", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Italian, University College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "University College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895", "GRID": "grid.83440.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Peter", "family": "Robinson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Textual Scholarship and Electronic Editing, Graduate Institute of Theology and Religion, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03angcq70", "GRID": "grid.6572.6"}}]}, {"given": " Christopher J.", "family": "Howe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
