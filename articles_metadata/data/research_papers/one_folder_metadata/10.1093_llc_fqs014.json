In this investigation, we try to make an author discrimination between the Quran (The holy words and statements of God in the Islamic religion) and the Hadith (statements said by the prophet Muhammad). The Quran is taken in its entirety, whereas for the Prophetâ€™s statements, we chose only the certified texts of the Bukhari book. Thus, three series of experiments are done and commented on. The first series of experiments analyses the two books in a global form (the text of every book is analyzed as a unique big text). It concerns nine different experiments. The second series of experiments analyses the two books in a segmental form (four different segments of text are extracted from every book). It concerns five different experiments. The third series of experiments makes an automatic authorship attribution of the two books in a segmental form by employing several classifiers and several types of features. The sizes of the segments are more or less in the same range (four different text segments, with approximately the same size, are extracted from every book). It concerns two different experiments. This investigation sheds light on an old enigma, which has not been solved for 14 centuries: in fact, all the results of this investigation have shown that the two books should have two different authors.", "article_title": "Author discrimination between the Holy Quran and Prophet's statements", "authors": [{"given": " Halim", "family": "Sayoud", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Electronics and Informatics, USTHB University, Algiers, Algeria", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2012-05-12", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "27", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
