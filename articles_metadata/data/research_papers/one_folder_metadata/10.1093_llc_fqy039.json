The method was invented by John Burrows, but it is currently used in an adapted form developed by Hugh Craig. This article demonstrates that the method has not been adapted into its simplest form, thereby obscuring a true understanding of what it does. The article proposes an improvement to the method, which makes it easier to implement and may also help to improve researchers’ understanding of it, without affecting the results of Zeta tests already completed.", "article_title": "An improvement to Zeta", "authors": [{"given": " Pervez", "family": "Rizvi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Independent student", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-09-07", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
