In the study of writers' drafts as in artists' sketches, the different kinds of papers used provide valuable information on the genesis of a work of art and watermarks, when they exist, are the best visible hint allowing us to identify paper. A multimedia database, with digitized images more precise than usual traced design, seems to be appropriate to register, visualize, and compare modern watermarked papers. Besides its usefulness for specialists, such a database bearing on modern manuscripts should also be conceived in a didactic perspective, as it is oriented towards literary scholars who are not particularly familiar with the history of modern paper. In this paper we present the database Profil which includes a set of digitized images from a collection of betagraphies made by the reproduction service of the National French Library. Then we explain problems of database normalization when human sciences are involved.", "article_title": "Profil: An Iconographic Database for Modern Watermarked Papers", "authors": [{"given": "Brigitte", "family": "de la Passardière", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université Paris VI-LIP6", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Claire", "family": "Bustarret", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CNRS-ITEM, France", "normalized_name": "French National Centre for Scientific Research", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02feahw73", "GRID": "grid.4444.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2002-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "36", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
