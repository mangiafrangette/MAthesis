After a general outline of our approach, we present two formal models of transcription. The first addresses only the very simplest cases, the second addresses some but not all of the gaps in the first. Finally, we mention some less simple cases and discuss some elaborations of the model which we hope to develop in future work.", "article_title": "What is transcription?", "authors": [{"given": " Claus", "family": "Huitfeldt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Philosophy, University of Bergen, Norway", "normalized_name": "University of Bergen", "country": "Norway", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03zga2b32", "GRID": "grid.7914.b"}}]}, {"given": " C.
