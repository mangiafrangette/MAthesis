In this article, I address this issue by introducing a geometric interpretation of Delta, which further allows us to interpret Delta as a probabilistic ranking principle. This interpretation gives us a better understanding of the method's fundamental assumptions and potential limitations, as well as leading to several well-founded variations and extensions.", "article_title": "Interpreting Burrows's Delta: Geometric and Probabilistic Foundations", "authors": [{"given": " Shlomo", "family": "Argamon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago", "normalized_name": "Illinois Institute of Technology", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/037t3ry66", "GRID": "grid.62813.3e"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2008-03-02", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
