The paper also investigates if we can answer questions related to the phoneme theory and practice in Berzsenyi’s poems, which obviously cannot be examined by traditional close reading methods.", "article_title": "The Reading Machine", "authors": [{"given": "Labádi", "family": "Gergely", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Szeged", "normalized_name": "University of Szeged", "country": "Hungary", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01pnej532", "GRID": "grid.9008.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE)", "date": "2018", "keywords": ["Dániel Berzseny, R, Magyarlanc, topic modelling, distant reading"], "journal_title": "Digitális Bölcsészet", "volume": "1", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2630-9696", "type": "electronic"}]}
