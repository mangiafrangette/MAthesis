It is divided into eight Parts: I:1791-1797, II:1798-1803, III:1804-09, IV:1810-15, V:1816-21, VI:1822-27, VII:1828-33, VIII:1833-39. Currently Parts I and II have been completely edited and made available to the public. These letters capture a set of intellectual, amicable, and financial relationships established while Southey lived in and traveled away from his home base of Bristol in “the West Country,” before he actually moved to the Lake District. Because each person and place name in the letters was encoded using TEI P5, we have been able to create a data set that indicates who is mentioned in letters to whom. That data set was fed into a Directed and Undirected Graph to be visualized, which is available to see and manipulate online here (http://dhhub.org/demos/voyeur/).", "article_title": "How to Read a Literary Visualisation: Network Effects in the Lake School of Romantic Poetry", "authors": [{"given": "Laura", "family": "Mandell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Miami University", "normalized_name": "Miami University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05nbqxr67", "GRID": "grid.259956.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-10-19", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
