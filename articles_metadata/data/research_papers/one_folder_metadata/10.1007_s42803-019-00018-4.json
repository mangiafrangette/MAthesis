Following Van Hulle and Eggert, the author argues that in the digital medium these traditionally distinct activities now find the space they need to complement and reinforce one another. By critically examining some of the early and more recent theorists and adaptors of this relatively new medium, the essay aims to shed a clearer light on some of its strengths and pitfalls. To conclude, the essay takes the discussion further by offering a broader reflection on the difficulties of providing a ‘definitive’ archival base transcription of especially handwritten materials, questioning if this should be something to aspire to for the edition in the first place.", "article_title": "On edited archives and archived editions", "authors": [{"given": "Wout", "family": "Dillen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Manuscript Genetics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium", "normalized_name": "University of Antwerp", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/008x57b05", "GRID": "grid.5284.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
