First, the fundamental characteristics of digital research data in the humanities are examined. In addition to file-based research data – such as texts, images, videos, and so on – complex data structures become more prominent and pose new challenges for institutions working with research (data) infrastructures. Next, this paper describes the results of the test ingests using three types of research data – database, digital edition, and interactive visualisation – that were carried out during the design phase of the Humanities Data Centre (HDC), followed by a discussion of their implications for the HDC’s initial modular service portfolio, which could be expanded in the future in coordination with other research data centres. This article reflects the developments in the HDC project as of January 2016.
