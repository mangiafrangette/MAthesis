Recently, using statistics and data mining has sought to be exploited in many research fields. In this study, it was demonstrated that how statistics can be applied to literary studies. First, all the lines in Khaghani’s divan are classified and coded into three categories (mystical, non-mystical, and borderline). Then a set of chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are used to investigate and compare the frequency of different line’s categories for all lines and all odes, separately. Finally, the chi-square independence test (crosstabs) is employed to investigate the existence of trend in the lines.", "article_title": "How statistics and text mining can be applied to literary studies?", "authors": [{"given": " Mohammad Reza", "family": "Mahmoudi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, Fasa University, Iran", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Ali", "family": "Abbasalizadeh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Persian Literature, Fasa University, Iran", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-10-24", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
