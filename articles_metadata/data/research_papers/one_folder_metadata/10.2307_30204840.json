Here we consider the \"evolutionary chain problem\": this is the problem of computing a chain of all \"motif\" recurrences, each of which is a transformation of (\"similar\" to) the original motif, but each of which is progressively further from the original. Here we consider several variants of the evolutionary chain problem and we present efficient algorithms for solving them.", "article_title": "Approximate Musical Evolution", "authors": [{"given": "Tim", "family": "Crawford", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Music Department, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Costas S.", "family": "Iliopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Russel", "family": "Winder", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Haifeng", "family": "Yu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
