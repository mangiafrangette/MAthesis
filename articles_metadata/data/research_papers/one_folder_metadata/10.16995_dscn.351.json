In this article, the researchers put forward a meticulous genetic study of the three “Nouvelles Esquimaudes,” which takes the “Voyage en Ungava,” a travel journal written by Gabrielle Roy in 1961 in Fort Chimo, as its starting point. The authors highlight the novelist’s work methods, notably her horizontal and vertical rewriting.
