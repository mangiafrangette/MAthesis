In reference to the 5th anniversary review of the OAIS, it is timely to consider how it may be interpreted by an institutional repository. The paper examines methods of sharing essential functions and requirements of an OAIS between two or more institutions, outlining the practical considerations of outsourcing. It also details the approach taken by the SHERPA DP Project to introduce a disaggregated service model for institutional repositories that wish to implement preservation services.", "article_title": "Modelling OAIS Compliance for Disaggregated Preservation Services", "authors": [{"given": "Gareth", "family": "Knight", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SHERPA DP Project, AHDS Executive", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Hedges", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "SHERPA DP Project, AHDS Executive", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
