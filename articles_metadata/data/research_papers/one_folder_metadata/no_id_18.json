Since the eighteenth century the main argument against their inclusion in the canon has been based on critical taste rather than exhaustive textual examination. However, the use of a computer KWIC program coupled with a search engine like Google shows a significant amount of verbal parallels and very rare word strings shared exclusively between the Shakespeare canonical plays and The Yorkshire Tragedy, The London Prodigal, Lord Cromwell, and The Puritan, which is consistent with tests carried out on texts from the canon.", "article_title": "The Shakespeare Apocrypha in the Time of Google", "authors": [{"given": "Jos√© Luis", "family": "Madrigal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate Center, City University of New York", "normalized_name": "City University of New York", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00453a208", "GRID": "grid.212340.6"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": ["Shakespeare Apocrypha, idiolect, Linguistic individuation, stylometry"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
