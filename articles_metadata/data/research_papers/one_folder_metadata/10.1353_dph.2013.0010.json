By reading three sample poems (in both textual and paratextual dimensions) as “circuits of power,” we will be able to unpick the manoeuvrings of the agents contributing to a given book’s production and reception; to re-assess the framework of power relations in patronage as fulfilling a productive rather than a regulatory role; and to question more fully what constitutes authority and identity, in its various and multi-faceted forms in premodern literary practice.", "article_title": "Circuits of Power: A Model for Rereading Poet-Patron Relations in Late-Medieval Defences of Women", "authors": [{"given": "Helen", "family": "Swift", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "St Hilda’s College", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "University of Oxford", "normalized_name": "University of Oxford", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052gg0110", "GRID": "grid.4991.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "2", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
