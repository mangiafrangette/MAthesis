As the amount of text or speech that is available from a given user of the language typically varies greatly, and the sample sizes tend to be small, the most straightforward methods do not always give the most informative answers. Bootstrap and Bayesian methods provide techniques for handling the uncertainty in small samples. We describe these techniques for estimating frequencies from small samples, and show how they can be applied to the study of linguistic change. As a test case, we use the introduction of the pronoun you as subject in the data provided by the Corpus of Early English Correspondence (c. 1410â€“1681).", "article_title": "How to Handle Small Samples: Bootstrap and Bayesian Methods in the Analysis of Linguistic Change", "authors": [{"given": " Alexander", "family": "Hinneburg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Informatics, Martin-Luther University, Halle/Saal, Germany", "normalized_name": "Luther University", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/015dhy417", "GRID": "grid.444157.7"}}]}, {"given": " Heikki", "family": "Mannila", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "HIIT Basic Research Unit, University of Helsinki", "normalized_name": "University of Helsinki", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/040af2s02", "GRID": "grid.7737.4"}}, {"original_name": "Helsinki University of Technology, Finland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Samuli", "family": "Kaislaniemi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Helsinki, Finland", "normalized_name": "University of Helsinki", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/040af2s02", "GRID": "grid.7737.4"}}]}, {"given": " Terttu", "family": "Nevalainen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Helsinki, Finland", "normalized_name": "University of Helsinki", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/040af2s02", "GRID": "grid.7737.4"}}]}, {"given": " Helena", "family": "Raumolin-Brunberg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Helsinki, Finland", "normalized_name": "University of Helsinki", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/040af2s02", "GRID": "grid.7737.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2007", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "22", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
