Although these three methods have been basic tactics for sharing corpora, they have a conceptual flaw in terms of descriptive linguistics. In this paper we report the results of a previous project - the LingDy project, and propose a basic concept for corpus sharing strategy to support personal diachronic data sharing. This paper is a revised version of a handout at JADH2012, so readers should be careful that this content is based on results at the time of 2012.", "article_title": "Corpus Sharing Strategy for Descriptive Linguistics", "authors": [{"given": "Kazushi", "family": "Ohya", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tsurumi University", "normalized_name": "Tsurumi University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04j8wth34", "GRID": "grid.412816.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "date": "2015-09-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2188-7276", "type": "electronic"}]}
