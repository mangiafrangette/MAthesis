Probably there has to be a return on investment, in terms of time and obviously in terms of educational results, which justifies that commitment. After surveying the particular features of two experimental projects based on networked collaborative learning, the paper will then offer a series of thoughts triggered by observation of the results and the dynamics generated by this specific approach. The purpose of these thoughts is to identify some key factors that make it possible to measure the real added value produced by network collaboration in terms of the acquisition of skills, knowledge, methods and attitudes that go beyond the \"mere\" learning of contents (however fundamental this may be). And it is precisely on the basis of these considerations that teachers usually answer the above question, explaining \"who (or what) made them do it!\".", "article_title": "Networked Collaborative Learning in the Study of Modern History and Literature", "authors": [{"given": "Guglielmo", "family": "Trentin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Institute for Educational Technology, Italian National Research Council, Via De Marini 6, 16149 Genova, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
