It exposes to the end users modern Web-based tools relying on a sophisticated infrastructure to collect, enrich, annotate, and search through large document corpora. Supporting researchers in their daily work is a novel concern for infrastructures. We describe how we gathered requirements through multiple methods to understand historians’ needs and derive an abstract workflow to support them. We then outline the tools that we have built, tying their technical descriptions to the user requirements. The main tools are the note-taking environment and its faceted search capabilities; the data integration platform including the Data API, supporting semantic enrichment through entity recognition; and the environment supporting the software development processes throughout the project to keep both technical partners and researchers in the loop. The outcomes are technical together with new resources developed and gathered, and the research workflow that has been described and documented.", "article_title": "The CENDARI Infrastructure", "authors": [{"given": "Nadia", "family": "Boukhelifa", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "INRA, Thiverval-Grignon, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Mike", "family": "Bryant", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King’s College London, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Nataša", "family": "Bulatović", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Max Planck Digital Library", "normalized_name": "Max Planck Digital Library", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0061msm67", "GRID": "grid.431460.4"}}]}, {"given": "Ivan", "family": "Čukić", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia", "normalized_name": "University of Belgrade", "country": "Serbia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02qsmb048", "GRID": "grid.7149.b"}}]}, {"given": "Jean-Daniel", "family": "Fekete", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "INRIA, ORSAY Cedex, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Milica", "family": "Knežević", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Belgrade, Serbia", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Jörg", "family": "Lehmann", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Faculty of Humanities, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Bern", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02k7v4d05", "GRID": "grid.5734.5"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Stuart", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King’s College London, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Carsten", "family": "Thiel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany", "normalized_name": "University of Göttingen", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01y9bpm73", "GRID": "grid.7450.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2018-04-13", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "11", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
