Guided by a strategy of collaboration and iteration, the Library of Congress began the formation of a national network of partners dedicated to collecting and preserving important born-digital information. Over the last six years, the Library and its partners have been engaged in learning through action that has resulted in an evolving understanding of the most appropriate roles and functions for a national network of diverse stakeholders. The emerging network is complex and inclusive of a variety of stakeholders; content producers, content stewards and service providers from the public and private sectors. Lessons learned indicate that interoperability is a challenge in all aspects of collaborative work.", "article_title": "Evolving a Network of Networks: The Experience of Partnerships in the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program", "authors": [{"given": "Martha", "family": "Anderson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Library of Congress", "normalized_name": "Library of Congress", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04p405e02", "GRID": "grid.241525.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
