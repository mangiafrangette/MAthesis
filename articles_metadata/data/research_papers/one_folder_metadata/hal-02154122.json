However, when dealing with old sources like manuscripts written in scripta continua, antiquity epigraphy or Middle Age manuscripts, (1) such markers are mostly absent, (2) spelling variation and rich morphology make dictionary based approaches difficult. Applying convolutional encoding to characters followed by linear categorization to word-boundary or in-word-sequence is shown to be effective at tokenizing such inputs. Additionally, the software is released with a simple interface for tokenizing a corpus or generating a training set.", "article_title": "Evaluating Deep Learning Methods for Word Segmentation of Scripta Continua Texts in Old French and Latin", "authors": [{"given": "Thibault", "family": "Clérice", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "PSL - Université Paris sciences et lettres", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "ENC - École nationale des chartes", "normalized_name": "École Nationale des Chartes", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013xvg556", "GRID": "grid.462175.3"}}, {"original_name": "CJM - Centre Jean Mabillon", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "HiSoMA - Histoire et Sources des Mondes antiques", "normalized_name": "Histoire et Sources des Mondes Antiques", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01yx7av22", "GRID": "grid.463934.f"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2020", "keywords": ["convolutional network", "scripta continua", "tokenization", "Old French", "word segmentation"], "journal_title": "Journal of Data Mining & Digital Humanities", "volume": "2020", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
