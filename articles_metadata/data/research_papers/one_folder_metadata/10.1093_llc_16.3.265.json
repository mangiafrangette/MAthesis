To use parsed results in the application systems, the parser should be efficient without losing accuracy. In this paper, we present a method for Korean dependency analysis using three types of chunking and lexical co–occurrences extracted from a large corpus. The chunking, which is crucial for reducing disambiguation decisions in the parsing process, is conducted using a finite state transducer and lexical collocation. In addition, lexical information has a great impact on parsing for a free-ordered language such as Korean, as the lexical association is more important than the word order in analysing such languages. The parser that we propose is a hybrid system directed by statistical data and syntactic rules, and based on right–to–left analysis to effectively treat sentences in Korean, which is a head final language. Experiments show that the method is very effective in that it gives accuracy as well as efficiency by reducing irrelevant parsing decisions.", "article_title": "Efficient dependency analysis for Korean sentences based on lexical association and multi-layered chunking", "authors": [{"given": " Juntae", "family": "Yoon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Daumsoft Inc.Seoul, South Korea", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
