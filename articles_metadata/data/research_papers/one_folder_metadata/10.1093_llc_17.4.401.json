Nevertheless, it is shown that automated text categorization techniques can exploit combinations of simple lexical and syntactic features to infer the gender of the author of an unseen formal written document with approximately 80 per cent accuracy. The same techniques can be used to determine if a document is fiction or non‚Äêfiction with approximately 98 per cent accuracy.", "article_title": "Automatically Categorizing Written Texts by Author Gender", "authors": [{"given": "M.", "family": "Koppel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2002", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "17", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
