This integrated finding guide to Whitman's poetry manuscripts includes item-level description, links to repository guides that provide both location information and collection context, links to digital images of the manuscripts, and links to Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) transcriptions. In creating such a guide, we had to work cooperatively across disciplines and institutions, expand the use of EAD, and address how best to integrate description and transcription (EAD and TEI files). This essay describes our procedure as we created the integrated guide. From collecting finding aids and creating partnerships with other institutions, to developing a proper encoding standard and establishing good cross-department working relations, our project has embodied many of the benefits and challenges of digital work in the humanities. By identifying our procedures, and by laying out our future hurdles, we hope we can advance knowledge about Whitman and about how scholars and archivists can collaborate effectively to advance research, improve access, and realize the potential of EAD.", "article_title": "Ordering Chaos: An Integrated Guide and Online Archive of Walt Whitman's Poetry Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": " Brett", "family": "Barney", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}, {"given": " Mary Ellen", "family": "Ducey", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}, {"given": " Andrew", "family": "Jewell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}, {"given": " Kenneth M.", "family": "Price", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}, {"given": " Brian Pytlik", "family": "Zillig", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}, {"given": " Katherine L.", "family": "Walter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraska–Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2005-03-24", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "20", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
