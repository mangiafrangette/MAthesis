Quantitative narrative analysis (QNA) is used to explore a cleaned subcorpus, the Gutenberg English Poetry Corpus (GEPC), which comprises over 100 poetic texts with around two million words from about 50 authors (e.g., Keats, Joyce, Wordsworth). Some exemplary QNA studies show author similarities based on latent semantic analysis, significant topics for each author or various text-analytic metrics for George Eliot’s poem “How Lisa Loved the King” and James Joyce’s “Chamber Music,” concerning, e.g., lexical diversity or sentiment analysis. The GEPC is particularly suited for research in Digital Humanities, Computational Stylistics, or Neurocognitive Poetics, e.g., as training and test corpus for stimulus development and control in empirical studies.", "article_title": "The Gutenberg English Poetry Corpus: Exemplary Quantitative Narrative Analyses", "authors": [{"given": "Arthur M.", "family": "Jacobs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Experimental and Neurocognitive Psychology, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany", "normalized_name": "Freie Universität Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/046ak2485", "GRID": "grid.14095.39"}}]}], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "date": "2018", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Frontiers in Digital Humanities", "volume": "5", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2297-2668", "type": "electronic"}]}
