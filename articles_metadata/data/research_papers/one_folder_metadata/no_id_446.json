Among the first are the different kinds of language usage among editors of print and electronic editions; these – particularly that of ›reader‹ and ›user‹ – point up different expectations and different goals in the two mediums. Questions thus arise as to the purpose in editing an electronic edition and their impact on the way the electronic editor thinks about the text. The implications of the word ›user‹, are explored especially in relation to annotation. Annotation in turn calls for attention to how the text is marked-up in TEI. Throughout the change from the one medium to the other, the editor has to reassess his relation to what he thought were the critical priorities of the text, as well as to his user. The final part of the paper looks at issues of navigation and the demands to think critically about the dynamics of the edition. That takes the editor back to the fundamental question about the purpose of an electronic edition", "article_title": "Bridging the Gap ", "authors": [{"given": "Tim", "family": "McLoughlin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Moore Institute, National University of Ireland", "normalized_name": "National University of Ireland", "country": "Ireland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00shsf120", "GRID": "grid.9344.a"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": "10", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
