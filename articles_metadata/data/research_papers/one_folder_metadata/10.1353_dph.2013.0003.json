Awareness of the characteristic features of medieval textuality, exemplified through select late medieval texts, can help in developing increasingly flexible editorial models, which are more consistent with medieval reading practices than current editions. Editions, transformed from single textual occurrences into fluid, communal, and unfolding processes, can uncover a complex notion of medieval hypertextuality by linking texts, images, and tunes. They can then even trace the reception of a given text. As readers are empowered to zoom in and out specific textual components, of manuscript witnesses, of families and printed editions, digital editions can present individual witnesses alongside editorial apparatuses and thus bridge the gap between the Old and the New Philology.", "article_title": "Old Light on New Media: Medieval Practices in the Digital Age", "authors": [{"given": "Farkas Gábor", "family": "Kiss", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Leopold-Franzens-Universität, Innsbruck", "normalized_name": "Universität Innsbruck", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/054pv6659", "GRID": "grid.5771.4"}}]}, {"given": "Eyal", "family": "Poleg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Edinburgh", "normalized_name": "University of Edinburgh", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01nrxwf90", "GRID": "grid.4305.2"}}]}, {"given": "Lucie", "family": "Doležalová", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Univerzita Karlova, Praha", "normalized_name": "Charles University", "country": "Czechia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/024d6js02", "GRID": "grid.4491.8"}}]}, {"given": "Rafal", "family": "Wójcik", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Uniwersytet im.
