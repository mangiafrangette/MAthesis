This article focuses mainly on what ›using‹ a scholarly edition means and problematizes what impact this has on the shift from hard-copy to electronic editing. It is argued that there is not so much a gap between print and electronic medium but much more a transition in a thinking process: from the output orientation of the classical style of editing towards a data- and user-driven new approach.
