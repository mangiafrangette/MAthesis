It brings together two archeologists and a mathematician in the study of a large inventory of 57,735 Italian and Greek imports discovered from England to Serbia. This large amount of new and unpublished data is analyzed through the joint use of network analysis tools and formal statistical methods. The analysis focuses on detecting patterns in the association of imported artifacts that are often found on the same sites. The objectives are to highlight groups of imports that may have circulated together and to emphasize regional selections by local populations. At this stage of the study, two main systems of imports have been highlighted used, respectively, in West and Central Europe. Interesting leads that will need further investigation include the imports status and the role they played in Celtic societies, as acculturated objects or more as objects for acculturation.", "article_title": "Co-presence Analysis and Economic Patterns: Mediterranean Imports in the Celtic World", "authors": [{"given": "Aurélia", "family": "Feugnet", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UMR 7041 ArScAn ’Archéologies Environnementales’, University Paris 1, France", "normalized_name": "Paris 13 University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0199hds37", "GRID": "grid.11318.3a"}}]}, {"given": "Fabrice", "family": "Rossi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UMR 8546 AOROC ’Celtes et Etrusques’, University Paris 1, France", "normalized_name": "Paris 13 University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0199hds37", "GRID": "grid.11318.3a"}}]}, {"given": "Clara", "family": "Filet", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "EA 4543 ’SAMM’, University Paris 1, France", "normalized_name": "Paris 13 University", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0199hds37", "GRID": "grid.11318.3a"}}]}], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "date": "2017-02-01", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Frontiers in Digital Humanities", "volume": "4", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2297-2668", "type": "electronic"}]}
