Intellectual and operational choices permeated the design and implementation of the digital architecture to provide internet access to the vast information structures inherent in legacy records for the cultural heritage of Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. We explore how an expansive but focused repository can enable opportunities for research and foster communities of co-creation. We also use the CRA as a case study to outline some of the pitfalls of conventional academic metrics for scholarly impact and provide some alternative means to assess the value of digital heritage resources.", "article_title": "Innovation through Large-Scale Integration of Legacy Records", "authors": [{"given": "Carrie", "family": "Heitman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE", "normalized_name": "University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/043mer456", "GRID": "grid.24434.35"}}]}, {"given": "Worthy", "family": "Martin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": "Stephen", "family": "Plog", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2017-07-31", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "10", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
