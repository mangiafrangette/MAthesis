Policy governs how a digital library is instantiated and run. It is therefore a meta-domain which is situated both outside the digital library and any technologies used to deliver it, and within the digital library itself. Policy is also a key aspect of digital library and digital repository interoperability in a common and integrated information space. Policy interoperability - that is the exchange and reuse of policies - is a step beyond policy standardisation. Furthermore, effective and efficient policy frameworks are also one of the Digital Curation Center (DCC), DigitalPreservationEurope (DPE), nestor and Center for Research Libraries (CRL) core criteria for digital repositories. In this article, we share our research on policy interoperability levels and the experimental survey on policy interoperability conducted with real-life digital libraries, as a contribution towards the definition of a Policy Interoperability Framework.", "article_title": "Towards a Holistic Approach to Policy Interoperability in Digital Libraries and Digital Repositories", "authors": [{"given": "Perla", "family": "Innocenti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "HATII, University of Glasgow", "normalized_name": "University of Glasgow", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00vtgdb53", "GRID": "grid.8756.c"}}]}, {"given": "MacKenzie", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "MIT Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Kevin", "family": "Ashley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Curation Centre", "normalized_name": "Digital Curation Centre", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k9d6864", "GRID": "grid.499933.d"}}]}, {"given": "Seamus", "family": "Ross", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Toronto", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}, {"given": "Antonella", "family": "De Robbio", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Padua", "normalized_name": "University of Padua", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00240q980", "GRID": "grid.5608.b"}}]}, {"given": "Hans", "family": "Pfeiffenberger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Alfred Wagner Institute", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "John", "family": "Faundeen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "US Geological Survey", "normalized_name": "United States Geological Survey", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/035a68863", "GRID": "grid.2865.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
