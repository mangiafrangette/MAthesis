We describe an experiment involving three artificial benchmark data sets to which a number of computer-assisted stemmatology methods were applied. Contrary to earlier similar experiments, we propose and use a numerical criterion to evaluate all the solutions. Moreover, our primary data set is significantly larger than used before. The results suggest the superiority of two computer-assisted methods amongst those tested: the maximum parsimony method implemented in the PAUP* software package and a related compression-based method we have proposed in earlier work.", "article_title": "Evaluating methods for computer-assisted stemmatology using artificial benchmark data sets", "authors": [{"given": " Teemu", "family": "Roos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and the National Library of Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland", "normalized_name": "University of Helsinki", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/040af2s02", "GRID": "grid.7737.4"}}]}, {"given": " Tuomas", "family": "Heikkil√§", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of History, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland", "normalized_name": "University of Helsinki", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/040af2s02", "GRID": "grid.7737.4"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
