Its debt to Boethius, the Bible, and patristic writings has been analyzed. There may be another source less acknowledged: the Commedia of Dante Alighieri. Is it possible that Chartier was influenced by Dante's work? This essay traces the evidence and possibilities for such a textual encounter. Establishing the influence of Dante on Chartier allows further recognition of the paths by which humanist ideas from Italy entered France during the transitional fifteenth century.", "article_title": "Alain Chartier's Livre de l'Espérance: A Remodeling of Dante's Commedia?", "authors": [{"given": "Joan E.", "family": "McRae", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Middle Tennessee State University", "normalized_name": "Middle Tennessee State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02n1hzn07", "GRID": "grid.260001.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
