The purpose of the experiment was primarily to find out what kind of digital artefact could be generated from an early modern book. Secondarily, we wanted to contemplate potential use for such an artefact, which subsequently was clearly established as teaching bibliography, or book or print culture. The resulting paper started life as a wiki contributed to by three of the members of the group who conducted the experiment. It was then carried further by the present author. It continues to evolve, and two members of the group plan to publish a longer version of this essay in the near future.", "article_title": "Dis-Covering the Early Modern Book: An Experiment in Humanities Computing", "authors": [{"given": "Richard", "family": "Cunningham", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Acadia University", "normalized_name": "Acadia University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00839we02", "GRID": "grid.411959.1"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": ["Book history, bibliography, print culture, digitization, education, digital artefact, born digital, Gutenberg, electronic text, Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory, bibliosection, SDH/SEMI, virtual lightbox"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
