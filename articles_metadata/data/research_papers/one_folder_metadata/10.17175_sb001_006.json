The goal of heureCLÉA is to develop a ›digital heuristic‹ that supports the narratological analysis of literary texts by (1) performing automatically annotation tasks up to a certain level of complexity that previously could only be carried out manually, and by (2) identifying statistically salient text phenomena for the subsequent detailed analysis by the human user.In this project, it was essential to devote special attention to the specific disciplinary approaches. In this paper, we illustrate the ways in which the tensions between (non-deterministic) hermeneutics in the humanities and (deterministic) computer science can be productively employed and thus have an effect beyond the concrete research question.", "article_title": "Informatik und Hermeneutik.
