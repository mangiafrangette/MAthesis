Findings from this mixed-methods study show that data reusers utilizing qualitative video data did not use repository-based tools. Rather, they valued common, widely available tools that were collaborative and easy to use.   ", "article_title": "Tool Selection Among Qualitative Data Reusers", "authors": [{"given": "Rebecca D.", "family": "Frank", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "normalized_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hcx6992", "GRID": "grid.7468.d"}}]}, {"given": "Kara", "family": "Suzuka", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa", "normalized_name": "University of Hawaii at Manoa", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01wspgy28", "GRID": "grid.410445.0"}}]}, {"given": "Eric", "family": "Johnson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Michigan", "normalized_name": "University of Michigan–Ann Arbor", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00jmfr291", "GRID": "grid.214458.e"}}]}, {"given": "Elizabeth", "family": "Yakel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Michigan", "normalized_name": "University of Michigan–Ann Arbor", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00jmfr291", "GRID": "grid.214458.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2020", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
