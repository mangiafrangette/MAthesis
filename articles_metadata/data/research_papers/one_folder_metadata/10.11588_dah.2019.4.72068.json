The goal of the workshop was to probe the field and to build a constructive interdisciplinary dialogue between two research areas: Data Science and Art History. The workshop’s chairs and the authors of this paper share the conviction that Data Science can enrich art studies while analysis of visual data can have a positive impact on Data Science. Thus, the research initiative tried to critically reflect on the interdisciplinary collaboration between diverse research communities and its epistemological and ontological effects.", "article_title": "Method in Interdisciplinary Research", "authors": [{"given": "Ewa", "family": "Machotka", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stockholm University", "normalized_name": "Stockholm University", "country": "Sweden", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05f0yaq80", "GRID": "grid.10548.38"}}]}, {"given": "Panagiotis", "family": "Papapetrou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Stockholm University", "normalized_name": "Stockholm University", "country": "Sweden", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05f0yaq80", "GRID": "grid.10548.38"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2020-03-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal for Digital Art History", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2363-5401", "type": "electronic"}, {"value": "2363-5398", "type": "print"}]}
