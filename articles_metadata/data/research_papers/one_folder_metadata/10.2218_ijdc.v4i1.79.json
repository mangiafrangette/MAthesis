Trustworthy processes, re-definition of traditional roles, and the implementation of technologies to support authenticity are all required to meet the needs of digital scholarship.  Implementation and policy issues are discussed with specific attention to transformations required of the archival institution and the professional archivist.", "article_title": "An Institutional Framework for Creating Authentic Digital Objects", "authors": [{"given": "Ronald", "family": "Jantz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Rutgers University Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009-06-29", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
