This article proposes a novel approach for co-referent record identification which is suitable for use across multiple separate collections. The proposed approach is intended to be suitable for use despite highly imprecise/uncertain attribute values in the records. It is hoped that this can be achieved through a combination of aspects from the fields of probabillistic record linkage, document classification, and fuzzy clustering.", "article_title": "Improving record matching in imprecise and uncertain datasets", "authors": [{"given": " David", "family": "Croft", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "De Montfort University, UK", "normalized_name": "De Montfort University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0312pnr83", "GRID": "grid.48815.30"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "27", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
