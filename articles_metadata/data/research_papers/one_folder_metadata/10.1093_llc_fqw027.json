Previous statistical research finds that translations vary most where the source items are most semantically significant or express most ‘attitude’ (affect, evaluation, ideology). Understanding how and why translations vary is important for translator training and translation quality assessment, for cultural research, and for machine translation development. Our experimental project began with the intuition that quantitative variation in a corpus of historical retranslations might be used to project quasi-qualitative annotations onto the translated text. We present a web-based system which enables users to create parallel, segment-aligned multi-version corpora, and provides visual interfaces for exploring multiple translations, with their variation projected onto a base text. The system can support any corpus of variant versions. We report experiments using our tools (and stylometric analysis) to investigate a corpus of forty German versions of a work by Shakespeare. Initial findings lead to more questions than answers.", "article_title": "Multi-Retranslation Corpora: Visibility, Variation, Value, and Virtue", "authors": [{"given": " Tom", "family": "Cheesman", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Languages, Swansea University, UK", "normalized_name": "Swansea University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/053fq8t95", "GRID": "grid.4827.9"}}]}, {"given": " Kevin", "family": "Flanagan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Languages, Swansea University, UK and SDL Research, Bristol, UK", "normalized_name": "Swansea University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/053fq8t95", "GRID": "grid.4827.9"}}]}, {"given": " Stephan", "family": "Thiel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bauhaus University Weimar, Germany and Studio Nand, Berlin", "normalized_name": "Bauhaus University, Weimar", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/033bb5z47", "GRID": "grid.41315.32"}}]}, {"given": " Jan", "family": "Rybicki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of English Studies, Jagiellonian University, Poland", "normalized_name": "Jagiellonian University", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03bqmcz70", "GRID": "grid.5522.0"}}]}, {"given": " Robert S.", "family": "Laramee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, Swansea University, UK", "normalized_name": "Swansea University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/053fq8t95", "GRID": "grid.4827.9"}}]}, {"given": " Jonathan", "family": "Hope", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, Strathclyde University, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Strathclyde", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00n3w3b69", "GRID": "grid.11984.35"}}]}, {"given": " Avraham", "family": "Roos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Amsterdam School of Culture and History, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands", "normalized_name": "University of Amsterdam", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04dkp9463", "GRID": "grid.7177.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
