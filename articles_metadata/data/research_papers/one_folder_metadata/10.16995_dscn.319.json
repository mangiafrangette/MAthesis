This paper outlines Michael Iantorno’s and Melissa Mony’s experiences with quantitative game analysis by summarizing the first year of development of the prototype ludomusicological database GameSound. To further the discussion, this article also summarizes and analyzes the work of fellow digital humanities scholar Jason Bradshaw, who applied intriguing types of tool-based analysis to BioShock Infinite. To conclude, the paper hypothesizes where this type of research could lead in the future: both for GameSound and for other projects using similar methods and methodologies.", "article_title": "GameSound, Quantitative Games Analysis, and the Digital Humanities", "authors": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5456-1001", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Michael", "family": "Iantorno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Concordia University", "normalized_name": "Concordia University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01qxhf360", "GRID": "grid.448967.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2020", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
