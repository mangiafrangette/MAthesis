The transcribed data underwent several interesting metamorphoses throughout the process; the transformation reflects the history of digital philology itself. Out review of the project is geared both towards philological aspects, like the changed status of transcripts within edition projects, and the different transcription systems; as well as technical aspects, like changes in hardware, software and publication formats.", "article_title": "Zur Immortalit채t elektronischer Korpora am Beispiel der Musil-Edition", "authors": [{"given": "Walter", "family": "Fanta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Robert-Musil-Institut f체r Literaturforschung, Universit채t Klagenfurt", "normalized_name": "University of Klagenfurt", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05q9m0937", "GRID": "grid.7520.0"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch f체r Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
