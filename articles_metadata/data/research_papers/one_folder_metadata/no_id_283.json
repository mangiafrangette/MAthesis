{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Digital Humanities (DH) methods incorporated into traditional (non-DH) humanities classrooms present a fruitful opportunity to help undergraduate students learn digital literacy skills as well as new ways of studying the humanities. In light of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence with it through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community when they themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist, from reluctance to change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore, this article offers a selection of accessible DH methods that can be used to positively shape humanities pedagogy.
