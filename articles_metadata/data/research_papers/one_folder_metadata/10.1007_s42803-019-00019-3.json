As such, they prove unattainable for less established scholars like early careers and PhD students, or indeed anyone without access to significant funding. One solution could be to create tools and platforms able to provide a publishing framework for digital scholarly editions that requires neither a high-tech skillset nor big investment.

I argued that both types of editions are necessary for a healthy scholarly environment.", "article_title": "What future for digital scholarly editions?
