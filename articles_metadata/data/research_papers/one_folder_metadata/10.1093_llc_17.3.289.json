The Pascal Database includes all the text from the Œuvres complèetes de Blaise Pascal in four volumes. The online database was released experimentally in October 2000. It is possible to display material, perform a vocabulary search, and make frequency lists of material in the database via the Internet. The content display can access each volume, plus manuscript data, edition, references, annotations of J. Mesnard, and other documents, which is a great advantage when studying the material. The vocabulary search can perform Boolean searches with ‘And’, ‘Or’, and ‘Not’, and can also use the wild card ‘★’. Frequency lists can be made using alphabetical or frequency order, and it is even possible to create a list based on the alphabetical order of the reversed words. Finally, we comment on the personal pronouns in Pascal's letters and discuss the uses of the word figure in the second volume of Pascal's work.", "article_title": "The Pascal Digital Archive", "authors": [{"given": "S.", "family": "Shiraishi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "17", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
