Since we can neither ignore nor eliminate uncertainty, we need to model it, and so we need computational models of uncertainty. Such models already exist and are being used in practical applications. There is ongoing fundamental research on uncertainty and its representation in mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. Some of these approaches may be suitable for modeling uncertainty in the humanities—but we are still lacking the »bridge« that could relate the uncertainty encountered in the humanities to such formal modeling frameworks. We argue that DH needs to go beyond project-specific models of uncertainty and consider uncertainty more generally; in particular, we must closely examine various types of uncertainty in the humanities and seek to develop more general frameworks for handling it.", "article_title": "Accepting and Modeling Uncertainty", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Piotrowski", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université de Lausanne, Section des sciences du langage et de l’information", "normalized_name": "University of Lausanne", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/019whta54", "GRID": "grid.9851.5"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Sonderband 4", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1366", "type": "electronic"}]}
