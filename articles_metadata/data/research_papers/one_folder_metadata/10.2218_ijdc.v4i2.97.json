The XAM API focuses on the creation and management of reference information (otherwise known as fixed content). Storage vendors supporting the XAM API will provide new benefits to applications that are creating and managing large amounts of fixed content. The benefits described by this paper merit consideration and research by developers creating applications for Digital Curators.", "article_title": "The eXtensible Access Method (XAM) Standard", "authors": [{"given": "Steve", "family": "Todd", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "EMC Corporation,Hopkinton, Massachusetts, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "4", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
