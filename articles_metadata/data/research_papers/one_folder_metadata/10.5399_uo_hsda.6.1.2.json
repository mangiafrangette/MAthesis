In the interview, Levy addresses the creation o the WWW by Tim Berners Lee as a form of collective intelligence. He then discusses Berners Lee's proposal for a reform of the WWW to avoid its confiscation by the big platforms, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Then, he introduces his most recent project the IELM as a tool for semantic metadata and a code between the natural languages and the algorithms, and all the apparatus of computations.", "article_title": "Collective Intelligence, the Future of Internet and the IEML: Interview to Pierre Lévy by Art Farley and Massimo Lollini", "authors": [{"given": "Pierre", "family": "Lévy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Ottawa", "normalized_name": "University of Ottawa", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03c4mmv16", "GRID": "grid.28046.38"}}]}, {"given": "Art", "family": "Farley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Oregon", "normalized_name": "University of Oregon", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0293rh119", "GRID": "grid.170202.6"}}]}, {"given": "Massimo", "family": "Lollini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Oregon", "normalized_name": "University of Oregon", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0293rh119", "GRID": "grid.170202.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Semantic Metadata, Humanist Computing, and Digital Humanities", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
