It reviews the characteristics and applicability of different stylometric methods and demonstrates their use by case studies based on Kelemen Mikes’ (1690-1761) works. It examines the relationships between Mikes’ own works and his translations as well as the thematic separation of his works. The case studies highlight that the effectiveness of the stylometric analyses of Mikes’ writings can be improved by applying the digital Mikes’ dictionary.", "article_title": "The Potentials of Stylometry Analysis of Hungarian Historical Text Corpora", "authors": [{"given": "Margit", "family": "Kiss", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digitális Bölcsészet", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2630-9696", "type": "print"}]}
