The basic approach is to privilege what happens in actual practice, to observe the commonalities and generalize from them to a picture of the interrelations between the field and the non-technical disciplines of the humanities. These generalizations also lead to discovery of intellectual kinships with several traditional fields of study: philosophy and history (including the history and philosophy of science), ethnography, sociology, literary criticism and so on. The essay argues that in these kinships are to be found the basic questions with which we may build a computing that is of as well as in the humanities.", "article_title": "NEW SPLASHINGS IN THE OLD POND: THE COHESIBILITY OF HUMANITIES COMPUTING", "authors": [{"given": "Willard", "family": "McCarty", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2002", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch f√ºr Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
