It lays out the material characteristics of the codex, and sets them in contrast with a matrix of relevant features from other witnesses of March’s poetry. As a result, this study uncovers several of the stages in the compilatory process of the manuscript and argues for it having been originally owned by Ferrando de Cardona, Admiral of Naples and Duke of Somma (Naples, 1521-Sant Cugat del Vallès, 1571).", "article_title": "Readers and Compilators of Ausiàs March’s Poetry in Barcelona (BNE, MS 2985)", "authors": [{"given": "Albert", "family": "Lloret", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Massachusetts, Amherst", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
