In this paper, we use digital tools to search for expressions of nationalism in Dutch newspaper discourse in the late nineteenth century by text mining in large newspaper repositories. The absence of emotional nationalist rhetoric in Dutch national newspapers suggests that nationalism in the late nineteenth century was much more subtle than the literature based on elite discourse tells us.
