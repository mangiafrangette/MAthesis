James (who has aged healthily). We avoid the limitations and deficiencies of Garrard et al.'s [(2005), The effects of very early Alzheimer's disease on the characteristics of writing by a renowned author. Brain, 128 (2): 250–60] earlier study of Iris Murdoch. Our results support the hypothesis that signs of dementia can be found in diachronic analyses of patients’ writings, and in addition lead to new understanding of the work of the individual authors whom we studied. In particular, we show that it is probable that Agatha Christie indeed suffered from the onset of Alzheimer's while writing her last novels, and that Iris Murdoch exhibited a ‘trough’ of relatively impoverished vocabulary and syntax in her writing in her late 40s and 50s that presaged her later dementia.", "article_title": "Longitudinal detection of dementia through lexical and syntactic changes in writing: a case study of three British novelists", "authors": [{"given": "Xuan", "family": "Le", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3G4", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}, {"given": "Ian", "family": "Lancashire", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5R 2M8", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}, {"given": "Graeme", "family": "Hirst", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3G4", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}, {"given": "Regina", "family": "Jokel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Speech–Language Pathology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1V7", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}, {"original_name": "Kunin-Lunenfeld Applied Research Unit, Baycrest Hospital, 3560 Bathurst Street, North York, Ontario, Canada M6A 2E1", "normalized_name": "Baycrest Hospital", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03gp5b411", "GRID": "grid.423198.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "26", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
