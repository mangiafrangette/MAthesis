This project is intended as a feasibility study examining the use of a digital large-format gigapixel camera to capture high-resolution images in a cultural heritage setting. In particular, we report on the current challenges faced by the Dunhuang Academy in their imaging efforts and how the use of a digital large-format camera can improve the quality of the imaging process while reducing time and effort. We also describe lessons learned from this field study as well as remaining challenges inherent to such projects.", "article_title": "Imaging buddhist art with a digital large-format camera", "authors": [{"given": "Zheng", "family": "Lu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Microsoft Research Asia, Singapore", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Wei", "family": "Luo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Microsoft Research Asia, Shatin, Hong Kong", "normalized_name": "Microsoft Research Asia (China)", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0300m5276", "GRID": "grid.466946.f"}}]}, {"given": "Zhijun", "family": "Sun", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Dunhuang Academy, China", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Moshe", "family": "Ben-Ezra", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China", "normalized_name": "Microsoft Research Asia (China)", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0300m5276", "GRID": "grid.466946.f"}}]}, {"given": "Michael S.", "family": "Brown", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National University of Singapore, Singapore", "normalized_name": "National University of Singapore", "country": "Singapore", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tgyzw49", "GRID": "grid.4280.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2012-10-26", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "5", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
