In constrained environments, traditional acquisition techniques may fail or be too invasive. We present an optical device including a camera and a wedge waveguide that is optimized for imaging within confined spaces in archeology. The major idea is to redirect light by total internal reflection to circumvent the lack of room, and to compute the final image from the raw data. We tested various applications on site during an archaeological mission in Medamoud (Egypt). Our device was able to successfully record images of the underground from slim trenches of about 15cm wide, including underwater trenches, and between rocks composing a wall temple. Experts agreed that the acquired images were good enough to get useful information that cannot be obtained as easily with traditional techniques.", "article_title": "Wedge Cameras for Minimally Invasive Archaeology", "authors": [{"given": "Thomas", "family": "Crespel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest/LP2N/Université de Bordeaux, Talence, France", "normalized_name": "University of Bordeaux", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057qpr032", "GRID": "grid.412041.2"}}]}, {"given": "Adrian", "family": "Travis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}]}, {"given": "Patrick", "family": "Reuter", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest/Université de Bordeaux/LaBRI, Talence, France", "normalized_name": "University of Bordeaux", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057qpr032", "GRID": "grid.412041.2"}}]}, {"given": "Xavier", "family": "Granier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institut d’Optique Graduate School/LP2N/Archéovision, Talence, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2019-05-08", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "12", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
