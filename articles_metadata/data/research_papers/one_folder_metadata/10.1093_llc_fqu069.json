This tendency cannot be found in the novels of Jane Austen, suggesting this drop is not intrinsic to the romance genre itself, and is unlikely to have any true narrative purpose. A study of Charles Dickens shows that vocabulary decay extends beyond the romance genre. Closer examination reveals vocabulary decay is a result of progressive amounts of linguistic chunking—due to author fatigue or a desire to produce a more readable narrative.", "article_title": "Vocabulary decay in category romance", "authors": [{"given": " Jack", "family": "Elliott", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Literary and Linquistic Computing, University of Newcastle, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "31", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
