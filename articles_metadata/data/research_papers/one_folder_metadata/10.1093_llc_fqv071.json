In the domain of story generation and interactive digital storytelling, this concept is particularly powerful in creating meaningful story variations from a single core model. Nevertheless, dramatic situations and the related notion of deep narrative structures have been overlooked in the domain of computational models of narrative. This article presents a computational model of dramatic situations. Designed with creative authors in mind, the model consists of a small set of building blocks that, when assembled with specific relations, create narrative structures. Some structures that are described are of particular interest from a dramatic point of view, for they embed a fundamental paradox. These structures are generalized and formalized to allow an exhaustive search and to establish an initial list of dramatic situations that share this property.", "article_title": "Modeling and Representing Dramatic Situations as Paradoxical Structures", "authors": [{"given": " Nicolas", "family": "Szilas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TECFA, FPSE, University of Geneva, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Geneva", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01swzsf04", "GRID": "grid.8591.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
