{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " For digital humanists planning to build tools for cyberinfrastructure several variables ought to be defined for each project. Pay close attention to the balance of traditional methods and new ways of conducting research. When gathering resources to do the job, seek contributions of different domain experts. Also, careful consideration of a toolâ€™s intended scope will help refine the required resources needed to complete a project. This case study illustrates how one project, the Social Networks and Archival Context Project (SNAC), has defined these variables. The process of building a new tool also benefits from an awareness of older infrastructure that has come before it. SNAC illustrates this awareness in the way it has taken advantage of previously existing infrastructure, both cyber and not, by extending its purpose and building new features on top of it.
