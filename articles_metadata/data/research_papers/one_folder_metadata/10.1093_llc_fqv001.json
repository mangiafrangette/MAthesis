The methodology presented is the product of detailed theoretical study of the semantic nature of verbs in Basque and of their similarities and differences with verbs in other languages. As part of the proposed methodology, we are creating a Basque lexicon on the PropBank-VerbNet model that we have named the Basque Verb Index (BVI). Our work thus dovetails with the general trend toward building lexicons from tagged corpora that is clear in work conducted for other languages. EPEC-RolSem and BVI are two important resources for the computational semantic processing of Basque; as far as the authors are aware, they are also the first resources of their kind developed for Basque. In addition, each entry in BVI is linked to the corresponding verb-entry in well-known resources like PropBank, VerbNet, WordNet, FrameNet, and Levin’s classification. We have also implemented several automatic processes to aid in creating and annotating the BVI, including processes designed to facilitate the task of manual annotation.", "article_title": "A methodology for the semiautomatic annotation of EPEC-RolSem, a Basque corpus labeled at predicate level following the PropBank-VerbNet model", "authors": [{"given": " Ainara", "family": "Estarrona", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "IXA NLP Group, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Spain", "normalized_name": "University of the Basque Country", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/000xsnr85", "GRID": "grid.11480.3c"}}]}, {"given": " Izaskun", "family": "Aldezabal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "IXA NLP Group, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Spain", "normalized_name": "University of the Basque Country", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/000xsnr85", "GRID": "grid.11480.3c"}}]}, {"given": " Arantza", "family": "Díaz de Ilarraza", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "IXA NLP Group, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Spain", "normalized_name": "University of the Basque Country", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/000xsnr85", "GRID": "grid.11480.3c"}}]}, {"given": " María Jesús", "family": "Aranzabe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "IXA NLP Group, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Spain", "normalized_name": "University of the Basque Country", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/000xsnr85", "GRID": "grid.11480.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2015-06-18", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "31", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
