Despite being the so-called digital natives, many of my museum studies students have no desire to engage with new technology. This short paper is a snapshot of my attempt to teach digital curation and online exhibit development within the framework of my material culture seminar. It analyses 3 years of student exhibits developed using Omeka and points to new directions the project will go over the next several years. I began the research project by asking the following questions of my students: What does material culture look like on the web? How do you curate it? How does the public interact with virtual objects? What is the relationship between virtual and physical museum artifacts? However, after seeing the students struggle with basic web development, I expanded my own research questions to include: What skills do emerging professionals need and how can we integrate technical training into an academic program?", "article_title": "Omeka in the classroom: The challenges of teaching material culture in a digital world", "authors": [{"given": " Allison C.", "family": "Marsh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of South Carolina", "normalized_name": "University of South Carolina", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02b6qw903", "GRID": "grid.254567.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
