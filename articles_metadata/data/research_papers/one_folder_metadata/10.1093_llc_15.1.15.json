The Perseus architecture includes tools that fit the needs of humanists: linguistic analysis for heavily inflected languages, linking and alignment with canonical citation schemes, and terminological, spatial, and visual databases for document contextualization. These tools provide both the scalability to connect disparate entities in the digital library and a groundwork for performance of the synthetic scholarship of the humanities.", "article_title": "The Perseus Project: a digital library for the humanities", "authors": [{"given": "D.", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "J.", "family": "Rydberg-Cox", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "G.", "family": "Crane", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
