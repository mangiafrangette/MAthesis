This tool carries out the function of analyzing morphologically and syntactically sentences, phrases, and words in order to correct syntactic, grammatical, and stylistic errors (Iordanidou, 1999, 2004). Our premise in order to deal with all these issues is the settings of Grammar (adaptation of Little Modern Grammar of Manolis Triantafyllidis), which is the formal grammatical codification of Modern Greek, since 1976 (Triantafyllidis, 1991). This paper also presents the formalism used (the Mnemosyne), a formalism that handles with the particularities of the Greek language that hinder the computational processing. This formalism has already been used to identify multi-word terms and to phrase grammars, aiming to automatically extract information. We tested the Greek grammar checker by giving texts that were to be evaluated both to the grammar checker and to a person. In the majority of cases, the human corrector accuracy is almost equal to the grammar checker one. As far as mistakes that have to do with the coherence of the text or with meaning are concerned, the human corrector was the only accurate corrector, not the grammar checker one (Gakis, 2015).", "article_title": "Design and construction of the Greek grammar checker", "authors": [{"given": " Panagiotis", "family": "Gakis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Primary Education, University of Patras, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Patras", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017wvtq80", "GRID": "grid.11047.33"}}]}, {"given": " Christos", "family": "Panagiotakopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Primary Education, University of Patras, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Patras", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017wvtq80", "GRID": "grid.11047.33"}}]}, {"given": " Kyriakos", "family": "Sgarbas", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Greece", "normalized_name": "University of Patras", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017wvtq80", "GRID": "grid.11047.33"}}]}, {"given": " Christos", "family": "Tsalidis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Neurolingo Language Technology Applications, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Vassilios", "family": "Verykios", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Science and Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece", "normalized_name": "Hellenic Open University", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02kq26x23", "GRID": "grid.55939.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
