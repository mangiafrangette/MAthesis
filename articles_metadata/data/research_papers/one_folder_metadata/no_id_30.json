This paper describes a design for a scholastic course taught entirely on the world wide web that has at its core customized online discussion forums. The design has been implemented in two Carleton University Philosophy courses, Computer Ethics and Information Ethics, open to qualified students across North America. Evaluations by students and of students indicate that the courses have not only met, but exceeded the learning goals of a corresponding classroom course. The success of the model implies that many courses hitherto assumed to require classrooms can be taught online as distance education courses.", "article_title": "Teaching Scholastic Courses Requiring Discussion On Line", "authors": [{"given": "Diane E.", "family": "Dubrule", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Philosophy Department, Carleton University", "normalized_name": "Carleton University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02qtvee93", "GRID": "grid.34428.39"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2003", "keywords": ["Discussion boards, philosophy, pedagogy, technology, information ethics, computer ethics"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
