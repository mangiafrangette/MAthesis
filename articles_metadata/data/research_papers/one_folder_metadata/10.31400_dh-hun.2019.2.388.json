The original nature and context of these records were different. In order to create effective services upon them we should know the strength and weakness or in other words the quality of these data. This paper proposes a method and an open source implementation to measure some structural features of these data, such as completeness, multilinguality, uniqueness, record patterns, to reveal quality issues.", "article_title": "Measuring completeness as metadata quality metric in Europeana", "authors": [{"given": "Péter", "family": "Király", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Marco", "family": "Büchler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digitális Bölcsészet", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2630-9696", "type": "electronic"}]}
