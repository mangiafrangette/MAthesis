Curiously, the justification provided for censoring the game echoes the ethical arguments advanced by scholars and designers of pervasive games who warn that non-player bystanders are at risk of confusing games with reality. This essay considers the case in relation to Jacques Rancière's ethics of recognition. I argue that pervasive gamers should stop disguising their activities to protect bystanders, and begin instead to recognize non-players as equally capable of negotiating the blurred boundaries of game and world. The emancipation of game spectatorship creates genuinely political encounters, and opens up new channels for scholarly experimentation and dissemination.", "article_title": "Don't make a scene: Game studies for an uncertain world", "authors": [{"given": "Brian", "family": "Greenspan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2015", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "0", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
