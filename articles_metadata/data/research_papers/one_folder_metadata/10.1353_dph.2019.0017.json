This essay argues that Magriço (Álvaro Gonçalves Coutinho), the protagonist of \"The Twelve of England,\" embodies a larger theme in the epic of national belatedness that is integral to the poem's engagement with the temporalities of empire and cultural inheritance. But the Lusiads's utility as a cultural artifact celebrating the rise of new forms of knowledge and power also provides the conceptual basis for its symbolic appropriation by Portugal's imperial rivals, Spain and England. The essay concludes by examining representations of Camões in twentieth-century Brazilian folhetos (\"leaflets\"), or literatura de cordel, to show how the Lusiads's anxieties about textual survival and generativeness provide a discursive frame for Camões's later textual incarnations.", "article_title": "Oceanic Epic: The Translations of the Lusiads in the Global Renaissance", "authors": [{"given": "Sara V.", "family": "Torres", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Virginia", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
