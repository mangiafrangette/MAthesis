This system uses model search to select decomposable probability models describing the dependencies among the feature variables. These types of models have been found to be advantageous in terms of efficiency and representational power. Performance on the SENSEVAL evaluation data is discussed.", "article_title": "Selecting Decomposable Models for Word-Sense Disambiguation: The \"Grling-Sdm\" System", "authors": [{"given": "Tom", "family": "O'Hara", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and Computing Research Laboratory, New Mexico State University", "normalized_name": "New Mexico State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hpz7z43", "GRID": "grid.24805.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Janyce", "family": "Wiebe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and Computing Research Laboratory, New Mexico State University", "normalized_name": "New Mexico State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hpz7z43", "GRID": "grid.24805.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Rebecca", "family": "Bruce", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Asheville", "normalized_name": "University of North Carolina at Asheville", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017c6at71", "GRID": "grid.266856.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
