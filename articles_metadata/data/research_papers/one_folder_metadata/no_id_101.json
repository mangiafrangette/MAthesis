{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " This article argues that Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, while it cannot be considered a text straightforwardly concerned with technology, offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the delocalized and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the network. Unlike today’s seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in Winesburg, Ohio functions as a kluge, an ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole . Anderson’s kluge augurs network technology and therefore suggests that the form loomed large in modernists’ mind. However, Winesburg, Ohio illustrates the network’s propensity to foster users’ inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection and thereby warns against the antagonistic quality of the network’s rhizomatic structure.
