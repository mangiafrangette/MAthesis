Our hypertext-program is available in the World Wide Web and basically provides substantial information on authors (both literary and critical) and literary terms (in example genres, literary history, styles, theory) mentioned in the textbook. In addition, short original texts represent the most important critical schools. A system of links gives every user the opportunity to find her or his own path through the jungle of literary facts, concepts and terms. My paper tries to trace mainly the discussions and decisions in our working team, mostly of graduate students, to discuss the didactic possibilities of the hypertext, and to summarize the responses of users both in Essen and worldwide to our work-in-progress.", "article_title": "EINLADUNG ZUR LITERATURWISSENSCHAFT[1].
