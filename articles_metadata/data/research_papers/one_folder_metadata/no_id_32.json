Next, I will describe the editorial principles I am using to guide creation of an incunabular electronic edition of one of the examples discussed in this paper, Richard Eden's The Arte of Navigation. The paper concludes with an invitation to follow a link to that electronic edition, with the caveat that it is a work in progress.", "article_title": "Coincidental Technologies: Moving Parts in Early Books and in Early Hypertext", "authors": [{"given": "Richard", "family": "Cunningham", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Acadia University", "normalized_name": "Acadia University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00839we02", "GRID": "grid.411959.1"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2009", "keywords": ["Incunabula, editing, publishing, image, hypertext "], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
