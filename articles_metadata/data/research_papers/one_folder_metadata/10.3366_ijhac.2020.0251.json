Despite the many successes of scientifically-oriented archaeology, we contend that our discipline cannot achieve its broader aims without the humanities. We illustrate our argument by delineating three research domains – Deep Time Perspectives, Spatial Histories, and Public Engagement – and reviewing recent studies in each that have successfully integrated scientific and humanistic approaches to spatial archaeology.
