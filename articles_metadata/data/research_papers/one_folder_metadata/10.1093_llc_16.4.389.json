Distinct from each other, they have polarized our language into high diction and low (‘diglossia’). Latinate words denote the intellectual world; Germanic words, the physical. Latinate words are indicators of status and education. Austen painted and delineated her characters by giving their speeches different densities of Latinate words. Higher densities of Latinate words sometimes indicate intelligence and moral seriousness, at other times, they expose a character's formality or hypocrisy. Lower densities indicate lesser intelligence or, in the case of sailors, humble birth. The characters whose densities are very close to the narrator are Austen's four great heroines, Elinor Dashwood, Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Woodhouse, and Anne Elliot.", "article_title": "The Density of Latinate Words in the Speeches of Jane Austen's Characters", "authors": [{"given": " Mary", "family": "DeForest", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Colorado at DenverUSA", "normalized_name": "University of Colorado Denver", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02hh7en24", "GRID": "grid.241116.1"}}]}, {"given": " Eric", "family": "Johnson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Dakota State UniversityUSA", "normalized_name": "Dakota State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/016yv6y68", "GRID": "grid.254833.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
