The infrastructure created by TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research), however, provides an opportunity to go further than the hypertext edition, by integrating into it the capabilities offered by textual analysis software. The aim will be to develop an interface that permits a user to go beyond the hard links provided by the editor in the basic hypertext structure to explore in a more fluid way the text of a given play, and to extend the exploration to related texts by Shakespeare and other relevant writers in the period.", "article_title": "'Is this a vision? is this a dream?': Finding New Dimensions in Shakespeare's Texts", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Best", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Victoria", "normalized_name": "University of Victoria", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04s5mat29", "GRID": "grid.143640.4"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005", "keywords": ["TAPoR, Shakespeare, hypertext edition, text analysis software, interface design"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
