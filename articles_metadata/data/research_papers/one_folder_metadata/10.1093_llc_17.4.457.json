We focus on discourse relations of a temporal and causal interest and the use of linguistic knowledge for the determination of these relations. This analysis is applied to a corpus of short newspaper articles reporting car accidents in Modern Greek and the discourse grammar is implemented using the Attribute Logic Engine.", "article_title": "An SDRT Approach to the Temporal Structure of Modern Greek Narrative Texts", "authors": [{"given": "E.", "family": "Galiotou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "17", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
