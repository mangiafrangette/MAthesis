The authorship of such texts is always likely to be difficult to demonstrate. In some cases, the identity of the author is a question of interest to literary scholars. Even when that is not so, students of attribution face a challenge. If we cannot distinguish between original and imitation in such cases, we must always concede that an imitator may have been at work. Shamela (1741) has always been regarded as a brilliant parody. When it is subjected to our standard common-words tests of authorship, it yields mixed results. A new procedure, in which special word-lists are established according to a predetermined set of rules, proves more effective. It needs, however, to be tried in other cases.", "article_title": "Who wrote Shamela?
