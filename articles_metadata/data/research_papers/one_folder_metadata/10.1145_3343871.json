A major part of the project has been the iterative, participatory design of a new RDF/S Knowledge Base to store data and metadata relating to the UK’s museums, and a Web Application for the project’s humanities scholars to browse, search, and visualise the data to investigate their research questions. This article presents the challenges we faced in developing the Knowledge Base and Web Application, our methodology and methods, the design and implementation of the system, and the design, outcomes, and implications of a user trial undertaken with a group of experts from the UK’s museums sector.", "article_title": "Creating a Knowledge Base to Research the History of UK Museums through Rapid Application Development", "authors": [{"given": "Alexandra", "family": "Poulovassilis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Nick", "family": "Larsson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Fiona", "family": "Candlin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Jamie", "family": "Larkin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": "Andrea", "family": "Ballatore", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London, United Kingdom", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "12", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
