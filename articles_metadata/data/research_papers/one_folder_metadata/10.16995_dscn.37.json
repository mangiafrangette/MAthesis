Although the first stage of digital scholarship (providing digital content) seems to be a well mastered skill for Siberian researchers, the second stage of working with digital data and new research questions in the humanities does not seem to be within their comfort zone. We conclude that random digital humanities initiatives do not guarantee either demand for digital humanities or knowledge and understanding of new research questions inspired by new methodologies. Further studies might be needed to understand if we require lobbying for digital humanities and, if so, what kind of promotion, dissemination and training are needed or would be most effective.", "article_title": "Digital Humanities at Siberian Federal University", "authors": [{"given": "Inna", "family": "Kizhner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Siberian Federal University", "normalized_name": "Siberian Federal University", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fw97k56", "GRID": "grid.412592.9"}}]}, {"given": "Igor", "family": "Kim", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Siberian Federal University", "normalized_name": "Siberian Federal University", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fw97k56", "GRID": "grid.412592.9"}}]}, {"given": "Maxim", "family": "Rumyantsev", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Siberian Federal University", "normalized_name": "Siberian Federal University", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fw97k56", "GRID": "grid.412592.9"}}]}, {"given": "Marina", "family": "Lapteva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Siberian Federal University", "normalized_name": "Siberian Federal University", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fw97k56", "GRID": "grid.412592.9"}}]}, {"given": "Ruslan", "family": "Baryshev", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Siberian Federal University", "normalized_name": "Siberian Federal University", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fw97k56", "GRID": "grid.412592.9"}}]}, {"given": "Nikita", "family": "Pikov", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Siberian Federal University", "normalized_name": "Siberian Federal University", "country": "Russia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05fw97k56", "GRID": "grid.412592.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": "0", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
