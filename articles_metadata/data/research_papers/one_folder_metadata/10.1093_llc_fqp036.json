Using a Variable Length n-Gram Feature Extraction Algorithm, principal component analysis and average linkage clustering we are able to show that 24 sutras, attributed by the tradition to different translators, were in fact translated by the same translator or group of translators. Since part of our method is based on assigning weight to n-grams, the analysis is capable of yielding distinctive features, i.e. strings of Chinese characters, that are characteristic of the translator(s). This is the first time that these techniques have successfully been applied to medieval Chinese texts. The results of this study open up a number of new directions for the lexicographic and syntactic study of early Chinese translations of Buddhist texts.", "article_title": "Quantitative evidence for a hypothesis regarding the attribution of early Buddhist translations", "authors": [{"given": " Jen-Jou", "family": "Hung", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Library and Information Center, Dharma Drum Buddhist College, Taiwan, ROC", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Marcus", "family": "Bingenheimer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Library and Information Center, Dharma Drum Buddhist College, Taiwan, ROC", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Simon", "family": "Wiles", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Library and Information Center, Dharma Drum Buddhist College, Taiwan, ROC", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "25", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
