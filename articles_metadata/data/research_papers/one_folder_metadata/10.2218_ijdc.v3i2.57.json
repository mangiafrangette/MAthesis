It describes a number of salient data characteristics that are specific to the LTER program and outlines some central features of the curation approach cultivated within the US LTER network. It goes on to identify recent developments within the international LTER program relating to data issues: increasing heterogeneities due to networking, integration of data from additional disciplines, and new technologies in a changing digital landscape. Information management experience within LTER provides one example of the recurrent balancing inherent to the work of data curation. It highlights (1) taking into account the extended temporal horizon of data care, (2) aligning support for data, science and information infrastructure, and (3) integrating site and network-level responsibilities. LTER contributes to the inquiry into how to manage the continuity of digital data and to our understanding of how to design a sustainable information infrastructure.", "article_title": "Digital Data Practices and the Long Term Ecological Research Program Growing Global", "authors": [{"given": "Helena", "family": "Karasti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Oulu, Finland", "normalized_name": "University of Oulu", "country": "Finland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03yj89h83", "GRID": "grid.10858.34"}}]}, {"given": "Karen S.", "family": "Baker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of California, San Diego, USA", "normalized_name": "California Coast University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05t99sp05", "GRID": "grid.468726.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
