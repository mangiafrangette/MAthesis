This algorithm supports a useful degree of conditional branching while minimizing the training data fragmentation typical of decision trees. Classifications are based on a rich set of collocational, morphological and syntactic contextual features, extracted automatically from training data and weighted sensitive to the nature of the feature and feature class. The algorithm is evaluated comprehensively in the SENSEVAL framework, achieving the top performance of all participating supervised systems on the 36 test words where training data is available.", "article_title": "Hierarchical Decision Lists for Word Sense Disambiguation", "authors": [{"given": "David", "family": "Yarowsky", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Dept. of Computer Science and Center for Language and Speech Processing, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA", "normalized_name": "Johns Hopkins University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00za53h95", "GRID": "grid.21107.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
