In order to discover new knowledge from massive amounts of information, support of information technologies is required. For supporting knowledge discovery from vast amount of books, we developed an OCR-based automatic book-digitizing framework and the system visualizing documents with relationships among them calculated by using NLP techniques. We applied the framework to Japanese journal Shisō (“Thought”) by the Japanese publisher Iwanami Shoten. We show an example of knowledge structure extracted from Shisō by using our visualizing system.", "article_title": "Revealing the Modern History of Japanese Philosophy Using Digitization, Natural Language Processing, and Visualization", "authors": [{"given": "Katsuya", "family": "Masuda", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Center for Research and Development of Higher Education, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Makoto", "family": "Tanji", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Center for Knowledge Structuring, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Hideki", "family": "Mima", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo", "normalized_name": "University of Tokyo", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/057zh3y96", "GRID": "grid.26999.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "date": "2015-09-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2188-7276", "type": "electronic"}]}
