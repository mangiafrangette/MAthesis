LEME is larger in scope, but the reasons for undertaking it remain the same. Language commentary written by Early Modern English lexicographers usefully supplements the OED, as an examination of selected word-entries in John Florio's first Italian-English lexicon (1598) shows. Editorial annotation of works of the period also can glean much from LEME sources. By comparing traditional editorial glosses to Shakespeare's Cymbeline, II.i.15-34, to what early lexicons supply, we can see how unmodern his language was, and how it is (in minutiae) still misunderstood.", "article_title": "The Lexicons of Early Modern English", "authors": [{"given": "Ian", "family": "Lancashire", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, University of Toronto", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2003", "keywords": ["Lexicons of Early Modern English, Renaissance, lexicon, dictionary, Shakespeare, Cymbeline, John Florio, Randle Cotgrave, database, editing, definition"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
