Imagery has become an integral part of the reception and interpretation of the text. To date, a comprehensive collection of these images, the textual iconography of the Quixote, has not been published. We report in this paper on overcoming two key obstacles: limitations on the availability of materials and limitations due to the technical and financial characteristics of print-based dissemination. Our digital iconography makes a rich artistic tradition accessible to readers for the first time, and reveals a wealth of information about the historical, cultural, and literary contexts into which the Quixote has been placed.", "article_title": "Visual Knowledge: Textual Iconography of the Quixote, a Hypertextual Archive", "authors": [{"given": " Eduardo", "family": "Urbina", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Richard", "family": "Furuta", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Steven Escar", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Neal", "family": "Audenaert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Jie", "family": "Deng", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Carlos", "family": "Monroy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2006", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "21", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
