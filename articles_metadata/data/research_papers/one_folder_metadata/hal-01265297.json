The work described in this paper extends this approach to the publication of gnomologia (anthologies of wise sayings) , which formed a widespread literary genre in many cultures of the medieval Mediterranean. These texts are challenging because they were rarely copied straightforwardly ; rather , sayings were selected , reorganised , modified or re-attributed between manuscripts , resulting in a highly interconnected corpus for which a standard approach to digital publication is insufficient. Focusing on Greek and Arabic collections , we address this challenge using semantic web techniques to create an ecosystem of texts , relationships and annotations , and consider a new model – organic , collaborative , interconnected , and open-ended – of what constitutes an edition. This semantic web-based approach allows scholars to add their own materials and annotations to the network of information and to explore the conceptual networks that arise from these interconnected sayings .", "article_title": "Computer - Assisted Processing of Intertextuality in Ancient Languages", "authors": [{"given": "Mark", "family": "Hedges", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King‘s College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Anna", "family": "Jordanous", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Kent [Canterbury]", "normalized_name": "University of Kent", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00xkeyj56", "GRID": "grid.9759.2"}}]}, {"given": "K.
