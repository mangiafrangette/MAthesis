CTL’s objective is to investigate the complex structure of relationships between the linguistic and the figurative code in literary tradition, paying particular attention to the XVth, XVIth and XVIIth centuries and using information technologies both as an auxiliary research tool and as a medium for scientific dissemination. Here I shall be discussing the Centre’s digitalization projects, and in particular the project concerned with the Orlando Furioso and its remediation into images. This project, active since 2007, is, I believe, particularly representative of the progressive implementation within CTL of both traditional and computer-related methodologies in the planning of digital collections dedicated to words and images.", "article_title": "The digital collections of words and images of the CTL - Scuola Normale Superiore: the case of Orlando Furioso", "authors": [{"given": "Serena", "family": "Pezzini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa", "normalized_name": "Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03aydme10", "GRID": "grid.6093.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2013-08-12", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Humanist Studies & the Digital Age", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
