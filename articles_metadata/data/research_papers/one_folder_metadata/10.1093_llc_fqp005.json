The MONK (Metadata Offer New Knowledge) Project has developed both a common format, TEI Analytics (a TEI subset designed to facilitate interoperability of text archives) and a command-line tool, Abbot, that performs the conversion. Abbot relies upon a new technique, schema harvesting, developed by the author to convert text documents into TEI-A. This article has two aims: first, to describe the TEI-A format itself and, second, to outline the methods used to convert files. More generally, it is hoped that the techniques described will lead to greater interoperability of text documents for text analysis in a wider context.", "article_title": "TEI Analytics: converting documents into a TEI format for cross-collection text analysis", "authors": [{"given": " Brian L.", "family": "Pytlik Zillig", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009-04-15", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
