Using codicological evidence, the discussion connects these two material witnesses to literary trends of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the period in which the manuscripts were prepared. This article approaches each witness as a unique iteration of the Huon d’Auvergne epic and argues that the Barbieri witness, even though fragmentary, should not be overlooked in an attempt to understand the literary culture of this epic.", "article_title": "A Contextual Analysis of Two Huon d’Auvergne Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": "Stephen P.", "family": "McCormick", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Washington and Lee University", "normalized_name": "Lee University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fwhaq79", "GRID": "grid.259012.d"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2017-01-22", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "5", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
