This is achieved by means of a fast chart parser, which takes as input a grammar and a search expression specified by the user. Gsearch features a modular architecture that can be extended straightforwardly to give access to new corpora. The Gsearch architecture also allows interfacing with external linguistic resources (such as taggers and lexical databases). Gsearch can be used with graphical tools for visualizing the results of a query.", "article_title": "Finding Syntactic Structure in Unparsed Corpora: \"The Gsearch Corpus Query System\"", "authors": [{"given": "Steffan", "family": "Corley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Sharp Laboratories of Europe, Oxford Science Park", "normalized_name": "Sharp Laboratories of Europe (United Kingdom)", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0075mfb88", "GRID": "grid.422144.5"}}]}, {"given": "Martin", "family": "Corley", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Psychology and Human Communication Research Centre, University of Edinburgh", "normalized_name": "University of Edinburgh", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01nrxwf90", "GRID": "grid.4305.2"}}]}, {"given": "Frank", "family": "Keller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems, Division of Informatics, University of Edinburgh", "normalized_name": "University of Edinburgh", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01nrxwf90", "GRID": "grid.4305.2"}}]}, {"given": "Matthew W.", "family": "Crocker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Computational Linguistics, Saarland University", "normalized_name": "Saarland University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01jdpyv68", "GRID": "grid.11749.3a"}}]}, {"given": "Shari", "family": "Trewin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems, Division of Informatics, University of Edinburgh", "normalized_name": "University of Edinburgh", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01nrxwf90", "GRID": "grid.4305.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
