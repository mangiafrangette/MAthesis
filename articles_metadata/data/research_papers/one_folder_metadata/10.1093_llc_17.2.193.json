For the genealogical classification of these manuscripts, principal component analysis and cluster analysis, which describe the similarities between the verses of the different manuscripts, were applied to the data. As a result, we could successfully classify these manuscripts into two large groups and several smaller groups: one large group consists of ten paper manuscripts from Nepal and the other comprises nine palm‚Äêleaf plus two paper manuscripts. The Kashmir and Central Asian manuscripts and a few of the Nepal manuscripts belong to the small groups.", "article_title": "Genealogical Classification of Saddharmapundarika Manuscripts Based on Many-Variable Analysis", "authors": [{"given": "Y.", "family": "Ousaka", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "17", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
