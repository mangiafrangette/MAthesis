Without underestimating its importance, this paper aims at showing another advantage of monolingual corpora: the comparison of the behaviour of different word‐forms derived from the same lexeme. Two corpora have been chosen to illustrate this point, COBUILD's Bank of English and CREA (Reference Corpus of Contemporary Spanish), and two different but related case studies are thus presented by way of examples. Apparently, the differences between the variants selected in each language concern only gender and number, as is the case with the Spanish samples, or they are compounds with synonymous meanings, as happens with the English examples. But the observation of the data from the corpora has revealed some relevant characteristics concerning frequency rates and functions that contradict, in a considerable number of cases, our initial expectations—the assumption that all the forms of a lexeme differ from one another only formally (in the case of Spanish because of grammatical agreement) but not in their uses and meanings.", "article_title": "The Role of Corpora in the Study of Paradigmatic Relations; the Cases of COBUILD's Bank of English and CREA (Reference Corpus of Contemporary Spanish)", "authors": [{"given": "B.
