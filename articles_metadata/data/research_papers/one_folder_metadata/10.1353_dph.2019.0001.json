First, it argues that these dreams form a coherent, important program in the work as a whole, directly linked to the structure of its narrative. Secondly, it argues that this program functions in part by referring to a similar oneiric program in the thirteenth-century Roman de la Rose, in terms of the (ambiguous) meaning of dreams as fictional discourse.", "article_title": "The Dream Program in Paris et Vienne and Its Relation with the Roman de la Rose", "authors": [{"given": "Kevin", "family": "Brownlee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Pennsylvania", "normalized_name": "University of Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00b30xv10", "GRID": "grid.25879.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
