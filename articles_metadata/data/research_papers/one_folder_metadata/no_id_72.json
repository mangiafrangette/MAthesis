{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Many ends of editing in the digital world may be distinguished. One may speak of end as in the supersession of one model of editing (the intentionalist, definitive-text model) by another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned views enabled by digital methods). One may speak of end as in aim: not only the aim of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors. These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States. The essay concludes that a huge shift is indeed underway in the editing world, towards a more open and participatory model of editing and reading.
