{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " What does the category of the literary give to digital humanities? Nothing and everything. This essay considers the \"idiocy\" of the literary: its unaccountable singularity, which guarantees that we continue to return to it as a source, inspiration, and challenge. As a consequence, digital humanities is inspired and irritated by the literary. My essay shows this in three ways. First, through a speculative exploration of the relation between digital humanities and the category of \"the literary.\" Second, through a quick survey of the use of literature in digital humanities project. Thirdly, through a specific examination of TEI and character rendering as digital humanities concerns that necessarily engage with the literary. Once again, the literary remains singular and not abstract, literal in a way that challenges and provokes us towards new digital humanities work.
