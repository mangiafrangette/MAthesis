Each engaged the manuscript in different ways: the first had prior knowledge of its contents, the second used the text to teach himself English history, and the third mined the chronicle as a primary source for facts. Together, these readers provide insight into why a medieval chronicle—outdated in content and manuscript form—would continue to attract the attention of early modern readers.", "article_title": "Echoes in the Margins: Reading the Dartmouth Brut in Early Modern England", "authors": [{"given": "Emily", "family": "Ulrich", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Yale University", "normalized_name": "Yale University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03v76x132", "GRID": "grid.47100.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
