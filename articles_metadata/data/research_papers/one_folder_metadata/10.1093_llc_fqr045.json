Through the Python Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al., 2009, Natural Language Processing with Python. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media), I implemented a Na√Øve Bayes classifier that in effect treats each occurrence of a second-person pronoun as a black box that must be resolved into either a y- pronoun or a th- pronoun based only on the surrounding words. Using tenfold cross-validation, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 78.3% when fellow th- and y- pronouns are excluded from the context and 88.0% when we allow fellow th- and y- pronouns to assist in classification. Most interesting, however, are the context words that prove most informative in categorizing the pronouns. Significantly, the words most useful in classifying a pronoun as a y- pronoun include high-register words such as lordship, madam, lords, and sir. After a group of conjugated second-person verbs like art and wert, the words most associated with th- pronouns are words such as torment, nuncle, lesser, and villain. The ability to discriminate between forms based only on context confirms the hypothesis that the two classes of second-person pronoun are indeed used distinctly in the Shakespearean corpus. The list of words most helpful in making that distinction strongly suggests a difference in formality. We can also gain additional insight into the plays by examining some of the unexpected words that collocate with either one form or the other.", "article_title": "A Naive Bayes classifier for Shakespeare's second-person pronoun", "authors": [{"given": " Kyle", "family": "Mahowald", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Cambridge MA 02139, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2011-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "27", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
