The presented metric is effective at comparing named entity data in and across syntaxless data schemas such as are often encountered in Gallery, Library, Archive, and Museum collections. The efficiency of the approach was compared to an existing named entity similarity metric and is shown to be a significant improvement when comparing messy named entity data.", "article_title": "An effective named entity similarity metric for comparing data from multiple sources with varying syntax", "authors": [{"given": " David", "family": "Croft", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Computing, Electronics and Maths, Coventry University, UK", "normalized_name": "Coventry University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tgmhj36", "GRID": "grid.8096.7"}}]}, {"given": " Stephen", "family": "Brown", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Knowledge Media and Design, De Montfort University, UK", "normalized_name": "De Montfort University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0312pnr83", "GRID": "grid.48815.30"}}]}, {"given": " Simon", "family": "Coupland", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computational Intelligence, De Montfort University, UK", "normalized_name": "De Montfort University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0312pnr83", "GRID": "grid.48815.30"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016-08-28", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
