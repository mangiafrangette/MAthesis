The ability to create such an edition has been hampered in the past by the inability of HTML to express the semantic richness of TEI XML. However, by adopting the new semantic tags, custom data attributes, and schema.org microdata introduced with HTML5, an interoperable digital social edition can be feasible. The Grub Street Project, an edition of books, pamphlets, and data from 18th-century London, is a test of this premise.", "article_title": "The Grub Street Project: A digital social edition of London in the long 18th century", "authors": [{"given": " Allison", "family": "Muri", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "normalized_name": "University of Saskatchewan", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/010x8gc63", "GRID": "grid.25152.31"}}]}, {"given": " Catherine", "family": "Nygren", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McGill University, Canada", "normalized_name": "McGill University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01pxwe438", "GRID": "grid.14709.3b"}}]}, {"given": " Benjamin", "family": "Neudorf", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016-03-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "31", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
