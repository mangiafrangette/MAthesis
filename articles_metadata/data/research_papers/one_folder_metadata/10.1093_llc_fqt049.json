It pays special attention to different ontological conceptions (event based versus object based). It also discusses how best to model, within the ontology, conflicting views emerging in both Wittgenstein’s work and Wittgenstein scholarship. The contribution presents relevant work in progress at the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen, which has a special focus on Wittgenstein’s Nachlass, his philosophical estate.", "article_title": "Sharing and debating Wittgenstein by using an ontology", "authors": [{"given": " Alois", "family": "Pichler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Amélie", "family": "Zöllner-Weber", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
