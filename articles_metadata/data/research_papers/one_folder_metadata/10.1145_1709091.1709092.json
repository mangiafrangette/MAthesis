Nevertheless, especially in low-end cameras integrated flash lights are considered as not reliable for high-quality images, due to known artifacts (sharp shadows, highlights, uneven lighting) generated in images. Moreover, a mathematical model of this kind of light is difficult to create. In this article we present a color correction space which, given some information about the geometry of the pictured scene, is able to provide a space-dependent color correction for each pixel of the image. The correction space can be calculated once in a lifetime using a quite fast acquisition procedure; after 3D spatial calibration, the obtained color correction function can be applied to every image where flash is the dominant light source. We developed this approach to produce better color samples in the application framework of color mapping on 3D scanned models. The correction space proposed presents several advantages: it is independent from the kind of light used (provided that it is bound to the camera), it gives the possibility to correct some artifacts (for example, color deviation) introduced by flash light, and it has a wide range of possible applications, from image enhancement to material color estimation. Moreover, once that the inverse photo-to-geometry transformation is known, it allows the easy estimation of the flash light position and permits to identify and remove other annoying artifacts, like highlights and shadows. The resulting approach allows to gather in an easy manner a better and more consistent color information and to produce higher-quality 3D models.", "article_title": "Improved color acquisition and mapping on 3D models via flash-based photography", "authors": [{"given": "M.", "family": "Dellepiane", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR Pisa Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "M.", "family": "Callieri", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR Pisa Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "M.", "family": "Corsini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR Pisa Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "P.", "family": "Cignoni", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR Pisa Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "R.", "family": "Scopigno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ISTI-CNR Pisa Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2010", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "2", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
