By providing ample illustration of the difficulties encountered in the making of a catalogue of medieval Catalan translations, we first consider different cataloguing criteria in order to discuss the suitability of the database format vis-à-vis that of a PDF document. Secondly, through the former discussion we bring forth three main questions for the study of medieval translation in general, namely: autor-ship, mediation, and transmission. The third question elicits our philological discussion of what constitutes a translation and how we may distinguish different translations or versions of a same work.", "article_title": "Reflections on the Making of a Census of Medieval Catalan Translations", "authors": [{"given": "Montserrat", "family": "Ferrer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona", "normalized_name": "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052g8jq94", "GRID": "grid.7080.f"}}]}, {"given": "Lluís", "family": "Cabré", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona", "normalized_name": "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052g8jq94", "GRID": "grid.7080.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
