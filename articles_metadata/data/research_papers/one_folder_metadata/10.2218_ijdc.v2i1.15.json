They are available in many formats, most often constituting small electronic files that are made freely downloadable from academic web pages. However there are several challenges associated with how occupational information resources are distributed to, and exploited by, social researchers. In this paper we describe features of occupational information resources, and indicate the role digital curation can play in exploiting them. We report upon the strategies used in the GEODE research project (Grid Enabled Occupational Data Environment1). This project attempts to develop long-term standards for the distribution of occupational information resources, by providing a standardized framework-based electronic depository for occupational information resources, and by providing a data indexing service, based on e-Science middleware, which collates occupational information resources and makes them readily accessible to non-specialist social scientists.", "article_title": "Data Curation Standards and Social Science Occupational Information Resources", "authors": [{"given": "Paul", "family": "Lambert", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Stirling", "normalized_name": "University of Stirling", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/045wgfr59", "GRID": "grid.11918.30"}}]}, {"given": "Vernon", "family": "Gayle", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Stirling", "normalized_name": "University of Stirling", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/045wgfr59", "GRID": "grid.11918.30"}}]}, {"given": "Larry", "family": "Tan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Stirling", "normalized_name": "University of Stirling", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/045wgfr59", "GRID": "grid.11918.30"}}]}, {"given": "Ken", "family": "Turner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Stirling", "normalized_name": "University of Stirling", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/045wgfr59", "GRID": "grid.11918.30"}}]}, {"given": "Richard", "family": "Sinnott", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Glasgow", "normalized_name": "University of Glasgow", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00vtgdb53", "GRID": "grid.8756.c"}}]}, {"given": "Ken", "family": "Prandy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Cardiff ", "normalized_name": "Cardiff University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kk7td41", "GRID": "grid.5600.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
