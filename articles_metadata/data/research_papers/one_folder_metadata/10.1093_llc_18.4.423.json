Ngram measures can be used to accurately assign authorship for long documents such as novels. A number of 5 (authors) Ã— 5 (movies) arrays of movie reviews were acquired from the Internet Movie Database. Both ngram and naive Bayes classifiers were used to classify along both the authorship and topic (movie) axes. Both approaches yielded similar results, and authorship was as accurately detected, or more accurately detected, than topic. Part of speech tagging and function-word lists were used to investigate the influence of structure on classification tasks on documents with meaning removed but grammatical structure intact.", "article_title": "Ngram and Bayesian Classification of Documents for Topic and Authorship", "authors": [{"given": "Ross", "family": "Clement", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Harrow School of Computer Science, University of Westminster, UK ", "normalized_name": "University of Westminster", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04ycpbx82", "GRID": "grid.12896.34"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Sharp", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Harrow School of Computer Science, University of Westminster, UK ", "normalized_name": "University of Westminster", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04ycpbx82", "GRID": "grid.12896.34"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "18", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
