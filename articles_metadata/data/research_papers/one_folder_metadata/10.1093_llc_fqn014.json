I argue for the fundamental nature of modelling to these humanities and describe three varieties: analytical, synthetic and improvisational. I argue that these three kinds are distributed unevenly over the affected fields according to the degree to which each primarily reports on its objects of study, interprets them or invents new genres of expression. The changes in the disciplines are of course incrementalâ€”old things done better, more thoroughly and so forth. But what requires our attention and effort is the refiguration of them, of disciplinarity itself and of the conflicted economies in which academic work is increasingly taking place. I conclude by recommending that the institutional structures we build for the digital humanities should reflect the nature of the practice as it has emerged in the last few decades.", "article_title": "What's going on?", "authors": [{"given": " Willard", "family": "McCarty", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London, London, UK", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2008-10-23", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "23", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
