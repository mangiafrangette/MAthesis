We focus here on the technical challenges in order to discuss both the problems encountered in this particular context and the solutions we have considered and explored. We illustrate our discussion with examples from an Oral Stories Database we developed in collaboration with Cree education consultants and speakers in 2002-2004. We advocate an approach that includes fast-prototyping, open-source development, and database engine design that balances speed, availability, features and resources.", "article_title": "The eastcree.org Web Databases: Participatory Action Research with Information Technology", "authors": [{"given": "Marie-Odile", "family": "Junker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Cognitive Science, Carleton University", "normalized_name": "Carleton University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02qtvee93", "GRID": "grid.34428.39"}}]}, {"given": "Radu", "family": "Luchian", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Institute of Cognitive Science, Carleton University", "normalized_name": "Carleton University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02qtvee93", "GRID": "grid.34428.39"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2009", "keywords": ["Oral stories database, participatory action research, information technology, aboriginal language preservation"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
