The present article addresses this issue by engineering a computational model of the relevant task understood as that of composing a narrative discourse for the events in a chess game. The task of narrative composition is modelled as a set of operations that need to be carried out to obtain a span of narrative discourse from a set of events that inspire the narration. The model explores a set of intermediate representations required to capture the structure that is progressively imposed on the material, and connects this content planning task with a classic pipeline for natural language generation. Several strategies are explored for the linearization procedure and for the evaluation of its results. Additionally, the article considers this productive task immersed in a self-evaluation cycle where the produced discourse is validated via the construction of a possible interpretation (based exclusively on the information available in the discourse itself) and a comparison between this interpretation and the original source material.", "article_title": "Composing narrative discourse for stories of many characters: A case study over a chess game", "authors": [{"given": " Pablo", "family": "Gerv√°s", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid", "normalized_name": "Complutense University of Madrid", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02p0gd045", "GRID": "grid.4795.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014-08-22", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
