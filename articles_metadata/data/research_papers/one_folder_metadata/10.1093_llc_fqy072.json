This research not only demystifies the buzz term of ‘soft power’ that is frequently applied in relation to contemporary museums and their international cultural engagements but also develops an evaluation framework to assess museum capacities to exert global impacts. Specifically, the article draws on the academic scholarship outlining a plethora of approaches for ‘soft power’ evaluation, including Resources, Outputs, Perceptions, and Networks evaluation models. It argues for a new integrative approach that can comprehensively combine different methods to construct a more advanced tool to measure museum ‘soft power’. The article draws on preliminary results of developing a digital mapping system to assess museum soft power. It shares findings from the pilot project, Australian Center of the Moving Image (ACMI) on the Global Map, designed in collaboration with the ACMI in Melbourne.", "article_title": "Mapping museum ‘Soft Power’: Adding geo-visualization to the methodological framework", "authors": [{"given": " Natalia", "family": "Grincheva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Research Unit in Public Cultures, The University of Melbourne, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ej9dk98", "GRID": "grid.1008.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
