We focus on ‘Sendratari Ramayana’, a 50-year-old dance form heavily influenced by classical Javanese dance traditions dating back to the 19th century. We used a full-body plug-in gait model to record differences in character typology—a key concern of Javanese dance scholarship. The results are presented through online visualizations and analyzed quantitatively. This approach outlines a digital stylometry of movement that contributes to the long tradition of formalist analysis of Javanese dance.", "article_title": "Digital dance scholarship: Biomechanics and culturally situated dance analysis", "authors": [{"given": " Miguel", "family": "Escobar Varela", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "English Language and Literature, National University of Singapore, Singapore", "normalized_name": "National University of Singapore", "country": "Singapore", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tgyzw49", "GRID": "grid.4280.e"}}]}, {"given": " Luis", "family": "Hernández-Barraza", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore", "normalized_name": "National University of Singapore", "country": "Singapore", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01tgyzw49", "GRID": "grid.4280.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-12-27", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
