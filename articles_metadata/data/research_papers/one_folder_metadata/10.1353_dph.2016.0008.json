More than half of the 155 items were composed by Eustache Deschamps, and most of the remainder are anonymous, but the collection has a markedly didactic character and many pieces make political allusions. The manuscript thus sets Machaut’s love poems in an unusual context. This essay argues that reading these poems as presented in the anthology enables the modern reader to approximate a medieval reading experience.", "article_title": "‘Anonymous’ Machaut: Guillaume de Machaut in Paris, BnF, NAF 6221", "authors": [{"given": "Maureen", "family": "Boulton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Notre Dame", "normalized_name": "University of Notre Dame", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00mkhxb43", "GRID": "grid.131063.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
