It draws on the semantic primes of the natural semantic metalanguage, the theoretical constructs of semantic space, and force dynamics as well as semantic maps based on graph theory. In the semantic map, graphs link poles to definiens and lexical nodes, in such a way that the centrality of the poles is indicated, quantitatively, by the number of edges and, qualitatively, by the distance between the pole that exerts the centrifugal force and the pole to which such a force is directed. The conclusion is reached that the semantic poles MOVE, BE, and SAY constitute the core of the verbal lexicon of Old English, considering the semantic space that they occupy and the centrifugal and centripetal forces that produce polysemy originating in these semantic poles.", "article_title": "The semantic poles of Old English: Toward the 3D representation of complex polysemy", "authors": [{"given": " Javier ", "family": "Mart√≠n Arista", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universidad de La Rioja", "normalized_name": "University of La Rioja", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0553yr311", "GRID": "grid.119021.a"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "33", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
