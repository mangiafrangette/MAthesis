Only if these prerequisites are fulfilled can research data be used as a source for other projects. In addition, reliability is a fundamental requirement so that digital sources can be cited, reused, and quoted. To address this problem, we present our solution: the Data and Service Center for the Humanities located in Switzerland. The centralized infrastructure is based on flexible and extendable software that is in turn reliant on modern technologies. Such an approach allows for the straightforward migration of existing research project databases with limited life spans in the humanities. We will demonstrate the basic concepts behind this proposed solution and our first experiences in the application thereof.", "article_title": "DASCH: Data and Service Center for the Humanities", "authors": [{"given": " Lukas", "family": "Rosenthaler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Humanities Lab, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Basel", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02s6k3f65", "GRID": "grid.6612.3"}}]}, {"given": " Peter", "family": "Fornaro", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Humanities Lab, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Basel", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02s6k3f65", "GRID": "grid.6612.3"}}]}, {"given": " Claire", "family": "Clivaz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Lausanne, Ladhul, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, VITAL-IT, Lausanne (CH), Switzerland ", "normalized_name": "University of Lausanne", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/019whta54", "GRID": "grid.9851.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
