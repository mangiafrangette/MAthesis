It documents the various ways in which family members orientate themselves to the usage of technology in this environment, with a particular focus on the work done to manage the tablet and facilitate the engagement of younger children with the narrative of the experience. These findings are considered in the broader context of the need to design experiences that cater to engagement by families as a whole. We conclude by motivating the need for technologies that are robust in light of regular disengagement and by family members, and which provide functionality to directly support facilitation work.", "article_title": "Families and Mobile Devices in Museums", "authors": [{"given": "S.", "family": "Rennick-egglestone", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Nottingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ee9ar58", "GRID": "grid.4563.4"}}]}, {"given": "P.", "family": "Brundell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Nottingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ee9ar58", "GRID": "grid.4563.4"}}]}, {"given": "B.", "family": "Koleva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Nottingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ee9ar58", "GRID": "grid.4563.4"}}]}, {"given": "S.", "family": "Benford", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Nottingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ee9ar58", "GRID": "grid.4563.4"}}]}, {"given": "M.", "family": "Roussou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Athens, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04gnjpq42", "GRID": "grid.5216.0"}}]}, {"given": "C.", "family": "Chaffardon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cité de l’Espace, Toulouse, France", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2016-05-22", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "9", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
