We present an ontology-based approach for designing a cultural heritage repository for that purpose. Since dance and music are recorded in multimedia format, we use Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) to encode the domain knowledge. We propose an architectural framework that includes a method to construct the ontology with a labeled set of training data and use of the ontology to automatically annotate new instances of digital heritage artifacts. The annotations enable creation of a semantic navigation environment in a cultural heritage repository. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach by constructing an ontology for the cultural heritage domain of Indian classical dance, and have developed a browsing application for semantic access to the heritage collection of Indian dance videos.", "article_title": "Nrityakosha", "authors": [{"given": "Anupama", "family": "Mallik", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India", "normalized_name": "Indian Institute of Technology Jammu", "country": "India", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02f0vsw63", "GRID": "grid.499272.3"}}]}, {"given": "Santanu", "family": "Chaudhury", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India", "normalized_name": "Indian Institute of Technology Jammu", "country": "India", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02f0vsw63", "GRID": "grid.499272.3"}}]}, {"given": "Hiranmay", "family": "Ghosh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Tata Consultancy Services, India", "normalized_name": "Tata Consultancy Services (India)", "country": "India", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01b9n8m42", "GRID": "grid.452790.d"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "4", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
