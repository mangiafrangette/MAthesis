{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Typography, the arrangement and use of type, permeates our visual landscape, from printed pages and digital interfaces to physical environments and interactive experience. Those who study and work in the digital humanities are called upon to make typographic choices everyday, yet few have any training in how to effectively design with type. Over the past several years, I have been involved in several initiatives that seek to help educate digital humanities scholars, technologists and students about the value of information design, including typography. This paper will discuss these experiences and some guiding principles for helping a digital humanities audience understand the basic principles of typography and apply them to their projects and research.
