{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " This article argues that digital humanities projects can promote social change, collaboration, equity, and creativity through a focus on pedagogy in the undergraduate classroom. We analyze a pedagogical project that overtly set out to challenge structures of power and privilege in the undergraduate classroom through the use of an open-source online learning community. The Futures Initiative Commons in a Box site was developed and modified by the university faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students that make up the community of users. This learning community invites undergraduate and graduate students to become active knowledge-producers who contribute to their own teaching and learning. As such, the site works to increase studentsâ€™ agency and reconfigure hierarchical relationships of power and knowledge.
