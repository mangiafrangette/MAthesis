The very exciting findings uncovered in this article may be seen as the first systematic large-scale investigation of the various morpho-syntactic patterns underpinning the evolution of Chinese lexis. In this article, we have made a ground-breaking investigation into the diverse lexical modes and patterns which have emerged and developed in each major period in Chinese history, in which the generation of corpus linguistic data and the subsequent computational statistical modelling have been essential.", "article_title": "A corpus-based study of lexical periodization in historical Chinese", "authors": [{"given": " Meng ", "family": "Ji", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Law, Tohoku University, Japan", "normalized_name": "Tohoku University", "country": "Japan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01dq60k83", "GRID": "grid.69566.3a"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2010-04-14", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "25", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
