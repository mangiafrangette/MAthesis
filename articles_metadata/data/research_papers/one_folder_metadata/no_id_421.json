The virtual presentation of the music and text manuscripts, letters, works of visual art, calendars, diaries, historical documents, programms, reviews, first editions, photographs, as well as audiovisual sources brings together both archival and editorial concerns. The attempt has been made since 1998 on the website of the Arnold Schönberg Center in Vienna to bundle the media formatting possibilities of these sources with a variety of technological strategies, so that the user can both reflect on unique things of the legacy, as well as see their contextual relevance. How these intermediate Internet databases, static websites, digital facsimiles, as well as music and spoken word audio files present a synopsis of one of the most unique œuvres of the cultural history of the 20th century is the topic of this contribution. A main focus lies on the presentation of the source and facsimile database of letters as well as on the online Critical Complete Edition of Arnold Schönberg’s Writings.", "article_title": "Archivierung und virtuelle Edition – Arnold Schönbergs Nachlass als offenes Archiv", "authors": [{"given": "Therese", "family": "Muxeneder", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Arnold Schönberg Center, Wien", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2006", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
