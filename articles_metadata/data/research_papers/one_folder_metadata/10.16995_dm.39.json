I argue that those who work with manuscripts should place a greater emphasis on creating digital noncritical editions that will capture traditionally lost transcription work, harness community expertise, and create a vast interdisciplinary textual archive. This article describes some key benefits of a Platonic web-based transcription tool that will encourage large-scale collaborative transcription and editing in order to make manuscripts much more visible, accessible, connectable, correctable, and usable.", "article_title": "New Textual Traditions from Community Transcription", "authors": [{"given": "Frederick W", "family": "Gibbs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "George Mason University", "normalized_name": "George Mason University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jqj7156", "GRID": "grid.22448.38"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "7", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.39"}
