Consistently, in homilies and poetry alike, declarations of unknowing mark out the supernatural, functioning as traditional poetic markers of wonder and awe. With declarations of unknowing as a case study, this paper proposes a network model for visualizing the relationship between motifs, texts, and traditional associations within the larger expressive economy of oral-traditional Old English poetics.", "article_title": "Beyond the Sun’s Setting: Webs of Unknowing in Old English", "authors": [{"given": "Alexandra", "family": "Bolintineanu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Toronto", "normalized_name": "University of Toronto", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03dbr7087", "GRID": "grid.17063.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2015-12-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "4", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
