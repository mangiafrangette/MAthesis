The core of our proposal describes a system of relatively autonomous lexical “crystals” that can, within the constraints of the relevant element’s definition, be combined to form complex structures for the description of morphological form, grammatical information, etymology, word-formation, and meaning for a lexical structure.", "article_title": "Consistent Modeling of Heterogeneous Lexical Structures", "authors": [{"given": "Laurent", "family": "Romary", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "INRIA (France)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Humboldt University (Berlin, Germany)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Werner", "family": "Wegstein", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012-11-05", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
