Hence, in 2001, the Parzival-Project, currently settled at the University of Berne, was grounded to present a new edition that would visualize the plurality of manuscript transmission by applying modern computer technology. The edition is based on digital transcriptions that are annotated according to a specifically developed markup-system. Due to the fact that the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) have become a standard for the annotation of digital editions it would be desirable to transform the Bernese project material into the TEI-code. The paper demonstrates what methods can be used to convert the data, and what problems might occur in the transformation process.", "article_title": "Standardisierung und proprietäre Annotation im Berner Parzival-Projekt.", "authors": [{"given": "Gabriel", "family": "Viehhauser", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universität Bern, Institut für Germanistik", "normalized_name": "University of Bern", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02k7v4d05", "GRID": "grid.5734.5"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
