The typical manual restoration can become a tedious and error-prone process, which also does not scale well. In recent years, many methods have been proposed for assisting the process, most of which target specialized object types or operate under very strict constraints. We propose a digital shape restoration pipeline consisting of proven, robust methods for automatic fragment reassembly and shape completion of generic three-dimensional objects of arbitrary type. In this pipeline, first we introduce a novel unified approach for handling the reassembly of objects from heavily damaged fragments by exploiting both fracture surfaces and salient features on the intact sides of fragments, when available. Second, we propose an object completion procedure based on generalized symmetries and a complementary part extraction process that is suitable for driving the fabrication of missing geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real-world fractured objects and software implemented as part of the European Union--funded PRESIOUS project, which is also available for download from the project site.", "article_title": "From Reassembly to Object Completion", "authors": [{"given": "Georgios", "family": "Papaioannou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": "Athens University of Economics and Business", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03s262162", "GRID": "grid.16299.35"}}]}, {"given": "Tobias", "family": "Schreck", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": "Graz University of Technology", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00d7xrm67", "GRID": "grid.410413.3"}}]}, {"given": "Anthousis", "family": "Andreadis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": "Athens University of Economics and Business", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03s262162", "GRID": "grid.16299.35"}}]}, {"given": "Pavlos", "family": "Mavridis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": "Graz University of Technology", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00d7xrm67", "GRID": "grid.410413.3"}}]}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Gregor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": "Graz University of Technology", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00d7xrm67", "GRID": "grid.410413.3"}}]}, {"given": "Ivan", "family": "Sipiran", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, San Miguel, Lima", "normalized_name": "Pontifical Catholic University of Peru", "country": "Peru", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00013q465", "GRID": "grid.440592.e"}}]}, {"given": "Konstantinos", "family": "Vardis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece", "normalized_name": "Athens University of Economics and Business", "country": "Greece", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03s262162", "GRID": "grid.16299.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "10", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
