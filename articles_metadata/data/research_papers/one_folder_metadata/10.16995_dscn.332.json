By extending computational methodologies in the digital humanities like macroanalysis and distant reading in the context of drones and surveillance, this article demonstrates how drone technologies alter established notions of war and peace, guilt and innocence, privacy and the common good; in doing so, the paper connects postcolonial studies to the digital humanities.", "article_title": "Drones and Surveillance Cultures in a Global World", "authors": [{"given": "John", "family": "Muthyala", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Southern Maine", "normalized_name": "University of Southern Maine", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03ke6tv85", "GRID": "grid.267189.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
