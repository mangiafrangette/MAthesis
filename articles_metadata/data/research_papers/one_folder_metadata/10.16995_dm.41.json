This paper discusses the computing, financing, and logistical challenges we faced in creating the database, as well as our solutions. The OMSB is aimed at a wide audience, from high school students to professors, so we have had to tailor our data to the needs of many different types of researcher, and to keep in mind all of the different ways someone might search for sources. Working with a very limited budget, we have made use of graduate and undergraduate students to provide both programming and data entry, a solution that has provided excellent research experience (and often much-needed funding) for the students involved.", "article_title": "Developing an Online Database on a Shoestring: Growing Pains at the Online Medieval Sources Bibliography", "authors": [{"given": "Morgan", "family": "Kay", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fordham University", "normalized_name": "Fordham University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qnxaf80", "GRID": "grid.256023.0"}}]}, {"given": "Maryanne", "family": "Kowaleski", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fordham University", "normalized_name": "Fordham University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qnxaf80", "GRID": "grid.256023.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-05-31", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "7", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.41"}
