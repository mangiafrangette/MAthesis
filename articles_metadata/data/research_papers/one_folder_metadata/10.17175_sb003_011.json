Reconstruction, Presentation, Installation started in the context of the DFG-funded Special Research Area Media Upheavals at the University of Siegen. It ended in 2009. In this project, art history, media studies, and computer science cooperated in order to ‘virtualize’ the complex sculptural ensembles of Gianlorenzo Bernini at the Villa Borghese in Rome. With the help of the scanned sculptures, reconstructed in a virtual model of the Villa Borghese, research questions in art history as well as regarding the theory of images were to be answered experimentally. Although the term was never used in the project itself, it is an early example for the field that is now called Digital Humanities – in the sense that digital technologies were not only used for the scientific work, but were also developed in the course of the project.", "article_title": "»Virtualisierung von Skulptur«.
