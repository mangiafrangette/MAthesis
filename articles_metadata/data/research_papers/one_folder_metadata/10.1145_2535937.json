Discussions in this article are based on our experiences in developing the Mao-Kung Cauldron time perception journey multimedia application. This installation was inspired by the Mao-Kung Cauldron, an ancient bronze cauldron in the collection of the National Palace Museum known for its historical significance. The question, however, lies in how to create an experience in which the audiences can interact with the past. To address this issue, the research team used the Kinect-based breath detection and deterioration/recovery simulation technologies to develop the application. This installation is the first application linked to Kinect-based breath detection and deterioration/recovery simulation technologies. The main contribution of this work is the analysis of design concepts, design decisions, and evaluations in a museum setting. We conduct a control group study to compare the outcomes between the experimental group (Mao-Kung Cauldron time perception journey multimedia application) and control group (asynchronous web-based kiosk). Both the quantitative (questionnaire survey) and qualitative methods (observation) are used to analyze the collected data. This work proposes a feasibility design to let museum audiences experience the features of cultural object by the virtual time perception journey application.", "article_title": "Interacting with the past", "authors": [{"given": "Chun-Ko", "family": "Hsieh", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Taiwan University and National Palace Museum, Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)", "normalized_name": "National Taiwan University", "country": "Taiwan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bqach95", "GRID": "grid.19188.39"}}]}, {"given": "Wen-Ching", "family": "Liao", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)", "normalized_name": "National Taiwan University", "country": "Taiwan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bqach95", "GRID": "grid.19188.39"}}]}, {"given": "Meng-Chieh", "family": "Yu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)", "normalized_name": "National Taiwan University", "country": "Taiwan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bqach95", "GRID": "grid.19188.39"}}]}, {"given": "Yi-Ping", "family": "Hung", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)", "normalized_name": "National Taiwan University", "country": "Taiwan", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bqach95", "GRID": "grid.19188.39"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "7", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
