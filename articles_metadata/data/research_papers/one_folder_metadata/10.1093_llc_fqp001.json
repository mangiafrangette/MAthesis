Drawing primarily on the example provided by the development of a TEI P5 conformant edition of Hafgeirs saga Flateyings, an alleged Icelandic saga forgery attested in a single, unsigned eighteenth century paper manuscript, this discussion explains how literary, linguistic, and transmission-level interpretations can be employed to describe the saga text and to bear witness to its origin and transmission process. It further explains how encoding the metadata described in these interpretations beside the data described in (near)zero-level text can be accomplished without sacrificing the role of the manuscript as artefact and without sacrificing the appearance of the text as it occurs on the page.", "article_title": "The TEI as luminol: Forensic philology in a digital age", "authors": [{"given": " Stephanie A.", "family": "Schlitz", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bloomsburg University, Bloomsburg, PA 17815, USA", "normalized_name": "Bloomsburg University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/007dga614", "GRID": "grid.253165.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
