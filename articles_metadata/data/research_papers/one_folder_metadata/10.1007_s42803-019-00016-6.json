It surveys issues in the creation of scholarly digital editions and the open licensing of resources and addresses concerns about underlying data models and vocabularies, such as the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative. It calls for solutions which promote the collaborative creation, annotation, and publication of scholarly digital editions. The article draws a line between issues with which editors of scholarly digital editions should concern themselves and issues which may only prove to be distractions.", "article_title": "Opening the book: data models and distractions in digital scholarly editing", "authors": [{"given": "James", "family": "Cummings", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Newcastle Australia", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00eae9z71", "GRID": "grid.266842.c"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
