Darwin's own stance in that matter is however open to debate, his rare use of the word making it hard to determine whether it is strictly specific or dual, and thus whether the author's conception of evolution is representative or ahead of its time. While this situation certainly stimulates philological, historical, and philosophical debates, it however complicates any attempt to settle the matter on a strict lexical basis, thus making standard text-mining techniques ineffective. To address this specific issue, a computer-assisted method for ‘reading Darwin between the lines’ is here attempted and described: by using an iterative concordance clustering algorithm, this approach aims at ‘digging’ into Darwin's concept of evolution as found in the sixth edition of the Origin of Species, regardless of any proper designation. In light of the results thus obtained, the concept of evolution in the sixth edition of the Origin of Species appears closer to its modern and strictly specific interpretation, inferences made to words related to embryological development being rather rare.", "article_title": "The concept of evolution in the Origin of Species: a computer-assisted analysis", "authors": [{"given": " Maxime B.", "family": "Sainte-Marie", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Laboratoire d'analyse cognitive de l'information (LANCI), Montreal, Quebec, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}, {"given": " Jean-Guy", "family": "Meunier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Laboratoire d'analyse cognitive de l'information (LANCI), Montreal, Quebec, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}, {"given": " Nicolas", "family": "Payette", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Laboratoire d'analyse cognitive de l'information (LANCI), Montreal, Quebec, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}, {"given": " Jean-François", "family": "Chartier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Laboratoire d'analyse cognitive de l'information (LANCI), Montreal, Quebec, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2011", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "26", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
