Information generated in the past is sent into the future by the current preservation environment. The proof that the preservation environment preserves authenticity and integrity while performing the communication constitutes a theory of digital preservation. We examine the representation information that is needed about the preservation environment for a theory of digital preservation. The representation information includes descriptions of the preservation management policies, the preservation processes, and the state information that is needed to verify the correct working behavior of the system. We demonstrate rule-based data grids that can verify that prior policies correctly enforced preservation properties, while sending into the future descriptions of the current preservation management policies.", "article_title": "Towards a Theory of Digital Preservation", "authors": [{"given": "Reagan", "family": "Moore", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "normalized_name": "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04mg3nk07", "GRID": "grid.419957.7"}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
