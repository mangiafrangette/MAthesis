With this multimedia application, termed di Piazza in Piazza, people have gotten in contact with several types of digital content about culinary traditions and local Italian products, simply using their hands. This design decision came after the acknowledgment that hands play a prominent role in the relationship between humans and food (think, for example, about the activities of eating and cooking). Studies of di Piazza in Piazza users have basically unveiled two results: (a) it was a really funny experience using hands and (b) narrations focusing on local products and traditions have mostly captivated the interest of visitors, thus confirming the strong cultural relationship among people, culinary traditions, and regional foods.", "article_title": "Handmade Narrations", "authors": [{"given": "Silvia", "family": "Mirri", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Bologna, Mura Anteo Zamboni, Bologna, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Bologna", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01111rn36", "GRID": "grid.6292.f"}}]}, {"given": "Catia", "family": "Prandi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Bologna", "normalized_name": "University of Bologna", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01111rn36", "GRID": "grid.6292.f"}}]}, {"given": "Marco", "family": "Roccetti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Bologna, Mura Anteo Zamboni, Bologna, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Bologna", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01111rn36", "GRID": "grid.6292.f"}}]}, {"given": "Paola", "family": "Salomoni", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Bologna, Mura Anteo Zamboni, Bologna, Italy", "normalized_name": "University of Bologna", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01111rn36", "GRID": "grid.6292.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2017-08-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "10", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
