It was designed for the annotation of CMC documents in the project Deutsches Referenzkorpus zur internetbasierten Kommunikation (DeRiK), which aims at building a corpus on language use in the most popular CMC genres on the German-speaking Internet. The focus of the schema is on those CMC genres which are written and dialogic―such as forums, bulletin boards, chats, instant messaging, wiki and weblog discussions, microblogging on Twitter, and conversation on “social network” sites.", "article_title": "A TEI Schema for the Representation of Computer-mediated Communication", "authors": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Beißwenger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TU Dortmund University", "normalized_name": "TU Dortmund University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k97gp34", "GRID": "grid.5675.1"}}]}, {"given": "Maria", "family": "Ermakova", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humboldt University Berlin", "normalized_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hcx6992", "GRID": "grid.7468.d"}}, {"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (BBAW)", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Alexander", "family": "Geyken", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (BBAW)", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Lothar", "family": "Lemnitzer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (BBAW)", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}, {"given": "Angelika", "family": "Storrer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "TU Dortmund University", "normalized_name": "TU Dortmund University", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01k97gp34", "GRID": "grid.5675.1"}}, {"original_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (BBAW)", "normalized_name": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05jgq9443", "GRID": "grid.420264.6"}}]}], "publisher": "OpenEdition", "date": "2012", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative", "volume": null, "issue": "Issue 3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-5603", "type": "electronic"}]}
