Most of this work currently receives little, if any, attention. The collection is too large to be read by any single person and mostly not of sufficient interest to warrant traditional close reading. This article presents computational methods for identifying patterns and testing hypotheses about Classics as a field. Such tools can help organize large collections, introduce younger scholars to the history of the field, and act as a “survey,” identifying anomalies that can be explored using more traditional methods.", "article_title": "Computational historiography", "authors": [{"given": "David", "family": "Mimno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Princeton University, Princeton, NJ", "normalized_name": "Princeton University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hx57361", "GRID": "grid.16750.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2012-05-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
