They also show that there is some kind of affinity between the Pastorals and the Petrine Epistles. Scalometric analysis suggests that this affinity is due to stylistic features. The identification of the linguistic features that separate the first four epistles from the Pastorals and the Petrines provides a method of distinguishing between two styles in the epistles. Differences that were previously thought to point to differences in authorship are now seen to refer to differences in style that may be found within the works of one author.", "article_title": "Two Styles in the New Testament Epistles", "authors": [{"given": "G.
