Based on user surveys, blog posts, and forum discussions, this article provides both an account and assessment of Web 2.0 technologies in use on a large-scale arts and humanities research project. Examining usage by and impressions of both the project team and the wider community of users, it investigates both the advantages gained and problems faced through the use of a virtual research environment (VRE). It also pays special attention to the use of video and its implications for research practices.
