The goal of the study is to determine the degree to which translation equivalents for different meanings of a polysemous word in English are lexicalized differently across a variety of languages, and to determine whether this information can be used to structure or create a set of sense distinctions useful in natural language processing applications. A coherence index is computed that measures the tendency for different senses of the same English word to be lexicalized differently, and from this data a clustering algorithm is used to create sense hierarchies.", "article_title": "Cross-Lingual Sense Determination: Can It Work?", "authors": [{"given": "Nancy", "family": "Ide", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, Vassar College, USA", "normalized_name": "Vassar College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/022x6qg61", "GRID": "grid.267778.b"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
