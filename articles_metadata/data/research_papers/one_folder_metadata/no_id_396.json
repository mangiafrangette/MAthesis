This is followed by reviewing steps taken with a view to the possible institutionalization of Computer Philology at Hamburg University. The above theoretical considerations, as well as the reference to the practical example will form the backdrop for reviewing three articles presented in recent years which have aimed to answer the question »What is Computer Philology?«. The contributions under discussion are seen to differ mainly with regard to the implications which they hold for Computer Philology's development into a discipline proper. The article's conclusion is that we ought to »Think Big» in Computer Philology and aspire to meet the criteria for disciplinarity which are considered an important scholarly benchmark.", "article_title": "»THINK BIG»: DISZIPLINARITÄT ALS WISSENSCHAFTSTHEORETISCHE BENCHMARK DER COMPUTERPHILOLOGIE", "authors": [{"given": "Jan Christoph", "family": "Meister", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Forschergrupper Narratologie, Institut für Germanistik II, Hamburg", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2002", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
