Its application potentials are discussed and tested in economy and science. Especially the transparency, traceability and unchangeability of the content stored in a blockchain and the decentralization are of particular interest. Potential areas of application that are also of interest for the humanities are discussed in this paper, especially the scientific publication of articles and research data as well as blockchain-based possibilities for signing published content. Based on the concrete example of a scientific journal, the functionality, potential application and caveats of blockchain will be explained and discussed.
