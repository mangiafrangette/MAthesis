These structural characteristics, so frustrating to many new readers of hypertext, can also be found in popular and experimental films. In particular, Godfrey Reggio's (1983) documentary Koyaanisqatsi provides a good starting point for merging hypertext and film theory. Koyaanisqatsi not only broke new ground for documentary film; its structure also resembles Landow's model for an axial hypertext. At the same time, techniques pioneered by Landow, Joyce, Guyer, and others involved in creating and critiquing hypertext can be used to examine film. Having students look closely at Koyaanisqatsi's composition allows them to become amateur cinematographers, who now possess software for breaking a film down and examining its composition, montage, transitions, subliminal messages, and motifs - a process that may then be applied to hypertext.", "article_title": "Film as \"Explicador\" for Hypertext", "authors": [{"given": "Joe", "family": "Essid", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Writing Center, University of Richmond, Richmond, VA 23173, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Richmond", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03y71xh61", "GRID": "grid.267065.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
