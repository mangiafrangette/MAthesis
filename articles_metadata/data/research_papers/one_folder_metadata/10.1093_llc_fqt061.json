Our aim is to determine the linguistic subgroupings of these languages, which we believe will shed light on their prehistory, highlight the linguistic diversity of these groups and which may ultimately inform studies on the cultural boundaries of these languages.", "article_title": "Investigating the relatedness of the endangered Dogon languages", "authors": [{"given": " Steven", "family": "Moran", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Marburg", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "University of Zurich", "normalized_name": "University of Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02crff812", "GRID": "grid.7400.3"}}]}, {"given": " Jelena", "family": "ProkiÄ‡", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Marburg", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
