As we argue here, digital-medieval manuscript culture is continually in process and changing, as our tools, like those of the Middle Ages, evolve. In order to theorize digital manuscript surrogates—which need not be facsimiles, but rather any digital text or object intended to represent the contents and/or physical presence of a manuscript—as hyper-remediations that foreground medieval technologies in new media, we consider five interrelated aspects of digital-medieval manuscript culture: likeness, tangibility, presence, time, and intention(s).", "article_title": "On Digital-Medieval Manuscript Culture: A Tentative Manifesto", "authors": [{"given": "Heather", "family": "Bamford", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The George Washington University", "normalized_name": "George Washington University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00y4zzh67", "GRID": "grid.253615.6"}}]}, {"given": "Emily C.", "family": "Francomano", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Georgetown University", "normalized_name": "Georgetown University", "country": "Qatar", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/029e47x73", "GRID": "grid.452129.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2018-08-12", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "7", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
