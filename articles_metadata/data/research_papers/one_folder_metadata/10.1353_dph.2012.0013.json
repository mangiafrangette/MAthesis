Initially depicted as impersonal manifestations of a divinely ordained world with labile frontiers between the natural and the supernatural, they become passionate beings, usually portrayed as envious, angry, and vengeful, with a particular animus towards morally upstanding humans. Concomitant with the portrayal of demonic emotion is the development of the first-person conversion narrative. This essay documents the evolution in the portrayal of demonic emotions across two key genres of the Latinate Middle Ages: the first-person life narratives of monks that began to appear in the twelfth century, and collections of miracle narratives from the twelfth to the thirteenth centuries. This progressive “personalization” of supernatural beings offers insight into Milton’s portrayal of Satan in Paradise Lost.", "article_title": "Sensitive Spirits: Changing Depictions of Demonic Emotions in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries", "authors": [{"given": "Juanita Feros", "family": "Ruys", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ARC Centre of Excellence for the History of Emotions", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Medieval and Early Modern Centre, University of Sydney", "normalized_name": "University of Sydney", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0384j8v12", "GRID": "grid.1013.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
