An earlier systematic attempt to encode these personifications was described in A.24 as “modelling”. In this paper the result, rather more a phenomenological description than a model, properly so-called, is taken as the basis for construction of a manipulable model. Instances of the abstract entity “fortuna” (fortune, luck, chance) are used to build a relational database of examples. For each example the causative factors are specified; wherever possible these factors are weighted globally to signify their degree of influence on the result. This database is linked to spreadsheet software to generate a chart of these instances in bar-graph format from a formula that computes the total effect of the causative factors. A mathematical function is provisionally introduced to provide more realistic results. Its limitations and directions for further research are discussed.", "article_title": "Depth, Markup and Modelling", "authors": [{"given": "Willard", "family": "McCarty", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2003", "keywords": ["modelling, personification, Ovid, Metamorphoses, databases, literary criticism"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
