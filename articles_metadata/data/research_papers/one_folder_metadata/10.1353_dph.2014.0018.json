Its omission of the stories of Constantine and Havelok—but inclusion of the story of Cadwallader—appears to represent a stage in the government’s revision of history. The stories of Constantine and Havelok would have been offensive to some since the first suggests a continuation of heroic kingship among the Welsh and the second an unflattering parallel to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who was attempting to control the government of the child-king Henry VI.", "article_title": "“History Repeats itself”: The Dartmouth Brut and Fifteenth-Century Historiography", "authors": [{"given": "Edward Donald", "family": "Kennedy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
