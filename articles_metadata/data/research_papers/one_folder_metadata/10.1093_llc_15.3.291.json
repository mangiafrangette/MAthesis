The Modern Greek language presents a high flexibility in its syntactic structure. The various phrasal categories (noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional, and adverbial phrases) can be ordered in almost any permutation so as to build valid sentences. The allowable combinations of lexical categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) forming the above phrases, as well as the combinations of these phrases, forming clauses, are encoded according to the PC-PATR formalism and are presented in this paper. The presented rules cover the majority of the syntactic phenomena of the Modern Greek language, adequate for speech and natural language applications.", "article_title": "A PC-PATR-Based syntactic description of modern Greek", "authors": [{"given": "K.", "family": "Kermanidis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
