Can computers interpret texts or do they aide in the interpretation? In this paper we propose variants on the Turing Test to imagine if computer-assisted interpretation is possible. We argue that a way forward for developing models for successful machine interpreters is to work with regular expression recognition and manipulation, which is built into most programming languages in a common fashion.", "article_title": "MIMes and MeRMAids: On the Possibility of Computer-aided Interpretation", "authors": [{"given": "Geoffrey", "family": "Rockwell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McMaster University", "normalized_name": "McMaster University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02fa3aq29", "GRID": "grid.25073.33"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005", "keywords": ["Humanities Computing, Computer-Assisted Text Analysis, Interpretation"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
