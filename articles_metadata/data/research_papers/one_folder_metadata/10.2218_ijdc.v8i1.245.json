Unfortunately, in the absence of corresponding data formats, test results are rarely conserved and their value diminishes as the material pedigree, test conditions, and results become disassociated. In an effort to address this issue, prenormative research has demonstrated the viability of deriving data formats from documentary testing standards and thus the possibility to realize a standards-based data infrastructure for the engineering materials community.", "article_title": "Prenormative Research into Standard Messaging Formats for Engineering Materials Data", "authors": [{"given": "Tim", "family": "Austin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy and Transport", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Chris", "family": "Bullough", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Alstom Power", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Dimitri", "family": "Gagliardi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Manchester", "normalized_name": "University of Manchester", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/027m9bs27", "GRID": "grid.5379.8"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Leal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CAESAR Systems", "normalized_name": "Caesar Systems (United Kingdom)", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03rt32119", "GRID": "grid.433042.2"}}]}, {"given": "Malcolm", "family": "Loveday", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Beta Technology", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2013-06-14", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
