From the definition of the requirements to the evaluation of the impact on teaching and research, the article stresses the importance of conceiving of techno-pedagogical tools as dynamic products, whose plasticity is a way to offset teething problems and apparent weaknesses.", "article_title": "IMPACT: A tool for transcribing and commenting on oral data, for teaching, learning, and research", "authors": [{"given": " Jérôme", "family": "Jacquin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Lausanne, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Lausanne", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/019whta54", "GRID": "grid.9851.5"}}, {"original_name": "Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand", "normalized_name": "Victoria University of Wellington", "country": "New Zealand", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0040r6f76", "GRID": "grid.267827.e"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2015-06-18", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "31", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
