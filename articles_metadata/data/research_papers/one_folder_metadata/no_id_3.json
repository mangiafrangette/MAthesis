Despite several initiatives over the years, there has been little success in developing text analysis tools collaboratively or in creating an interoperable framework for tools development. This article presents initial work towards a Text Analysis Markup Language (TAML) that would foster the distributed development of literary text analysis tools. Any standardization of a vocabulary requires difficult choices, but it also requires a potentially beneficial examination of the needs and practices of a community. TAML is both a technical specification and a product of sociological introspection", "article_title": "Toward Next Generation Text Analysis Tools: The Text Analysis Markup Language (TAML)", "authors": [{"given": "St√©fan", "family": "Sinclair", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McMaster University", "normalized_name": "McMaster University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02fa3aq29", "GRID": "grid.25073.33"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005", "keywords": ["Text analysis tools, interoperability, markup languages"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
