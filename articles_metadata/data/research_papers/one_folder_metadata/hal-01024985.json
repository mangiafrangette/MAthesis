Rather than considering the effect of deception on voters, deception is used as a lens through which to observe the self-perceptions of candidates and campaigns. The method of analysis is fully automated and requires no human coding, and so can be applied to many other domains in a straightforward way. The authors posit explanations for the observed variation in terms of a dynamic tension between the goals of campaigns at each moment in time, for example gaps between their view of the candidateâ€™s persona and the persona expected for the position; and the difficulties of crafting and sustaining a persona, for example, the cognitive cost and the need for apparent continuity with past actions and perceptions. The changes in the resulting balance provide a new channel by which to understand the drivers of political campaigning, a channel that is hard to manipulate because its markers are created subconsciously.", "article_title": "Deception in Speeches of Candidates for Public Office", "authors": [{"given": "David", "family": "Skillicorn", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of computing [Kingston]", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Christian", "family": "Leuprecht", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "RMCC - Royal Military College of Canada", "normalized_name": "Royal Military College of Canada", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04yr71909", "GRID": "grid.217211.6"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2015", "keywords": ["political discourse", "corpus analytics", "U.S. presidential elections", "deception", "singular value decomposition"], "journal_title": "Journal of Data Mining & Digital Humanities", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
