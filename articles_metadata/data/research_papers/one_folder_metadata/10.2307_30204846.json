First, the problem is described; then a generalised framework for software is presented that emphasises key stages that must be solved: staff line identification, musical object location, musical feature classification, and musical semantics. Next, significant research projects in the area are reviewed, showing how each fits the generalised framework. The article concludes by discussing perhaps the most open question in the field: how to compare the accuracy and success of rival systems, highlighting certain steps that help ease the task.", "article_title": "The Challenge of Optical Music Recognition", "authors": [{"given": "David", "family": "Bainbridge", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato", "normalized_name": "University of Waikato", "country": "New Zealand", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013fsnh78", "GRID": "grid.49481.30"}}]}, {"given": "Tim", "family": "Bell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, University of Canterbury", "normalized_name": "University of Canterbury", "country": "New Zealand", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03y7q9t39", "GRID": "grid.21006.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
