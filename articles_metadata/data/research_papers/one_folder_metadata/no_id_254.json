{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " A project is a basic unit of digital humanities (DH) scholarship, which suggests that DH as a discipline should pay more attention to project management, and perhaps to develop the project management models, principles, and methods that are more specific to the discipline. However, DH literature deals with this issue merely by listing the basic principles, or offering specific tips and tricks, which seriously simplifies management of DH projects. DH projects involve building (or at least using) digital tools, which brings the complex tensions between digital and humanistic aspects of these projects. In order to address such a complexity, there is a need for a model for managing DH projects that will learn from information studies and methods in software development, while still being based on values of the humanistic tradition and methods. This article combines a model of scholarly information practices with some concepts of agile software development into a hybrid model for managing DH projects.
