To separate clutter from acquired material, semiautomated methods are employed to generate masks used to segment the range maps and the color photographs. This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont’e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports. Color and shape were acquired at a resolution of 0.25mm, which resulted in more than 6,200 range maps (about 1.3G valid samples) and 3,817 photographs.", "article_title": "Mont’e Scan", "authors": [{"given": "Fabio", "family": "Bettio", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CRS4 Visual Computing, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Ruggero", "family": "Pintus", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CRS4 Visual Computing, Italy and Yale University, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Alberto Jaspe", "family": "Villanueva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CRS4 Visual Computing, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Emilio", "family": "Merella", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CRS4 Visual Computing, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Fabio", "family": "Marton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CRS4 Visual Computing, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Enrico", "family": "Gobbetti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "CRS4 Visual Computing, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2015", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
