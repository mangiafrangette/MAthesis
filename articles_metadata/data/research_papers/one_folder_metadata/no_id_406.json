It is not the task to transfer the records into ›edited texts‹ only, but to make them visible inside their topographic embedding. The Historisch-Kritische Gottfried Keller-Ausgabe (Historical-Critical Gottfried Keller Edition) complies with these requirements owing to the complete reproduction of the text witnesses and the complement of each hand written page with a diplomatic transcription. The computer edition on CD-ROM, issued with the book, intends to implement appropriately the interaction of hand writing and transcription as well within the electronic media. This specification includes, aside from a word by word parallelisation, also a search option for character strings, which spans the entire corpus of the text witnesses. Thus, the limitation to sole textual and graphic display, which still rules today's electronic media, is overcome.", "article_title": "GOTTFRIED KELLERS STUDIENBÜCHER - ELEKTRONISCH EDIERT", "authors": [{"given": "Walter", "family": "Morgenthaler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Basel, Schweiz", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
