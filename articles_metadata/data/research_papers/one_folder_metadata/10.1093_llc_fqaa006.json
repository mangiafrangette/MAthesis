In this article, principal component analysis and factor analysis were applied to cluster thirteen different given arrangements about the Suras of the Holy Quran. The results showed that these thirteen arrangements can be categorized in two parts such that the first part includes Blachère, Davood, Grimm, Nöldeke, Bazargan, E’temad-al-Saltane and Muir, and the second part includes Ebn Nadim, Jaber, Ebn Abbas, Hazrat Ali, Khazan, and Al-Azhar.", "article_title": "Statistical approaches in literature: An application of principal component analysis and factor analysis to analyze the different arrangements about the Quran’s Suras", "authors": [{"given": " Yanwen", "family": "Wang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Literature, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China", "normalized_name": "Shandong University", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0207yh398", "GRID": "grid.27255.37"}}]}, {"given": " Javad", "family": "Garjami", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Arabic Language and Literature, Faculty of Literature and Humanities, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabili, Iran", "normalized_name": "University of Mohaghegh Ardabili", "country": "Iran", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/045zrcm98", "GRID": "grid.413026.2"}}]}, {"given": " Milena", "family": "Tsvetkova", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Faculty of Journalism and Mass Communication, Sofia University, Sofia, Bulgaria", "normalized_name": "Sofia University", "country": "Bulgaria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02jv3k292", "GRID": "grid.11355.33"}}]}, {"given": " Nguyen", "family": "Huu Hau", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Training Management, Hong Duc University, Thanh Hoa City, Vietnam", "normalized_name": "Hồng Đức University", "country": "Vietnam", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05dp8mg49", "GRID": "grid.444885.1"}}]}, {"given": " Kim-Hung", "family": "Pho", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Fractional Calculus, Optimization and Algebra Research Group, Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "normalized_name": "Ton Duc Thang University", "country": "Vietnam", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01drq0835", "GRID": "grid.444812.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2020-01-29", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
