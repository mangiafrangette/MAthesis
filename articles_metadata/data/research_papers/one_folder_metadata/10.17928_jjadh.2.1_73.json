Many of these articles have been negotiated and edited for a decade or more, and the history of that editing can provide insight into the recent history of ideas. This paper describes the development of a tool called WIScker that works with the Wikipedia Application Programming Interface (API) to scrape, or \"wisck,\" the revision history of any Wikipedia article, in order to build a corpus for subsequent text analysis and visualization. As an example, we examine a fourteen-year revision history of the article \"Terrorism,\" first introduced into Wikipedia in October 2001, the month after 9/11, and subsequently expanded to provide a more historically informed, though still politically motivated, entry.", "article_title": "WIScking Ideas", "authors": [{"given": "Andrea", "family": "Budac", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Geoffrey", "family": "Rockwell", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Zachary", "family": "Palmer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Budac", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Alberta", "normalized_name": "University of Alberta", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0160cpw27", "GRID": "grid.17089.37"}}]}, {"given": "Todd", "family": "Suomela", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bucknell University", "normalized_name": "Bucknell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00fc1qt65", "GRID": "grid.253363.2"}}]}, {"given": "St√©fan", "family": "Sinclair", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "McGill University", "normalized_name": "McGill University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01pxwe438", "GRID": "grid.14709.3b"}}]}, {"given": "Stan", "family": "Ruecker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "normalized_name": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/047426m28", "GRID": "grid.35403.31"}}]}, {"family": "the INKE Team", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2188-7276", "type": "electronic"}]}
