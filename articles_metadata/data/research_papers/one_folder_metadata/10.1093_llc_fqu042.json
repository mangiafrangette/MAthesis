Emotions, for instance, are felt intensely if they are associated with unexpected events. The problem with generating unexpected situations is that either characters, or the whole story, are at risk of being no longer believable. This issue is one of the main problems that make story design a hard task. Writers face it on a case by case basis. The automatic generation of interesting stories requires formal criteria to decide to what extent a given situation is unexpected and to what extent actions are kept believable. This paper proposes such formal criteria and makes suggestions concerning their use in story generation systems.", "article_title": "Can believable characters act unexpectedly?", "authors": [{"given": " Antoine", "family": "Saillenfest", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Telecom ParisTech, France", "normalized_name": "Télécom ParisTech", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01naq7912", "GRID": "grid.463717.0"}}]}, {"given": " Jean-Louis", "family": "Dessalles", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Telecom ParisTech, France", "normalized_name": "Télécom ParisTech", "country": "France", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01naq7912", "GRID": "grid.463717.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "29", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
