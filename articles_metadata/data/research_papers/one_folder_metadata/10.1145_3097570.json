However, unlocking the potential of Web archives for humanities scholars and social scientists requires a scalable analytics infrastructure to support exploration of captured content. We present Warcbase, an open-source Web archiving platform that aims to fill this need. Our platform takes advantage of modern open-source “big data” infrastructure, namely Hadoop, HBase, and Spark, that has been widely deployed in industry. Warcbase provides two main capabilities: support for temporal browsing and a domain-specific language that allows scholars to interrogate Web archives in several different ways. This work represents a collaboration between computer scientists and historians, where we have engaged in iterative codesign to build tools for scholars with no formal computer science training. To provide guidance, we propose a process model for scholarly interactions with Web archives that begins with a question and proceeds iteratively through four main steps: filter, analyze, aggregate, and visualize. We call this the FAAV cycle for short and illustrate with three prototypical case studies. This article presents the current state of the project and discusses future directions.", "article_title": "Warcbase", "authors": [{"given": "Jimmy", "family": "Lin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Waterloo, ON, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Waterloo", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01aff2v68", "GRID": "grid.46078.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Ian", "family": "Milligan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Waterloo, ON, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Waterloo", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01aff2v68", "GRID": "grid.46078.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Jeremy", "family": "Wiebe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Waterloo, ON, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Waterloo", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01aff2v68", "GRID": "grid.46078.3d"}}]}, {"given": "Alice", "family": "Zhou", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Waterloo, ON, Canada", "normalized_name": "University of Waterloo", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01aff2v68", "GRID": "grid.46078.3d"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2017-08-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "10", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
