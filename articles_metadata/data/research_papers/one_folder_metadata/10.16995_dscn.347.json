A true cultural, editorial and generational phenomenon in Italy, it is considered emblematic of the network culture and is considered a pioneer of the collision between old and new medias. Thanks to digital technology, we are indeed participating in the multiplication of textualities. Forums, blog, novel, collective forms of writing all are being born in the world of the web, redefining textuality in both its form and its content. This evolution is considered here through a perspective of a more general change in cultural sociability. After historicising these changes. We will commit ourselves to an analysis of its use of digital tools as a means of political and literary expression with the goal of highlighting its intellectual approach. We will show that Wu Ming’s use of the net, expanded to literary work, contributes to the entrenchment of a new culture based on another dialectic between producers and consumers of texts, producing a different view on the works. The web becomes a new channel of exchange, of genre contamination, of meaning transmission, and becomes a free space that establishes a new narrative economy and a redefinition of the scholarly domain.", "article_title": "Création littéraire et Web: un cas italien", "authors": [{"given": "Irene", "family": "Cacopardi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université Paul Valéry 3, Montpellier", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2019", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
