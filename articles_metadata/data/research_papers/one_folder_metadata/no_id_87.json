This essay discusses the purpose of doing such a thing, arguing there is a distinct method in the apparent randomness of labelling something e this or that. Far from simply denoting that it might be done with computers (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an emergent e-culture that reunites the arts and sciences after two hundred years of separate development within the academy. An e-Culture emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and restrictions of Internet as a research environment. The potential of that environment requires a mindset focussed on collaboration to achieve anything of creative significance.
