We examine the ten possible attributions, gathering evidence from verbal parallels, selected linguistic features, and measures of sentence-length, together with idiosyncrasies of vocabulary and syntax in the ‘doubtful’ essays themselves. We conclude that apart from the essay on London clubs, which he later acknowledged, only one piece can be attributed to Goldsmith with any confidence.", "article_title": "Goldsmith and the Busy Body", "authors": [{"given": " Peter", "family": "Dixon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Formerly of Queen Mary, University of London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": " David", "family": "Mannion", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Formerly of Royal Holloway, University of London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2007-10-26", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "22", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
