These data are usually obtained from computer collation programs. Existing programs either collate every witness against a base text or divide all texts up into segments as long as the longest variant phrase at each point. These methods do not give ideal data for stemma reconstruction. We describe a better collation algorithm (progressive multiple alignment) that collates all witnesses word by word without a base text, adding groups of witnesses one at a time, starting with the most closely related pair.", "article_title": "Article: Collating Texts Using Progressive Multiple Alignment", "authors": [{"given": "Matthew", "family": "Spencer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 3J5, Canada", "normalized_name": "Dalhousie University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e6qks80", "GRID": "grid.55602.34"}}]}, {"given": "Christopher J.", "family": "Howe", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QW, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004-01-01", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
