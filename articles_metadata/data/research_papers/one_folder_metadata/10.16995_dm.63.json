{"identifier": {"string_id": "10.16995/dm.63", "id_scheme": "DOI"}, "abstract": "The Virtual Lightbox for Museums and Archives (VLMA) is a tool for collecting and reusing, in a structured fashion, the online contents of museums and archive datasets. It is not restricted to datasets with visual components although VLMA includes a lightbox service that enables comparison and manipulation of visual information. With VLMA, one can browse and search collections, construct personal collections, annotate them, export these collections to XML or Impress (Open Office) presentation format, and share collections with other VLMA users. VLMA was piloted as an e-Learning tool as part of JISCâ€™s e-Learning focus in its first phase (2004-2005) and in its second phase (2005-2006) it has incorporated new partner collections while improving and expanding interfaces and services. This paper concerns its development as a research and teaching tool, especially to teachers using museum collections, and discusses the recent development of VLMA.", "article_title": "VLMA: A tool for creating, annotating and sharing virtual museum collections", "authors": [{"given": "Amy C", "family": "Smith", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Classics University of Reading", "normalized_name": "University of Reading", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05v62cm79", "GRID": "grid.9435.b"}}]}, {"given": "Brian", "family": "Fuchs", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computing Imperial College, London", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Leif", "family": "Isaksen", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science University of Southampton", "normalized_name": "University of Southampton", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01ryk1543", "GRID": "grid.5491.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "4", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.63"}
