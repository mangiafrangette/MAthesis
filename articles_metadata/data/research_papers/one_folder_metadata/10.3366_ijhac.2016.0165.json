These cannot be represented as a rectangular grid-like structure (rectilinear weave). A systematic description is essential for enabling weavers to document and secure intellectual property rights, and for preserving their rich cultural heritage. We present a linked data structure for modelling non-rectilinear as well as rectilinear weaving patterns, different from both a grid and a topological representation. We have implemented two editors using the same data structure for two classes of users (non-weaver users and weavers of warp-faced textiles). We describe the data structure and compare the operator sets of the two editors to access it. We give a first evaluation of the editors by showing how they can be used to model the complex structures of real-world textiles.
