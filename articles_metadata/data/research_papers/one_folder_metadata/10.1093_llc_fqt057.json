Phonetic systems try to respond to the succession of sounds that make up a word, based on the irreducible elements used in speaking. In an ideographic system, each word is represented by a single sign that is unrelated to the sounds of the word itself, but expresses the idea which the word represents. The classic example of an ideographic writing system is Chinese. There is a common misunderstanding that treats each Chinese character as a separate sign. Hanzi (the system of Chinese Characters) serves as a kind of common information carrier created and shared by the whole Chinese society, and as such it is obviously neither disorderly nor unsystematic. On the contrary, there must be some intrinsic laws that make Hanzi the most mature ideographic system in the world. As Complex Network analysis has become an effective tool to analyze complex systems, this article aims to use some of these methods to identify such intrinsic laws of the Hanzi system.", "article_title": "Complex network perspective on graphic form system of Hanzi", "authors": [{"given": " Jiajia", "family": "Hu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Chinese Language and Literature, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China", "normalized_name": "Beijing Normal University", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/022k4wk35", "GRID": "grid.20513.35"}}, {"original_name": "Research Center for Folklore, Classics and Chinese Characters, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China", "normalized_name": "Beijing Normal University", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/022k4wk35", "GRID": "grid.20513.35"}}]}, {"given": " Ning", "family": "Wang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "School of Chinese Language and Literature, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China", "normalized_name": "Beijing Normal University", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/022k4wk35", "GRID": "grid.20513.35"}}, {"original_name": "Research Center for Folklore, Classics and Chinese Characters, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China", "normalized_name": "Beijing Normal University", "country": "China", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/022k4wk35", "GRID": "grid.20513.35"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
