Considering the participants' knowledge of texts and the ability to acquire copyright, the team chooses the ＂Treatise of Historical Figures＂ of the New Edition of Changhua Local Gazetteer, compiled by four of the team members, as the base text. There are several advantages of this choice. First, the biographies in the Treatise are written according to the same format; second, the biographies are rigorously verified; third, they include people from all periods and all walks of life. Therefore, they should be a good starting point for the TBDB project. Besides learning from CBDB's model, the emphasis in developing TBDB is to build attributes for historical figures that are suited for Taiwan's historical contexts. Currently, we have built initial versions of basic search functions, a map which shows the geographical distribution of historical figures, and social network analysis tools. They are now open to the public in order to optimize and debug. In the future, we will continue to increase both the quality and quantity of the database and also develop new analysis tools.", "article_title": "From CBDB to TBDB: The ＂Treatise of Historical Figures＂ of the New Edition of Changhua Local Gazetteer as a Starting Point", "authors": [{"given": "Su-bing", "family": "Chang", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Tsong-han", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Yu-lan", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Chao-jung", "family": "Li", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Ya-wen", "family": "Ku", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Hao-Ren", "family": "Ke", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Shun-Hong", "family": "Sie", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "臺灣數位人文學會 & Ainosco Press", "date": "2018", "keywords": ["digital humanities ", " treatise of historical figures ", " Taiwan Biographical Database (TBDB) ", " text mining ", " social networks analysis (SNA)"], "journal_title": "Journal of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2616-5732", "type": null}]}
