In this article, we present a computer-assisted conceptual analysis methodology applied to a philosophical text. This methodology attempts to be as close as possible to the criteria of the philosophical approach. The method allows a systematic exploration through the multifaceted contexts of a specific philosophical concept. Our methodology is based on the use of a) a concordancer b) a clustering method and c) an interpretative annotation strategy. This method is applied to the concept of evolution in Bergson's corpus.", "article_title": "CARCAT: Computer-Assisted Reading and Conceptual Analysis of Texts: An experiment applied to the concept of evolution in the work of Henri Bergson", "authors": [{"given": "Jean", "family": "Danis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}, {"given": "Jean-Guy", "family": "Meunier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "3", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
