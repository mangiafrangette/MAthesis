The corpus has been designed to provide a firm basis for the study of both the contemporary written Czech (a goal well attainable with the present resources) and the Czech language beyond the limits of contemporary written texts (a long‐term commitment including the building of a corpus of spoken Czech and diachronic and dialectal corpora). The work on the CNC project, now in the eighth year of its official existence, has resulted in the completion of SYN2000, a 100‐million‐word corpus of contemporary written Czech, the organization of the cores of spoken, diachronic, and dialectal corpora, and the finding of workable solutions to some general theoretical problems involved in the building of these corpora.", "article_title": "The Czech National Corpus: Principles, Design, and Results", "authors": [{"given": "K.", "family": "Kucera", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "17", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
