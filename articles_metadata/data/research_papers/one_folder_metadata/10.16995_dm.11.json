The first of these, the CURSUS Project (http://www.cursus.uea.ac.uk), has created electronic editions of medieval Benedictine liturgical service books. The second was some personal research into proof-of-concept conversion of printed volumes of the Records of Early English Drama project (http://www.reed.utoronto.ca/). The final case formed part of a pilot project studying the problems and possibilities of converting legacy electronic resources archived by the Oxford Text Archive (http://www.ota.ox.ac.uk/). While each of these projects was converting from a different form of media—manuscript, print and electronic—they benefitted from many of the same techniques and overcame many of the same hurdles.", "article_title": "Liturgy, Drama, and the Archive: Three conversions from legacy formats to TEI XML", "authors": [{"given": "James", "family": "Cummings", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Oxford, Oxford", "normalized_name": "University of Oxford", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052gg0110", "GRID": "grid.4991.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "2", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.11"}
