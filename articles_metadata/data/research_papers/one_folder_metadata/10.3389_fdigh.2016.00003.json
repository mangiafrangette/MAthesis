In order to enable a systematic research of the knowledge embedded in the manuscripts, there is a need for a formal conceptual data model with a high level of semantic granularity, an ontology. We propose to build a dynamic web-based framework that will allow scholars to create, enrich, and consult an “ontopedia” (ontology-based encyclopedia) of Hebrew manuscripts. The framework is based on an ontology especially designed and implemented for this domain and goals. We view a manuscript as a “living entity” and propose to design a new ontological data model of the narrative for a manuscript, stages/milestones in its biography (creation, copying, and acquisition). A sequence of events and places constitutes a timeline of history against which manuscripts, people, and their relationships can be placed. A large-scale automated reasoning based on the ontology will also enable us to construct a semantically rich social network of people and manuscripts, and to compare the effect of time and place on the manuscripts’ qualitative characteristics and quantitative distribution.", "article_title": "Toward an Ontopedia for Historical Hebrew Manuscripts", "authors": [{"given": "Maayan", "family": "Zhitomirsky-Geffet", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Science, Bar-Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}, {"given": "Gila", "family": "Prebor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Information Science, Bar-Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA", "date": "2016", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Frontiers in Digital Humanities", "volume": "3", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2297-2668", "type": "electronic"}]}
