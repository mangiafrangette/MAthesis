Because it is dynamic, the text on the screen offers the reader many possible kinds of fragmentation. Study of scholarly uses of such texts shows that the segmentations in the text depend on the computer treatments available, such as indexing or linking commentaries. The hypertextual paths induced in such a way by the constraints of indexing systems or on the adjacent commentaries are different from a so-called 'open' reading (in the sense of a reader's engagement), which aims to permit the reader to define paths according to previously determined units. This statement allows us to reopen the debate on the relationship between digitization and hypertextualization. Moreover, it raises questions about the type of reading that emerges from codification and structuring models. The argument of this paper is that the status as object of electronic forms of canonical texts must be reconsidered according to the specific features of the medium.", "article_title": "Pour une lecture ouverte du texte electronique", "authors": [{"given": " A", "family": "Crasson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " Institut des Textes et Manuscrits, Modernes, 45, rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris, France E-mail: acrasson@club-internet.fr ", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
