In the case of Eve, our multiscaled analysis reveals her complex role binding together her social world in ways not previously considered. Only through examining the network do we see that Milton has placed her at the very center of the human universe, providing the primary connection between the reader and the world of God. This example shows promise that our multiscaled network analysis can come to important conclusions about the role of gender in a text, and the method can be expanded outward to come to conclusions about other social identities that likewise remain largely overlooked in current implementations of digital humanities scholarship.", "article_title": "Epic social networks and Eve's centrality in Miltonâ€™sParadise Lost", "authors": [{"given": " Claire", "family": "Ruegg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, Grinnell College, IA, USA", "normalized_name": "Grinnell College", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04tmmky42", "GRID": "grid.256592.f"}}]}, {"given": " James Jaehoon", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Scholarship Center, University of Cincinnati, OH, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Cincinnati", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01e3m7079", "GRID": "grid.24827.3b"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
