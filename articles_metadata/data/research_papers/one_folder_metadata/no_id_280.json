{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Digital Humanities (DH) is a field of research in which humanists at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) can take part and about which they can collaborate in debates and projects. Introducing DH in the academic programs at an undergraduate level can be a difficult path to traverse. Even so, for the academic year 2016, we managed to include a Specialized Seminar-Workshop on this field of study within the History Course at the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras at the UNAM. This article shows and analyzes the context, the methods and the academic, technical and specialization implications DH has in the History field (and in Humanities in general), and also presents the results of our teaching work, of the research project in teaching to which it is connected, and of some other activities which aim at establishing an academic digital culture in this School’s community.
