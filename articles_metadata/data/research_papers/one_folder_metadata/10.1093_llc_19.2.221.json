The focus here is to determine to what extent the stylistic differences among authors can be detected with a high degree of accuracy for a set of texts belonging to a well‐defined register. To that end, the chosen register is characterized by a well‐defined sub‐language, from which a corpus of more than 1,000 documents has been created. To discriminate the texts according to author style, a series of experiments have been performed using statistical techniques. Each text has been represented by a vector covering several linguistic aspects, in an effort to determine the most effective style markers. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can successfully separate the author styles for a given register. An extensive study of the effectiveness of the different variable categories has been performed. For instance, diglossia information on its own is not sufficient for author discrimination. Instead, a systematic evaluation process indicates that part‐of‐speech, structural and algorithmically derived lemma‐frequency variables are the most important style markers, their use leading to an author discrimination accuracy exceeding 90%.", "article_title": "Discriminating the Registers and Styles in the Modern Greek Language-Part 2: Extending the Feature Vector to Optimize Author Discrimination", "authors": [{"given": "G.", "family": "Tambouratzis", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "19", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
