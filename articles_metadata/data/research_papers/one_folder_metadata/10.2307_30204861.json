Normally, any sentence with two or more structural representations is said to be syntactically ambiguous. However, Arabic sentences with only one structural representation may be ambiguous. Our technique for identifying Syntactic Ambiguity in Single-Parse Arabic Sentences (SASPAS) analyzes each sentence and verifies the conditions that govern the existence of certain types of syntactic ambiguities in Arabic sentences. SASPAS is integrated with the syntactic parser, which is based on Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) formalism. The system accepts Arabic sentences in their original script.", "article_title": "Identifying Syntactic Ambiguities in Single-Parse Arabic Sentence", "authors": [{"given": "Kevin", "family": "Daimi", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Detroit", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
