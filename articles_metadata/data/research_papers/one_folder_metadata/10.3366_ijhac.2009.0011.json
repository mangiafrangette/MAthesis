As digital visualisations are spreading rapidly as a tool for research and as a medium of communication in landscape research and archaeology, benefits and limitations are discussed. Published case studies are reviewed and the question whether or to which extent computer game engines may assist in the modelling of past landscapes is evaluated. Therefore a virtual model of Laxton castle (England) is introduced, which was created using SEGA gaming software.
