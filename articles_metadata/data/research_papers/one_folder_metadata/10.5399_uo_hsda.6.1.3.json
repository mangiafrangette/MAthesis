Subsequently, Humanities Computing practice has been prevailingly driven by technological developments and the main concern has shifted from content processing to the representation in digital form of documentary sources. The Digital Humanities turn has brought more to the fore artistic and literary practice in direct digital form, as opposed to a supposedly commonplace application of computational methods to scholarly research. As an example of a way back to the original motivations of applied computation in the humanities, a formal model of the interpretive process is here proposed, whose implementation may be contrived through the application of data processing procedures typical of the so called artificial adaptive systems.", "article_title": "The Origins of Humanities Computing and the Digital Humanities Turn", "authors": [{"given": "Dino", "family": "Buzzetti", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Bologna", "normalized_name": "University of Bologna", "country": "Italy", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01111rn36", "GRID": "grid.6292.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Oregon State University", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Semantic Metadata, Humanist Computing, and Digital Humanities", "volume": "6", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2158-3846", "type": "electronic"}]}
