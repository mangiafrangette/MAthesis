A brief survey of some musical string processing algorithms is given and some issues of melodic representation, abstraction, segmentation and categorisation are presented. This paper is not intended to provide solutions to string processing problems but rather to highlight possible stumbling-block areas and raise awareness of primarily music-related particularities that can cause problems in matching applications.", "article_title": "Pattern Processing in Melodic Sequences: Challenges, Caveats and Prospects", "authors": [{"given": "Emilios", "family": "Cambouropoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Vienna", "normalized_name": "Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04j47vk14", "GRID": "grid.432019.d"}}]}, {"given": "Tim", "family": "Crawford", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Music, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Costas S.", "family": "Iliopoulos", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, King's College London", "normalized_name": "King's College London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33", "GRID": "grid.13097.3c"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
