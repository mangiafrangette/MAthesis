David Walker is the Project Manager of multimedia instructional computing at McMaster University. With the assistance of a small group of medievalists and a programmer-graphic designer they created a multimedia CD-ROM-based program on Women in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The CD-ROM was used in class for the first time in the 1996-7 academic year, and a revised version is currently being distributed by an academic multimedia publisher. This paper presents a synthesis of two perspectives on the development of this teaching resource: teacher and computing professional.", "article_title": "Bringing computing into the Middle Ages: the making of sybils!, a multimedia CD-ROM", "authors": [{"given": " C", "family": "Garay", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " McMaster Working Group on the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Department of French, TSH 522, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4L9 E-mail: garay@mcmail.cis.McMaster.ca ", "normalized_name": "McMaster University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02fa3aq29", "GRID": "grid.25073.33"}}]}, {"given": " D", "family": "Walker", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " McMaster Working Group on the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Department of French, TSH 522, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4L9 E-mail: garay@mcmail.cis.McMaster.ca ", "normalized_name": "McMaster University", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02fa3aq29", "GRID": "grid.25073.33"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
