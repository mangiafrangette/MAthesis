We develop a set of automatic word sense disambiguation techniques to link a Korean word sense collected from a bilingual machine-readable dictionary to a single corresponding English WordNet synset. We show how individual links provided by each word sense disambiguation method can be non-linearly combined to produce a Korean WordNet from existing English WordNet for nouns.", "article_title": "Multiple Heuristics and Their Combination for Automatic WordNet Mapping", "authors": [{"given": "Changki", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, San 31, Hyoja-Dong, Pohang, 790-784, South Korea", "normalized_name": "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04xysgw12", "GRID": "grid.49100.3c"}}]}, {"given": "Gary Geunbae", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Jungyun", "family": "Seo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Computer Science, Sogang University, Sinsu-dong 1, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea", "normalized_name": "Sogang University", "country": "South Korea", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/056tn4839", "GRID": "grid.263736.5"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "38", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
