In the first part, we present the software (Numexco) used in our experiment, focusing on the modular approach of the software. The second part presents the results obtained when we applied Numexco to the thematical analysis of Descartes' Discours de la méthode and his Méditations métaphysiques. This paper also demonstrates how this computer assisted technology can allow the user to rapidly identify, explore and navigate through the different themes found in humanities texts.", "article_title": "NUMEXCO: A Text Mining Approach to Thematic Analysis of a Philosophical Corpus", "authors": [{"given": "Dominic", "family": "Forest", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Laboratoire d’ANalyse Cognitive de l’Information (LANCI)", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Jean-Guy", "family": "Meunier", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM)", "normalized_name": "University of Quebec at Montreal", "country": "Canada", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/002rjbv21", "GRID": "grid.38678.32"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2005", "keywords": ["Text classification, thematic analysis, categorization, text mining, philosophy"], "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1205-5743", "type": "print"}], "journal_title": "CH Working Papers"}
