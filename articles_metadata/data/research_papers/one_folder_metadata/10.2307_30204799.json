This paper describes the knowledge sources used in a disambiguation system able to achieve all three of these criteria. It is a hybrid system combining sub-symbolic, stochastic and rule-based learning. The paper reports the results achieved in Senseval and analyses them to show the system's strengths and weaknesses relative to other similar systems.", "article_title": "Large Scale WSD Using Learning Applied to SENSEVAL", "authors": [{"given": "Paul", "family": "Hawkins", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Durham, Southampton, UK", "normalized_name": "Durham University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01v29qb04", "GRID": "grid.8250.f"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Nettleton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Durham, Southampton, UK", "normalized_name": "Durham University", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01v29qb04", "GRID": "grid.8250.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2000", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "1/2", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
