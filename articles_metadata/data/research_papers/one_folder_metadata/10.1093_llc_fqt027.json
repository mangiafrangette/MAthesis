Stylistic authorship attribution methods based on a multivariate analysis of most-frequent-word frequencies are used in attempts at identifying translators. While these methods usually identify the author of the original rather than the translator, a case study is presented of the Polish translation of a single novel by Virginia Woolf, Night and Day, in which one translator took over from the other; the point of this takeover has been successfully identified with the above-mentioned methods.", "article_title": "The stylistics and stylometry of collaborative translation: Woolf's Night and Day in Polish", "authors": [{"given": " Jan", "family": "Rybicki", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland", "normalized_name": "Jagiellonian University", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03bqmcz70", "GRID": "grid.5522.0"}}]}, {"given": " Magda", "family": "Heydel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland", "normalized_name": "Jagiellonian University", "country": "Poland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03bqmcz70", "GRID": "grid.5522.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "28", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
