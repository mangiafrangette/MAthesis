However, academic caution has led to an understandable reluctance to pass this knowledge to the public through use of reconstructions showing the colour schemes of these monuments. As a result, use of polychromatic reconstruction has been very limited and has made a significant impact on public perception for the classical period, with insignificant progress for many other important monument classes. We argue that large-scale projects to create digital reconstructions are inevitable but that adoption of open workflows is vitally important to achieve the objectives of the London Charter. We demonstrate a practical workflow with two medieval stone crosses.", "article_title": "Open Workflows for Polychromatic Reconstruction of Historical Sculptural Monuments in 3D", "authors": [{"given": "J.", "family": "Mccarthy", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Archaeology, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia", "normalized_name": "Flinders University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kpzv902", "GRID": "grid.1014.4"}}]}, {"given": "E.", "family": "Sebo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Archaeology, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia", "normalized_name": "Flinders University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kpzv902", "GRID": "grid.1014.4"}}]}, {"given": "B.", "family": "Wilkinson", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "College of Science and Engineering, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia", "normalized_name": "Flinders University", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01kpzv902", "GRID": "grid.1014.4"}}]}, {"given": "F.", "family": "Sheehan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Earth Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia", "normalized_name": "University of Adelaide", "country": "Australia", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00892tw58", "GRID": "grid.1010.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2020", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "13", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
