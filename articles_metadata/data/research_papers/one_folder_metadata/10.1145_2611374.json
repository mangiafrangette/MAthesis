The goal of these ISs was manifold: the dissemination, study, and analysis of architectural history. The IS was designed for many types of users. Mainly, we present the interface and the interaction techniques that were conceived and developed for large audiences during expositions, in the museum, or at home. This article presents a special focus on communicative language changes and on the level of information provided, which are determined by the different interfaces adopted over time.", "article_title": "Interacting with the Andrea Palladio Works", "authors": [{"given": "S.", "family": "Baldissini", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio, Vicenza, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "M.", "family": "Gaiani", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna, Bologna, Italy", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2014", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "7", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
