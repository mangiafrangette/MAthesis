A professor in Pediatric Clinical Neuroscience specializing in the study of anger and aggression comments on an analysis of the “Cour amoureuse” offered by a scholar of medieval studies. The exchange reveals that a distinction present in medieval theories of anger seems to have a basis in neurological reality.", "article_title": "Anger and the “Cour amoureuse” of Charles VI: Medieval and Modern Perspectives", "authors": [{"given": "Tracy", "family": "Adams", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Auckland", "normalized_name": "University of Auckland", "country": "New Zealand", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03b94tp07", "GRID": "grid.9654.e"}}, {"original_name": "Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Centre for Medieval and Early Modern Studies", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Potegal", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of Pediatrics", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "University of Minnesota", "normalized_name": "University of Minnesota", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/017zqws13", "GRID": "grid.17635.36"}}, {"original_name": "Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2013", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
