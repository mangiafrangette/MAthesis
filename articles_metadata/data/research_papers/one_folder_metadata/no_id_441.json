While traditional narrative is well equipped to offer an inside view on characters and events, the fictional components in computer games tend to recede into the background during game-play. We will argue that a systematic approach on coupling rules and fiction may offer a solution to this problem. By drawing on Roland Barthes’ research on the functional units of literary texts, adapting it for the interactive medium, we will identify particular aspects of fiction that are most apt to heighten emotional game-play, if strategically integrated into the rule-system.", "article_title": "Barthes Revisited: Perspectives on Emotion Strategies in Computer Games", "authors": [{"given": "Doris C.", "family": "Rusch", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Singapore - MIT GAMBIT Game Lab, Program in Comparative Media Studies, Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "normalized_name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/042nb2s44", "GRID": "grid.116068.8"}}]}, {"given": "Nikolaus", "family": "König", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "IK Senses - Technology - Mise-en-Scene: Media and Perception, c/o Institut für Theater-, Film- und Medienwissenschaft, Universität Wien", "normalized_name": "University of Vienna", "country": "Austria", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03prydq77", "GRID": "grid.10420.37"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
