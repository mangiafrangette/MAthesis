How these variables relate to one another should also be specified. In examining criteria for assessing representativeness of corpora, the concept of range is discussed to stress the evident differences between texts categorized as representatives of a specific genre. Good practices of philological computing are highlighted by illustrating what kind of information can be lost if scholarly rigour is not applied in the process of editing and/or digitizing texts.", "article_title": "Structured text corpora in the study of language variation and change", "authors": [{"given": " Anneli", "family": "Meurman-Solin", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of HelsinkiHelsinki, Finland", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2001", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
