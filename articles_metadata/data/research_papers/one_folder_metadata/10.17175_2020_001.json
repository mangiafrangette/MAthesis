Drawing from anthropology, geography, and media studies, we present two case studies where ethnographic access is challenging: one organic farm in Pakistan, and an NGO that circulates knowledge on psychoactive drugs. On a pragmatic level, we argue that network visualizations based on social media are insightful for difficult fields, but, like ›satellite images‹, they need ethnographic contextualization. On the conceptual level, we understand these networks as complex knowledge networks, where large-scale structures emerge through small-scale action.", "article_title": "Digital methods in difficult ethnographic fields: studying knowledge flows as complex networks through a Facebook analysis", "authors": [{"given": "Lisa", "family": "Krieg", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn", "normalized_name": "University of Bonn", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/041nas322", "GRID": "grid.10388.32"}}]}, {"given": "Julia", "family": "Poerting", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn", "normalized_name": "University of Bonn", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/041nas322", "GRID": "grid.10388.32"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2020", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Zeitschrift für digitale Geisteswissenschaften", "volume": "Heft 5.2020", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2510-1358", "type": "electronic"}]}
