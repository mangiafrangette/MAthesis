The complex task of supporting the construction of a diachronic thesaurus by a domain expert lexicographer has hardly been addressed computationally until now. In this article, we introduce a semiautomatic iterative Query Expansion (QE) scheme for supporting diachronic thesaurus construction, which identifies candidate related terms based on statistical corpus-based measures. We use ancient-modern period classification to increase the performance of the statistical cooccurrence measures and extend our methods to deal with Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs). We demonstrate the empirical benefit of our scheme for a Jewish cross-period thesaurus and evaluate its impact on recall and on the effectiveness of the lexicographerâ€™s manual efforts.", "article_title": "Semiautomatic Construction of Cross-Period Thesaurus", "authors": [{"given": "Chaya", "family": "Liebeskind", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bar-Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}, {"given": "Ido", "family": "Dagan", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bar-Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}, {"given": "Jonathan", "family": "Schler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Bar-Ilan University, Israel", "normalized_name": "Bar-Ilan University", "country": "Israel", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03kgsv495", "GRID": "grid.22098.31"}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2016-12-20", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "9", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
