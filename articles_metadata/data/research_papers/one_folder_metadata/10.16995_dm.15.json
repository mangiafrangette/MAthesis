The work of forensic document analysts on feature-extraction is considered, particularly the algorithms developed for automatic handwriting-recognition by Srihari, and by Bulacu and Schomaker. Automatic clustering is also considered using the AutoClass package. Preliminary results of the authorâ€™s own experiments with these approaches are presented, and some of the obstacles are outlined which must be overcome before a practical system can be developed for the automatic identification of medieval scribes.", "article_title": "Palaeography and Image-Processing: Some Solutions and Problems", "authors": [{"given": "Peter A.", "family": "Stokes", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Cambridge", "normalized_name": "University of Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/013meh722", "GRID": "grid.5335.0"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-05-31", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Medievalist", "volume": "3", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "1715-0736", "type": "electronic"}], "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.16995/dm.15"}
