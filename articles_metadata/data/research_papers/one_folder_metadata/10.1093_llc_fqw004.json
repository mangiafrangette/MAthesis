With information extracted from 503 World Trade Center Task Force Interviews comprising 12,000 pages of testimony and novel visualization techniques, this article proposes a computational method for the emergence of narratives that cross beyond the boundaries of one interview. These assembled narratives, in cases like that of Chief Ganci, can document those who did not survive to tell their own story.", "article_title": "Visualizing Computational, Transversal Narratives from the World Trade Towers", "authors": [{"given": " Ben", "family": "Miller", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Departments of English and Communication, Georgia State University", "normalized_name": "Georgia State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qt6ba18", "GRID": "grid.256304.6"}}]}, {"given": " Ayush", "family": "Shrestha", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "IEEE Member", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": " Jennifer", "family": "Olive", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, Georgia State University", "normalized_name": "Georgia State University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/03qt6ba18", "GRID": "grid.256304.6"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
