Integrating digital library, data grid, and persistent archive technologies, Chronopolis has created trusted environments that span academic institutions and research projects, with the goal of long-term digital preservation.A key goal of the Chronopolis project is to provide cross-domain collection sharing for long-term preservation. Using existing high-speed educational and research networks and mass-scale storage infrastructure investments, the partnership is leveraging the data storage capabilities at SDSC, NCAR, and UMIACS to provide a preservation data grid that emphasizes heterogeneous and highly redundant data storage systems.In this paper we will explore the major themes within Chronopolis, including:a) The philosophy and theory behind a nationally federated data grid for preservation. b) The core tools and technologies used in Chronopolis. c) The metadata schema that is being developed within Chronopolis for all of the data elements. d) Lessons learned from the first year of the project.e) Next steps in digital preservation using Chronopolis: how we plan to strengthen and broaden our network with enhanced services and new customers.", "article_title": "Chronopolis Digital Preservation Network", "authors": [{"given": "David", "family": "Minor", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UC San Diego, San Diego Supercomputer Center", "normalized_name": "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04mg3nk07", "GRID": "grid.419957.7"}}]}, {"given": "Don", "family": "Sutton", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UC San Diego, San Diego Supercomputer Center", "normalized_name": "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04mg3nk07", "GRID": "grid.419957.7"}}]}, {"given": "Ardys", "family": "Kozbial", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UC San Diego Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Brad", "family": "Westbrook", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "UC San Diego Libraries", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Burek", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "National Center for Atmospheric Research", "normalized_name": "National Center for Atmospheric Research", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05cvfcr44", "GRID": "grid.57828.30"}}]}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Smorul", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Edinburgh University", "date": "2010-06-22", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Curation", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}
