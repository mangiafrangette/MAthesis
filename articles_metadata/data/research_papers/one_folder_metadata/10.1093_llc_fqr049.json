Certain types of relative clause, namely that-relatives and zero relatives, were difficult to retrieve from plain-text corpora. Studies therefore either relied on manual extraction of data or a subset of possible relativization strategies. In some text types, however, the zero relative is an important member of the class of possible relativizers. Recent advances in syntactic annotation should have made that-relatives and zero relatives more accessible to automatic retrieval. In this article, we test precision and recall of searches on a modest-sized corpus, i.e. scientific texts from ARCHER (A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers), as a preliminary to future work on the large corpora which are increasingly becoming available. The parser retrieved some false positives and at the same time missed some relevant data. We discuss structural reasons for both kinds of shortcoming as well as the possibilities and limitations of parser adaptation.", "article_title": "Retrieving relatives from historical data", "authors": [{"given": " Marianne", "family": "Hundt", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Zurich, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02crff812", "GRID": "grid.7400.3"}}]}, {"given": " David", "family": "Denison", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "The University of Manchester, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Manchester", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/027m9bs27", "GRID": "grid.5379.8"}}]}, {"given": " Gerold", "family": "Schneider", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Zurich, Switzerland", "normalized_name": "University of Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02crff812", "GRID": "grid.7400.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2011-12-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "27", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
