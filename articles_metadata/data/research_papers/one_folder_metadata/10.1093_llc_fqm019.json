Our study uses traditional kinds of internal evidence (mainly verbal parallels) together with evidence from selected linguistic features. A preliminary analysis identifies features which best distinguish Goldsmith samples from those of a number of contemporary authors. Using this selection of features, we calculate the distances of the fifteen Weekly items from the cluster of Goldsmith samples; an item at too large a distance is unlikely to be his. A parallel investigation is based on sentence-length statistics. We conclude that seven essays may plausibly be assigned to Goldsmith, that he probably co-authored two pieces, and that in three cases he merely made minor additions to material from other sources.", "article_title": "Goldsmith's Contributions to the Weekly Magazine", "authors": [{"given": " Peter", "family": "Dixon", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Queen Mary, University of London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}, {"given": " David", "family": "Mannion", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Royal Holloway, University of London, UK", "normalized_name": "University of London", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/04cw6st05", "GRID": "grid.4464.2"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2007", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "22", "issue": "4", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
