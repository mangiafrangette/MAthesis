Although differences in these disciplines dictate different kinds of work with corpora, many of their respective methods either are applied or could be applicable in the other disciplines. With the recent emergence of richly annotated multi-level and multi-purpose corpora in mind, we review differences and similarities in research questions, corpus resources and their qualitative and quantitative exploitation in the three disciplines, along with suggestions for further development and mutual enrichment.", "article_title": "Three Views on Corpora: Corpus Linguistics, Literary Computing, and Computational Linguistics", "authors": [{"given": "Anke", "family": "Lüdeling", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institut für deutsche Sprache und Linguistik", "normalized_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hcx6992", "GRID": "grid.7468.d"}}]}, {"given": "Amir", "family": "Zeldes", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institut für deutsche Sprache und Linguistik", "normalized_name": "Humboldt University of Berlin", "country": "Germany", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/01hcx6992", "GRID": "grid.7468.d"}}]}], "publisher": null, "date": "2008", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Jahrbuch für Computerphilologie", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": null, "type": null}]}
