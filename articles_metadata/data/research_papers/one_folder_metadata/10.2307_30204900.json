The earliest works in dialectology showed that language variation is complex both geographically and linguistically and cannot be reduced to simple characterizations. There has thus always been a perceived need for techniques which can deal with large amounts of data in a controlled means, i.e. computational techniques. This special issue of Computers and the Humanities presents a range of recent work on this topic.", "article_title": "Introducing Computational Techniques in Dialectometry", "authors": [{"given": "John", "family": "Nerbonne", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humanities Computing, University of Groningen, the Netherlands", "normalized_name": "University of Groningen", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/012p63287", "GRID": "grid.4830.f"}}, {"original_name": "Atlas Project, University of Georgia, US", "normalized_name": "University of Georgia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00te3t702", "GRID": "grid.213876.9"}}]}, {"given": "William", "family": "Kretzschmar", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Humanities Computing, University of Groningen, the Netherlands", "normalized_name": "University of Groningen", "country": "Netherlands", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/012p63287", "GRID": "grid.4830.f"}}, {"original_name": "Atlas Project, University of Georgia, US", "normalized_name": "University of Georgia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00te3t702", "GRID": "grid.213876.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer", "date": "2003", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Computers and the Humanities", "volume": "37", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "00104817", "type": "print"}]}
