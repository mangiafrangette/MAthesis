{"url": null, "identifier": {"string_id": null, "id_scheme": null}, "abstract": " Interest in the role of book cover images in readers’ reading experience and book marketing has been long-standing. This study attempts to compare book covers from different countries with a media visualization tool called ImagePlot. The top 100 bestselling books from 13 Amazon.com’s international sites were identified and their cover images were downloaded. Using ImagePlot, median values of brightness, hue and saturation for each image in the data set were extracted and analyzed. Along with one-way ANOVA tests and the resulting graphs from SPSS, ImagePlot outputs show differences in these graphical properties of bestsellers’ cover images in different countries. From the outputs, with all the book cover images displayed on a single canvas (screen), hidden patterns emerged and findings were clearly confirmed. This study makes a contribution by providing connection between research interests in book cover images and media visualization techniques for further research.
