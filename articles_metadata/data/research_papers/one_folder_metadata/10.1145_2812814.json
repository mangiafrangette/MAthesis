Though much attention has been devoted to the preservation of the physical supports of drama (e.g., films and tapes), there is a widespread acknowledgment that such tangible heritage is the expression of an intangible notion of drama. This article introduces drama as a form of intangible cultural heritage and presents a solution for its preservation in terms of a formal encoding through a computational ontology. After the review of a formal representation of drama, called Drammar, developed in previous works, we show how an abstraction of drama can be encoded into a digital item. We also show how the method proposed is compliant with the major initiatives for the documentation of cultural heritage, namely CIDOC-CRM and FRBR. Finally, we test the applicability of our solution by showing how the major tenets of two well-known theories of drama can be encoded in Drammar and presenting the results of a focus group of drama scholars and practitioners who have accessed the encoding through a visualization system. The encoding and visualization system have turned out to be a promising support for teaching and investigating drama.", "article_title": "Safeguarding and Accessing Drama as Intangible Cultural Heritage", "authors": [{"given": "Vincenzo", "family": "Lombardo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Torino", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Antonio", "family": "Pizzo", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Torino", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Rossana", "family": "Damiano", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Torino", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)", "date": "2016", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "1556-4673", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1556-4711", "type": "electronic"}]}
