This is not only a result of the collaboration between the journal’s editor-in-chief, Gábor Palkó, Co-Director of the Centre for Digital Humanities at the Eötvös University, who is interested in the practice and theory of digital archives, and the editor of this volume, Thorsten Ries, who conducts research on born-digital dossiers génétiques with digital forensic methods at Ghent University. It is also meant to be a programmatic call to intensify cross-sectoral collaboration between galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM institutions), digital preservation projects, and humanities research working with digital primary sources.", "article_title": "Born-digital archives", "authors": [{"given": "Thorsten", "family": "Ries", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium", "normalized_name": "Ghent University", "country": "Belgium", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00cv9y106", "GRID": "grid.5342.0"}}]}, {"given": "Gábor", "family": "Palkó", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Sussex, Brighton, UK", "normalized_name": "University of Sussex", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00ayhx656", "GRID": "grid.12082.39"}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
