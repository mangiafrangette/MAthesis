The strong and formulaic conventions of sentimentality as a genre enable me to investigate how text analysis, machine classification, and word cloud visualisations can reveal low-level patterns that correspond to the higher-level formations of sentimentality. Specifically, I use the Naïve Bayes classification algorithm and Dunning's Log Likelihood Ratio (through the MONK Project and WordHoard) to identify instances of sentimentality and isolate the words that are most salient in affective writing. I also use the study to think through issues raised when employing computational text analysis and distant reading to inform critical positions.", "article_title": "Patterns of Sentimentality in Victorian Novels", "authors": [{"given": "Sara", "family": "Steger", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Georgia", "normalized_name": "University of Georgia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00te3t702", "GRID": "grid.213876.9"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
