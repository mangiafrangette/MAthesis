In this work, we use computational techniques to examine the similarity of a wide range of Ancient Greek authors, with a focus on similarity between authors writing many centuries apart. We represent texts and authors based on their usage of high-frequency words to capture author signatures rather than document topics and measure similarity using Jensen-Shannon Divergence. We then analyze author similarity across centuries, finding high similarity between specific authors and across the corpus that is not common to all languages.", "article_title": "Like Two Pis in a Pod: Author Similarity Across Time in the Ancient Greek Corpus", "authors": [{"given": "Grant", "family": "Storey", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cornell University", "normalized_name": "Cornell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bnh6r87", "GRID": "grid.5386.8"}}]}, {"given": "David", "family": "Mimno", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Cornell University", "normalized_name": "Cornell University", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/05bnh6r87", "GRID": "grid.5386.8"}}]}], "publisher": "Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures", "date": "2020-07-08", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Journal of Cultural Analytics", "volume": null, "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2371-4549", "type": "electronic"}]}
