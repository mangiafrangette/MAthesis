The interest in historical ‘facts’ suggests methods the goal of which is to create formal representations of the information conveyed by the text in structured databases. This can be achieved with RDF representations of statements extracted from the text, by automatic information extraction methods, or by hand. The paper suggests the use of embedded RDF representations in TEI markup, following the practice in several recent projects, and it concludes with a proposal for a definition of the ‘assertive edition’.", "article_title": "The ‘assertive edition’", "authors": [{"given": "Georg", "family": "Vogeler", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Zentrum für Informationsmodellierung, Universität Graz, Graz, Austria", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "International Journal of Digital Humanities", "volume": "1", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2524-7832", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2524-7840", "type": "electronic"}]}
