These cards represent the most comprehensive collection of digital material pertaining to these death certificates issued by Sonderstandesamt Arolsen, a German civil registry office. However, the reference cards can only be found dispersed throughout the Central Name Index (CNI), ITSâ€™s 46+ million-card finding aid that is indexed only by name. Consequently, aggregating the death certificate reference cards for research requires an intractable manual search. I adopt template matching and machine learning to automate the retrieval of these cards from the ITS digital archive. I demonstrate the efficacy of my method on a test set of 22,117 hand-classified cards, reporting 100% precision and 100% recall. Running this algorithm on 39,967,358 scans of cards from the CNI, I identify 312,183 death certificate reference cards in 13.75 days of elapsed real runtime on a personal computer with only a single, $600 Intel processor. Finally, I demonstrate that this approach can be generalized to many different card types within the CNI, showing great promise for application to other archives.", "article_title": "Machine learning, template matching, and the International Tracing Service digital archive: Automating the retrieval of death certificate reference cards from 40 million document scans", "authors": [{"given": " Benjamin Charles Germain", "family": "Lee", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Levine Institute for Holocaust Education", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}, {"original_name": "Visiting Fellow, Department of History, Harvard University Cambridge, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2018-10-24", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "34", "issue": "3", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
