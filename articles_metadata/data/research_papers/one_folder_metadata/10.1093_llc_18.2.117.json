At the same time, the proliferation of approaches to using these new technologies is causing serious problems relating to resource discovery and resource creation. This paper describes the infrastructure that the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) has built to address these problems. Its technical and usage infrastructures address problems of resource discovery by constructing a single virtual library of distributed resources. Its governance infrastructure addresses problems of resource creation by providing a mechanism through which the language‐resource community can express its consensus on recommended best practices.", "article_title": "The Open Language Archives Community: An Infrastructure for Distributed Archiving of Language Resources", "authors": [{"given": "G.", "family": "Simons", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "18", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
