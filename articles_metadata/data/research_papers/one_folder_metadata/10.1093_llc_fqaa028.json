In doing so, this essay argues that markup languages offer not only a means for analyzing encoded documents but also a means for analyzing critical approaches to documents. Because markup language reflects the critical stance of whoever produces the encoding, any revision to the markup potentially reflects a revision to the critical theoretical framework from which the encoder operates. As such, implementation of markup language in comics studies can function not only as a metalanguage for describing comics but also as a form of meta-criticism. To this end, this essay explores methods for incorporating CBML and TEI to reflect commonly opposed approaches to analyzing comics documents.", "article_title": "On the use of XML markup language in comics criticism", "authors": [{"given": " Jacob", "family": "Murel", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Department of English, Northeastern University, USA", "normalized_name": "Universidad del Noreste", "country": "Mexico", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/02ahky613", "GRID": "grid.441462.1"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2020-04-09", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "", "issue": "", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
