The authors of this article use stylometric methods to provide evidence for a claim about the authorship of the story and to analyze the nature of Eddy’s collaboration with Lovecraft. Further, we extend Rybicki, Hoover, and Kestemont’s (Collaborative authorship: Conrad, Ford, and rolling delta. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 2014; 29, 422–31) analysis of stylometry as it relates to collaborations in order to reveal the necessary considerations for employing a stylometric approach to authorial collaboration.", "article_title": "Stylometry and collaborative authorship: Eddy, Lovecraft, and ‘The Loved Dead’", "authors": [{"given": "Alexander A.
