While several libraries have funded projects which acknowledge the need to digitize other forms of text, few have extended the digital projects to include film, much less performed texts. Further, as more performing arts incorporate born-digital elements, use digital tools to create media-rich performance experiences, and look to the possibility for digital preservation of the performance text, the capture of the performance event and its born-digital artefacts must be considered. This article, then, presents a first look at the ARTeFACT project, undertaken at the University of Virginia Library in collaboration with an introductory course in Engineering and a student choreographer at Brenau University Women's College. Historical intersections of technology and dance are introduced, theoretical concerns of using technology in dance are considered, the processes involved in the creation, capture, and preservation of dance data are discussed along with the technologies used to produce an interactive dance performance.", "article_title": "Performance as digital text: Capturing signals and secret messages in a media-rich experience", "authors": [{"given": " Jama S.", "family": "Coartney", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Digital Media Laboratory, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA", "normalized_name": "University of Virginia", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/0153tk833", "GRID": "grid.27755.32"}}]}, {"given": " Susan L.", "family": "Wiesner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University Libraries, University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC, USA", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2009", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
