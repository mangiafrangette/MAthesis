Since humanities computing owes its existence to developments in recent technology, and needs to become historically self‐aware to be fully of the humanities, work toward an historiography of recent things is deeply relevant. In this essay I draw on this work to highlight the difficulties and opportunities of such an historiography, in particular its ethnographic character and the tempting lure of prediction. I focus on the crucial question of tacit object‐knowledge, concluding that it is gained by concernful action. I recommend that we awaken from a progress‐and‐democratization chronicle to a genuine history of scholarly technology.", "article_title": "As It Almost Was: Historiography of Recent Things", "authors": [{"given": "W.", "family": "McCarty", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "19", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
