At first glance, it seems there is little in common between these efforts: readers argue that setting a Steinian text to music is a welcome abstraction that brings the text to new heights of expression, while computing them seems to concretise their subtleties and diminish their expressive possibilities. I argue that it is the situated hermeneutical framework in which visualisations, like musical scores, invite us to \"play,\" that guides our scholarly, interpretive performances with Stein’s texts. In particular, the visualisations I introduce here help us reconsider the significance of oral traditions in Stein’s self-proclaimed magnum opus, The Making of Americans.", "article_title": "Distant Listening or Playing Visualisations Pleasantly with the Eyes and Ears", "authors": [{"given": "Tanya", "family": "Clement", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "University of Texas at Austin", "normalized_name": "The University of Texas at Austin", "country": "United States", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hj54h04", "GRID": "grid.89336.37"}}]}], "publisher": "Open Library of the Humanities", "date": "2017-10-19", "keywords": [], "journal_title": "Digital Studies/Le champ numérique", "volume": "3", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "1918-3666", "type": "electronic"}]}
