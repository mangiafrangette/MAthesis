The project itself has been a huge challenge for the Móricz-research group because they can only partially rely on the earlier paper-based edition. Drawing on the experiences and resolved problems of the first years of the project, this paper focuses on the harmonization and relationship of a museum's programming/IT possibilities, the philological problems and the applied software capacities. As the paper discusses the challenges of an ongoing project, the study does not offer a holistic and comprehensive overview of the entire project, rather a list of problems as encountered along the way and their solutions.", "article_title": "The Digital Critical Edition of the Correspondence of Zsigmond Móricz (1892–1913)", "authors": [{"given": "Kómár", "family": "Éva", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Cséve", "family": "Anna", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}, {"given": "Fellegi", "family": "Zsófia", "affiliation": [{"original_name": null, "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE)", "date": "2018", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digitális Bölcsészet", "volume": "1", "issue": null, "ISSN": [{"value": "2630-9696", "type": "electronic"}]}
