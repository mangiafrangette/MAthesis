By a stroke of good fortune, the inventory of Rix de Cura's bookshop holdings, totalling 5,261 volumes, has been preserved. An invaluable source for the circulation of classical and humanistic texts in late-fifteenth-century Valencia, the inventory includes an astonishing number of Latin books (with an indication of the number of copies held at the bookshop), mostly imported from Venice.", "article_title": "Books and Readers in Late-Fifteenth-Century Valencia: The Inventory of Joan Rix de Cura (1490)", "authors": [{"given": "Alejandro", "family": "Coroleu", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "ICREA—Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona", "normalized_name": "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052g8jq94", "GRID": "grid.7080.f"}}]}, {"given": "Montserrat", "family": "Ferrer", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona", "normalized_name": "Autonomous University of Barcelona", "country": "Spain", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/052g8jq94", "GRID": "grid.7080.f"}}]}], "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2162-9552", "type": "electronic"}]}
