A publicly accessible online working environment for scholarly editions would allow research assistants to receive proper credit for their intellectual labor, and would reach out to the worldwide audience of scholars, students, and amateur enthusiasts, potentially building public support for a kind of scholarly activity that is threatened within the academy. Two ongoing projects in which the author is involved are used as illustrations of the way this can work, the Online Corpus of Old English Poetry and the Cotton Nero A.x.
