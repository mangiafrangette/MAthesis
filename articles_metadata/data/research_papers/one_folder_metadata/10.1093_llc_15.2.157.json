This paper explores the use of committees of cumulative sum charts based on line-by-line tallies of prosodic features and relative frequencies of both rare-words and common function words, assembled together and focused, as it were, by means of principal component analysis to provide a single best-fit profile of the play. Such a profile casts light, with some amendments, on previously remarked textual features of the play - notably thematic links between Acts II and IV, which contrast with the overall theme of the play. The divergence of Acts II and IV, on the one hand, and Acts I, III, and V on the other, a feature of several other plays with divided authorship, is suggestive of a Marlovian framework, reworked and added to by Shakespeare, possibly after Marlowe's death in 1593. The results of the analysis are compared with recent logometric examinations of the play's authorship. Agreement is greater than disagreement.", "article_title": "Edward III", "authors": [{"given": " T", "family": "Merriam", "affiliation": [{"original_name": " 35 Richmond Road, Basingstoke, RG21 5NX, UK  E-mail: tom@merriam.freeserve.co.uk ", "normalized_name": null, "country": null, "identifiers": {"ror": null, "GRID": null}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2004-11-11", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Literary and Linguistic Computing", "volume": "15", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "0268-1145", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1477-4615", "type": "electronic"}]}
