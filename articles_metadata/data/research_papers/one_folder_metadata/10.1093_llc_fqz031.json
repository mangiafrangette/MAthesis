The problem is compounded by differences in genre, register and style, but in particular by our frequent dependence on much later copies of lost originals. This article examines how a method of classification with flexible time intervals has been developed for a corpus of medieval Irish annals (c.700â€“c.1600). It is shown that the method can deal successfully with an unparsed, complex corpus containing contaminated data. A method of extending the model from good quality, uncontaminated data to more complex texts is also demonstrated by identifying temporal characteristics and typical entries in the high-quality source.", "article_title": "Dating medieval texts by classification with flexible time intervals", "authors": [{"given": " Gregory", "family": "Toner", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Queen's University Belfast, UK", "normalized_name": "Queen's University Belfast", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hswnk62", "GRID": "grid.4777.3"}}]}, {"given": " Xiwu", "family": "Han", "affiliation": [{"original_name": "Queen's University Belfast, UK", "normalized_name": "Queen's University Belfast", "country": "United Kingdom", "identifiers": {"ror": "https://ror.org/00hswnk62", "GRID": "grid.4777.3"}}]}], "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)", "date": "2019", "keywords": null, "journal_title": "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities", "volume": "35", "issue": "2", "ISSN": [{"value": "2055-7671", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2055-768X", "type": "electronic"}]}
