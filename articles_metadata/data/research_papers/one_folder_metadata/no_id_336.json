Since technologies have illocutionary force, we should ask of any representation of history, In what ways are the associated technologies conveying meaning? In this article, the question will be asked of a particular kind of history, textual history, taking biblical texts as an illustrative example. The goal is to better understand how textual technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow capture or obscure the material history of their texts. The article proceeds in two main parts. First, two kinds of technologies commonly used are examined and compared: the non-digital book and its familiar digital counterparts. Second, we will consider ways in which augmented reality and virtual reality have been used and might be used to represent texts. It will be suggested that these new technologies may overcome some of the limitation of previous book technologies in capturing a textâ€™s history. In conclusion, practical suggestions will be made for those who read, study, or produce digital textual objects.
