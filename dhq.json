Despite the claims of some A.I.\n                    proponents, computer scientists seem a long way from being able to design\n                    algorithms that match the interpretive skills and subtlety of human readers.\n                    Nevertheless, we believe we have supplied one proof of the concept that machine\n                    learning applied to big data sets can support this essential aspect of human\n                    scholarship by supplying tools for both discovery and representation of specific\n                    arguments in a specific content domain. And if we now return to the broad\n                    context of critical reading and writing in which our research is placed, we\n                    argue that we have made significant technical and conceptual steps in moving\n                    towards tools that could enhance and empower this process for learners and\n                    scholars alike. This is particularly important in our contemporary digital\n                    landscape, where there is arguably an increasing need within the academy and\n                    without, to identify and understand reasoned and evidenced argument, to combat,\n                    for example, just simply  or , or\n                    , or not, simple emotive propositions and arguments."}, "In the application of digital tools to the humanities, we must also be mindful\n                    that high-sounding rhetoric about civic engagement, the democratization of\n                    scholarship, etc., can be undermined by the facts surrounding the choice of\n                    sources and limitations of access to the materials analysed. In our case,\n                    because of the association between HathiTrust and Google Books, some may worry\n                    (incorrectly in our estimation) that, despite its origins and continuation in\n                    publicly-funded universities, the HathiTrust nevertheless represents the sort of\n                    corporatisation of higher education that some find undesirable. Whereas we\n                    accept that there will always be challenging issues concerning which\n                    repositories to focus on, from a scholarly practice perspective our position is\n                    clear. We want to improve and democratize the scholarly practice of finding and\n                    interpreting arguments, so that argumentative and critical meaning making is\n                    potentially more inclusive, in addition to supporting deeper inquiry for those\n                    who are already engaging in such practice."]}, {"head": "Conclusions", "p": [{"term": "scaffolds", "q": "fit the pieces together", "#text": "The research described in this article tackled a complex problem of how to\n                    investigate and design a technological platform that empowers and supports, or\n                        , humanistic practices guiding a non-expert to perform\n                    the kind of search, argument identification, and interpretation of an\n                    experienced or expert scholar.
